<p>Single-celled organisms use mitosis to reproduce while multi-cellular organisms use mitosis to grow (this allows the organism to get larger while the cells remain small and thus preserve their surface area to volume ratio).&nbsp; The dynamic process of mitosis takes many eukaryotic cells about 1-3 hours to complete. During this time, the cell completes a number of stages. Often the process is simplified and drawn as discrete steps, but it is important to remember that these steps represent landmarks in a continuous process.</p>
<p>The chromosomes that were replicated during the S phase are partitioned so that each new daughter cell has a complete set of chromosomes.&nbsp;<strong>Karyokinesis</strong>&nbsp;is defined as the separation of the chromosomes. The organelles and other cytoplasmic components that were replicated during G<sub>1</sub>, S, and G<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;are partitioned in a process known as&nbsp;<strong>cytokinesis</strong>.</p>
<p>To determine which stage of cell division is occurring during mitosis, we will focus on the behavior and movement of the chromosomes. The stages of mitosis are prophase, prometaphase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase.&nbsp;</p>
