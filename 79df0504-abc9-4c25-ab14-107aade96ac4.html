<p>A&nbsp;<strong>population</strong>&nbsp;is a group of organisms that are members of the same species and that live in the same geographical area. While natural selection occurs at the level of the individual, through variations in fitness among individuals, evolution occurs at the population level. The reason for this is demonstrated in the following table:</p>
<table><tbody><tr><td><p></p></td><td><p><strong>Individual</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Population</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Life Span</strong></p></td><td><p>One generation</p></td><td><p>Many generations</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Genetic Characterization</strong></p></td><td><p>Genotype</p></td><td><p>Allele frequencies</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Genetic Variability</strong></p></td><td><p>None</p></td><td><p>Considerable</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Evolution</strong></p></td><td><p>None</p></td><td><p>Can change over time</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

<p>The genotype of an individual is, for the most part, determined at the moment of fertilization and cannot be changed during that individual's lifetime. However, because populations are comprised of many individuals from different generations, the allele frequencies in a population can change over time thus evolve. Population geneticists focus their studies in two areas. The first area is the measurement of genetic variation within a population. Morphological characters (e.g., variations in length, weight, coloration) and molecular characters (e.g., variations in nucleotide sequences of DNA or in amino acid sequences of proteins) are examined and quantified. The second area is the examination of the mechanisms by which genetic variation changes over space and time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The evolutionary forces that can influence allele frequencies will be examined in the next tutorial. In this tutorial we will examine how allele frequencies are used to make predictions about the genotypes of a population.</p>
<h2 id="PopulationGeneticsandEvolution-GeneticVariation">Genetic Variation</h2>
<p>Population geneticists measure the amount of genetic variation found within a population. Variation can be measured within a population and between populations. When there is no variation among the members of a population, the population is&nbsp;<strong>monomorphic</strong>&nbsp;for that particular character; monomorphic means that just one form exists. For example, the population of squirrels (<em>Sciurus carolinensis</em>) on the Penn State campus is monomorphic for coat color; all of the squirrels in this population have gray fur.</p>
<p>However, this is not true of all squirrel populations. At Kent State, the squirrel population is&nbsp;<strong>polymorphic</strong>&nbsp;for fur color (they have either gray or black fur).</p>
<p>Variations in some populations for a given character can be extreme (for example, the variation of shell colors in a species of Caribbean snail).</p>
<p>Other factors, besides genetics, can contribute to the variation of a character within a population. For example, phenotypes can be affected by the environment. When you spend a lot of time in the sun, your skin becomes darker than the color that is determined by your genotype. As you learned, the genetic disorder PKU &nbsp;can be suppressed by diet. Other examples of environmental alterations are all around us. No two trees look exactly alike because branching patterns and leaf and limb numbers can be influenced by light, water, and nutrient availability. In humans, IQ and size have been linked to diet in babies and young children.&nbsp; In short, the environment can influence how genetic information is expressed.</p>

<h2 id="PopulationGeneticsandEvolution-TheGeneticCompositionofaPopulation">The Genetic Composition of a Population</h2>
<p>In previous tutorials we examined the genotypes of individuals and how they relate to the phenotypes expressed in subsequent generations. Keep in mind, the genotype of an individual becomes fixed the moment that two gametes unite to form the diploid zygote (barring mutation). However, a population consists of a group of individuals that &nbsp;may differ genotypically from one another. How do we describe the genotype of a population?</p>
<p>The genetic makeup of a population can be described by the frequency of alleles that exist in that population. This is typically expressed as a fractional equivalent of one. In other words, a population that has only one allele for a particular gene has an allele frequency of one for that allele. If two or more alleles for a particular gene exist, then each has an allele frequency that is some fraction of one (however, all of the allele frequencies must add up to one). In the example of cystic fibrosis, the major CF allele is found at a frequency of 0.04 (4%) in Caucasian populations. This means that the wild-type allele is found at a frequency of 0.96 (96%). Note that 0.96 + 0.04 = 1. Although the number of alleles may be quite variable (some genes have dozens of alleles), the simple arithmetic relationship still applies; that is, the frequencies of alleles for a given gene must add up to one.</p>
<p>Obviously a population can have many genes for which alternative alleles exist. In the human &nbsp;species, about 30% of all genes have two or more alleles. In other words, 70% of the genes are fixed (have an allele frequency of one), whereas 30% of the genes have allele frequencies less than one.</p>
