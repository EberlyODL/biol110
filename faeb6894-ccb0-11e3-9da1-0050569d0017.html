	<p>One final consideration when interpreting a graph(s) is to make sure that the scales of the axes are appropriate--especially when comparing multiple data sets. This is a form of trickery that is often used in the media and in advertising, where the scales are changed to enhance or reduce an effect.</p>

<p>Take the North Atlantic storm data once again and see what happens when the axis changes.</p>
<p>It becomes immediately apparent that the trend looks far less dramatic when a scale of 0-100 is used as opposed to 7-15. If the Y-axis units were conveniently omitted (which happens a lot when people are trying to push a point of view), you would never know that the graph on the left was hiding the true data trend.</p>
