<p><strong>Chlorophytes</strong>, or green algae, &nbsp;are more closely related to plants than are the other photosynthetic protists. The chlorophylls found in green algae (chlorophyll&nbsp;<em>a</em>&nbsp;and chlorophyll&nbsp;<em>b</em>) are the same as those found in plants. Green algae also store fixed carbon as starch and they have cell walls composed of cellulose. Because they do not have many of the adaptations to a terrestrial environment that plants share, &nbsp;most systematists continue to classify green algae &nbsp;as a separate kingdom, but recognize that land plants arose from within this group.&nbsp; This makes Kingdom Chlorophyta a paraphyletic group.

<p>There is a tremendous amount of diversity within this kingdom. Chlorophytes occupy an array of habitats, including marine, freshwater and terrestrial environments. A number are seaweeds, most are freshwater algae, and some terrestrial chlorophytes (<strong>lichens</strong>) live in a symbiotic association with fungi. The 7,000 species that comprise this kingdom range from unicellular to colonial to truly multicellular. Separate evolutionary events might have led to the evolution from single-celled green algae to colonial organisms (e.g., the beautiful&nbsp;<em>Volvox</em>), to multinucleate single-celled seaweeds, and to multicellular seaweeds (e.g.,&nbsp;<em>Ulva</em>). The photos below show the diversity of this group.

<p>Kingdom Chlorophyta also exhibits many forms of reproduction; most species reproduce asexually and sexually. For example,&nbsp;<em>Spirogyra</em>&nbsp;is composed of long filaments of cells that can break apart and divide to produce new individuals. Alternatively, bridges can form between different individuals, allowing the exchange of gametes.
