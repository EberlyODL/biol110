<h2>Energy V Photosynthesis II Part 3 VoiceThread Transcript</h2>
<p>Slide 1 This question asks you to understand the organization of the photosystems in the light-dependent reactions.</p>
<p>Slide 2 The answer is A - the electron transport chain associated with photosystem I reduces NADP+ to NADPH. Slide 3 This image from the previous tutorial shows the arrangement of the photosystems.</p>
<p>Slide 4 This question asks you to understand what will happen if a photosytem becomes inefficient.</p>
<p>Slide 5 The answer is A - ATP production will decrease.</p>
<p>Slide 6 It is the electron transport chain between photosystems II and I that is responsible for producing ATP - if it becomes inefficient there will be less ATP produced.</p>
<p>Slide 7 This plant is completely white and has no chlorophyll - does it fix carbon dioxide?</p>
<p>Slide 8 The asnwer is no - this plant cannot photosynthesize because it has no chlorophyll. It is a parasite on host plants - its roots grow into the roots of trees and take sugars from the trees. It cannot produce its own sugars.</p>
<p>Slide 9 This question asks you to think about a plant that has an inactive Rubisco.</p>
<p>Slide 10 The asnwer is C - this plant will be unable to fix carbon dioxide. Rubisco is the enzyme that catalyzes the fixation of carbon dioxide to RuBP.</p>
<p>Slide 11 This question asks you to think about what would happen if NADPH was no longer able to become oxidized.</p>
<p>Slide 12 The answer is B. Remember that oxidation is a loss of electrons - this means that NADPH would be unable to donate electrons during the Calvin cycle.</p>
<p>Slide 13 Without the ability to receive electrons from NADPH - the reduction phase of the Calvin cycle could not occur. If you have any questions about these practice problems - please let me know.</p>
