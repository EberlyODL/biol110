<p>Slide 1<br>The classic Mendelian genetic crosses we have looked at thus far in the course only included genes with two alleles and those two alleles had a complete dominant-recessive relationship.&nbsp; This means that one allele - for example the purple flower allele in pea plants - is dominant to the alternative allele - the white flower allele. &nbsp;</p>
<p>However,as we shall see, relationships between alleles are not always dominant-recessive.</p>
<p>Slide 2<br>There are 3 basic "Flavors" of dominance relationships between alleles. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Complete Dominance - "Mendelian inheritance"<br>One allele (dominant) completely masks other (recessive)</p>
<p>Incomplete dominance<br>Both alleles contribute to phenotype, but heterozygote is intermediate to either homozygote (i.e., in monohybrid cross, three phenotypes are observed).</p>
<p>Co-dominance<br>Both alleles contribute equally to phenotype-no masking</p>
<p>Next we will look at some examples.</p>
<p>Slide 3<br>Incomplete dominance occurs when both alleles contribute to the organisms phenotype and the heterozygous individuals have an intermediate phenotype.</p>
<p>An example is flower color in snapdragons.&nbsp; In snapdragons there are two alleles for color - red and white.&nbsp; Notice that the way these alleles are written is slightly different than the way completely dominant/recessive alleles are written. Because neither allele is completely dominant it is not appropriate to use upper and lower case letters.&nbsp; Instead, the gene is named after the character - in this case gene C is for flower color.&nbsp; And the alleles are superscripted - R for the red allele and W for the white allele.</p>
<p>Red flowered snapdragons are homozygous for the red allele and white flowered snapdragons are homozygous for the white allele.&nbsp; Pink flowered snapdragons are heterozygous - pink is a color that is intermediate between red and white.</p>
<p>Slide 4<br>In a codominant relationship - both alleles are equally expressed in the phenotype and the heterozygous individuals have a unique phenotype.&nbsp; We will look at the human ABO blood group as an example.&nbsp; For now - we will just look at alleles A and B (we will talk about allele O later).</p>
<p>The A allele codes for an A sugar that sits on the surface of human red blood cells.&nbsp; The B allele codes for a B sugar that sits on the surface of human red blood cells.&nbsp; If someone has both the A allele and the B allele - they will have both A and B sugars on the surface of their red blood cells.&nbsp; The two alleles are codominant and the heterozygous phenotype is unique.</p>
<p>Slide 5<br>To summarize the relationships between alleles we can look at this dominance continuum.&nbsp; The only way to determine the relationship between alleles is by analyzing the heterozygotes - the homozygous individuals don't tell us anything about how two different alleles interact.</p>
<p>In complete dominance, the heterozygote is indistinguishable from the homozygous dominant individuals. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In incomplete dominance, the heterozygote has a phenotype that is intermediate beween both homozygotes.</p>
<p>In codominance, the heterozygote has a unique phenotype because both alleles are fully expressed.&nbsp;</p>
