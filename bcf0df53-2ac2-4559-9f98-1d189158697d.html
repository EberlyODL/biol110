<h3 id="PlantsIII-VascularFloweringPlants-IntroductionandLearningObjectives">Introduction and Learning Objectives</h3><p>This tutorial will examine the second group of seed plants, the flowering seed plants (sometimes referred to as&nbsp;<strong>angiosperms</strong>). In particular, we will look at their life cycle and how it relates to their flowers and seeds. By the end of this tutorial you should have a basic working understanding of:</p><ul><li>The anatomy of a flower</li><li>The life cycle of flowering seed plants</li><li>The anatomy of a seed</li><li>The role of pollination and seed dispersal in the angiosperm life cycle</li></ul><p>Performance Objectives:</p><ul><li>Identify the characteristics of flowering plants</li><li>Describe the structure of a flower and the difference between perfect and imperfect flowers</li><li>Summarize the life cycle of a flowering plant, identifying the sporophyte, the gametophytes, and when mitosis/meiosis/fertilization occur</li><li>Diagram the process of double fertilization</li><li>Explain the importance of pollen and the different types of pollination seen in this group</li><li>Describe the role of the seed, its relationship to fruit, the different types of seeds, and seed dispersal mechanisms</li></ul><p></p>
