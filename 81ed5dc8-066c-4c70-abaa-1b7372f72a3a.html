<h2>Expression of Multiple Alleles Pedigrees Part 2 VoiceThread Transcript</h2>
<p>Slide 1<br>Human pedigrees describe the interrelationships between parents and children, over generations, regarding a specific trait.</p>
<p>This is in contrast to a Punnett square that allows you to make predictions about future offspring</p>
<p>Slide 2<br>Because relationships between individuals (whether we are talking about humans or pedigreed dogs) can become quite complicated - pedigrees can also become quite complicated.&nbsp; There are symbols to indicate the different types of relationships that can exist.</p>
<p>Slide 3<br>For this class, we will restrict our use of symbols to those that are circled.</p>
<p>Squares refer to males and circles refer to females.&nbsp; If the square or circle is empty - the individual is termed "normal" and does not exhibit the trait that is being analyzed in the pedigree.&nbsp; If the square or circle is filled in - the individual is termed as "affected" with the trait. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Please be aware that the term "normal" has a very specific meaning in genetics that derives from statistics - it means the "norm" or average phenotype and has no connotation about weirdness or strangeness. &nbsp;</p>
<p>If a shape is half-filled in that indicates that the indivdual is a carrier.&nbsp; A carrier is an individual who "carries" a recessive allele but is phenotypically normal.&nbsp; In other words, a carrier is an individual who is heterozygous for a recessive condition.&nbsp; Carriers will not always be indicated on a pedigree - questions on the quiz may require you to determine who the carriers are.</p>
<p>Horizontal lines between a circle and square means that the two are mating partners.&nbsp; Vertical lines that descend from this horizontal line indicate offspring.</p>
<p>Slide 4<br>We see these features in this simple pedigree of a recessive trait.&nbsp; The circle is the female and the square is the male.&nbsp; The line connecting them indicates that they are partners.&nbsp; They have two children a daughter and a son.&nbsp; The daughter is the first born (birth order is indicated left to right).&nbsp; The son is affected by the trait. &nbsp;</p>
<p>But how can we tell that this trait is recessive?&nbsp; Because neither mom nor dad has the condition but the son does.&nbsp; This means that both parents must be carriers for the condition - they are both heterozygous. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Slide 5<br>We can use a Punnett square to reinforce this idea of carriers.&nbsp; If the trait is recessive, both parents can "carry" the allele and not express it - but they can have a child with the condition.</p>
<p>Slide 6<br>This pedigree shows a trait that most likely has dominant inheritance.&nbsp; How can we tell?&nbsp; Well, when we look at the pedigree - there is no evidence of carriers.&nbsp; All affected children have at least one affected parent.&nbsp; So for this pedigree - the most likely mode of inheritance is dominant.</p>
