<h2>Population Genetics Part 5 VoiceThread Transcript</h2><p>Slide 1<br>Gene flow is another factor that can cause evolution in a population. &nbsp;Gene flow refers to the movement of individuals into and out of a population. &nbsp;Gene flow is essentially immigration and emigration. &nbsp;As individuals move from one population to another - they take their alleles with them and have the ability to change allele frequencies. &nbsp;In this graphic, a population of beetles that is predominantly green experiences immigration from a population that is predominantly brown. &nbsp;The result is that the population experiences an increase in the frequency of the brown alleles.</p><p><br>Slide 2<br>A mutation refers to a change in an organisms DNA. &nbsp;Mutation is a normal process - when a DNA molecule is making a copy of itself - it is possible for mistakes to happen.</p><p>These mistakes or mutations are the raw material for evolution - because mutations create new alleles. &nbsp;Think back to the example of eye color in fruit flies. &nbsp;The wild-type allele results in red eyes. &nbsp;A mutation occurred in the gene for eye color and the result is that inviduals who inherited that new allele have white eyes. &nbsp;Mutation has created genetic variation for natural selection to act upon.</p><p>While mutations are an important evolutionary factor - many mutations have little effect on allele frequencies. &nbsp;Why is this? &nbsp;Because most mutations are bad for the organism - many mutations result in death of the organism and dead organisms cannot pass on their genes. &nbsp;Therefore the new allele does not get established in the population. &nbsp;However, every now and then a mutation is beneficial - and the organism that has the mutation benefits. &nbsp;In this case the mutation can get established in the population and affect allele frequencies.</p><p>However, to be passed to the new generation the mutation most occur in germ cells (or sperm and eggs).</p><p><br>Slide 3<br>As an example of a mutation, we can look at the allele that causes sickle cell disease. &nbsp;The allele that causes the disease is the result of a single base pair substition in the DNA. &nbsp;The normal allele has a single base pair different from the disease allele (in all we have 3 billion base pairs that make up our DNA so a single base pair changes is incredibly small but can have a huge impact on the person's phenotype). &nbsp;We can see this single base pair change here - the normal DNA has a T in this position while the mutated DNA has an A. &nbsp;The result is a single amino acid change in the hemoglobin protein - a glutamic acid in the normal protein and a valine in the mutated protein. &nbsp;</p><p><br>Slide 4<br>Mutations are happening all the time as the result of exposure to DNA mutating agents - such as chemicals in the environment (both natural and synthetic) and radiation. &nbsp;For example, sunlight (specifically UVB rays) cause a specific type of mutation known as a thymine dimer which can lead to skin cancer. &nbsp;Luckily, we also have DNA repair enzymes that can fix some mistakes - occasionally, however, the damage overwhelms these systems and cancer can result.</p><p><br>Slide 5<br>Non-random mating is the norm in populations. &nbsp;This means that there is some sort of mate selection occuring. &nbsp;In the example on this screen, The brown beetle on the left is exhibiting random mating - he is equally likely to mate with any of the other color beetles. &nbsp;The beetle on the right, however, is exhibiting nonrandom mating - he only wants to mate with other brown beetles.</p><p>Humans exhibit non-random mating - people of the same cultural, educational and socioeconomic backgrounds tend to partner more than people of different backgrounds do.</p><p>Non-random mating changes genotype frequencies but not allele frequencies because it does not introduce new alleles to a population.</p><p><br>Slide 6<br>Our final factor in evolutionary change is one that we have already talked about - natural selection. &nbsp;Natural selection should have a big star next to it in your notes - because it is the only factor in evolution that results in a population becoming better adapted to its environment than previous generations.</p><p>In this population of beetles there are two color morphs - green and brown. &nbsp;A new species of bird moves into the environment - and it tends to eat the green beetles because&nbsp;<br>they are easier for it to see. &nbsp;As a result, the brown allele increases in frequency in the population and the population becomes predominantly brown. &nbsp;This population is now better adapted to its environment because most of the individuals in the population are hard for the predator to see. &nbsp;</p><p><br>Slide 7<br>Remember that our most concise definition of natural selection is differential reproduction. &nbsp;Those individuals that are better adapted to their environment leave more offspring. &nbsp;The number of offspring an individual leaves is a measure of its fitness.</p><p>If different genotypes have differing fitness - the more fit genotypes will become more common. &nbsp;In our beetle example, the brown beetles were more likely to survive and reproduce and thus the genotype associated with brown color became more common.</p><p><br>Slide 8<br>Fitness is an indicator of reproductive success - the individual that leaves the most offspring has the highest biological fitness. &nbsp;There is a distinction between survivorship and reproductive success.</p><p>An individual can die young but be fit - by having a large number of offspring. &nbsp;Or an individual can die old but lack fitness - by not leaving any offspring.</p><p>Comparisons of fitness can only be made within populations. &nbsp;You cannot compare the fitness of an elephant with the fitness of a mayfly. &nbsp;A female elephant, for example, does not become reproductive until age 13. She can live to be 70 but typically has 5-6 babies during her life. &nbsp;A mayfly by comparison lives minutes to days depending on the species but in that time can have hundreds of offspring. &nbsp;It would not be biologically meaningful to compare the fitness of an elephant with the fitness of a mayfly!&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p>
