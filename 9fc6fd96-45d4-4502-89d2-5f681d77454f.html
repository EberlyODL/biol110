<p>This tutorial has focused on the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis:</p><ul><li>light + water --> NADPH + ATP (oxygen is a by-product)</li></ul><p>Water provides the electrons and protons needed to produce ATP and NADPH and oxygen is released as a by-product of the splitting of a molecule of water. &nbsp;Sunlight is absorbed by chlorophyll and other pigments and excites electrons to a higher energy state. Sunlight is the original source of energy for every step in the process.&nbsp;</p><p>NADPH and ATP provide the electrons and energy that will be used to build a sugar in the light-independent reactions of photosynthesis.&nbsp;</p>
