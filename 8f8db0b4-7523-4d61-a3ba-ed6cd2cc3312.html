<p>This second&nbsp;tutorial on fungi will continue our discussion of fungal diversity by covering the two remaining phyla, Ascomycota and Basidiomycota. By the end of this tutorial you should have a basic understanding of:</p>
<ul><li>The life cycle of Phylum Ascomycota</li><li>The life cycle of Phylum Basidiomycota</li><li>The basic morphology of an ascomycete</li><li>The basic morphology of a basdiomycete</li></ul>
<p>Performance Objectives(these are the same for both the Fungi I and Fungi II tutorials):</p>
<ul><li>Identify the general characteristics of the fungi</li><li>Explain how the “body” of the fungus is adapted for its mode of nutrition</li><li>Diagram the general fungal life cycle and describe the difference between plasmogamy and karyogamy</li><li>Summarize the basic classification of fungi</li><li>Describe the different types of symbiotic relationships that fungi participate in</li><li>For each taxonomic group of fungi, identify the major characteristic(s) of that group and be able to discuss representatives that demonstrate the diversity of the group</li><li>Explain different ways in which fungi impact humans, either directly or indirectly</li></ul>
