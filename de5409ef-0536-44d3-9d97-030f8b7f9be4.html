<h2>Plants II Part 1 VoiceThread Transcript</h2><p>Slide 1<br>The seedless vascular plants were the second major group of plants to evolve. &nbsp;</p><p>Slide 2</p><p>The vascular seedless plants are not a monophyletic group but they all share the characteristic of having vascular tissue.</p><p>Vascular tissue allows the plant to move water and nutrients around the body of the plant - this reduces the chances of desiccation and allows the plant to grow larger.</p><p>In fact, some of the early vascular seedless plants were tree sized - ferns up to 30 feet tall as seen as the artists recreation of what earth may have looked like about 300 million years ago.</p><p>Not only were ferns huge at this time - insects such as dragon flies were as well. &nbsp;Recent research suggests that this is because oxygen levels in the atmosphere were significantly higher and this enabled larger organismal growht.</p><p>Despite the presence of vascular tissue which prevents desiccation - the ferns and other vascular seedless plants retain the primitive characteristics of flagellated sperm so they still require water for reproduction. &nbsp;</p><p><br>Slide 3</p><p>Vascular tissue is specialized tissue that transports water and nutrients around the body of the plant.</p><p>Xylem is the tissue that transports water and mineralse from the soil to other parts of the plant.</p><p>Phloem transports the sugars that are produced by photosynthesis. &nbsp;These sugars are transported all over the plant and can be stored as starch in the roots.</p><p>The vascular plants have true roots, leaves, and stems because they have vascular tissue. &nbsp;Compare this to the rhizoids of the mosses - rhizoids are not true roots because they do not have vascular tissue.</p><p>Lignin is a structural polysaccharide that is associated with xylem. &nbsp;It provides structural support to vascular plants - highly lignified tissue becomes "woody" and strong. &nbsp;Plants with a large amount of lignin can become quite large.</p><p>Slide 4</p><p>Spores are reproductive structures that are adapted for dispersal and surviving for extended periods of time in unfavorable conditions. &nbsp;Typically spores are haploid and unicellular and they are produced by the sporophyte.</p><p>Just like the nonvascular plants - the vascular seedless plants do not produce pollen, flowers, or seeds and they rely on spores for dispersal.</p><p>As we saw earlier, many of the mosses are heterosporous - they produce megaspores which produce female gametophytes and microspores which produce male gametophytes.</p><p>Many of the vascular seedless plants are homosporous - they produce a single spore type which gives rise to a bisexual gametophyte.&nbsp;</p><p>Slide 5</p><p>The vascular plants have a prominent sporophyte generation in their life cycle (in comparison to the nonvascular plants that have a prominent gametophyte).</p><p>While the sporophyte is prominent the gametophyte is still independent (we will see that this changes when we get to the seed plants). &nbsp;An independent gametophyte means that it lives independently for part of the life cycle and is capable of photosynthesis.</p><p>The nonvascular plants are the only ones with a prominent gametophyte. &nbsp;All other plants have a prominent sporophyte so there must be a selective advantage to a prominent sporophyte. &nbsp;What do you think this advantage might be? &nbsp;The hint is that it has to do with UV radiation.</p><p><br>Remember, the sporophyte generation is diploid - it has two copies of each gene while the gametophyte generation is haploid and only has one copy of each gene.&nbsp;</p><p>UV radiation is a mutagen - it mutates DNA. &nbsp;An organism that has two copies of each gene is protected against the negative effects of UV radiation more than an organism with just one copy of each gene.</p><p>The second copy is insurance against mutation.</p><p>Slide 6</p><p>Examples of the vascular seedless plants are the ferns as well as the club mosses and equisetum - also known as horsetails.</p>
