<p>Scientists are always looking for alternative energy sources. Everyone has heard of solar-powered cars, and we tend to think of them as a new technology. Plants, however, have always been solar powered. In fact, humans (and other heterotrophs) are dependent on the ability of plants to transform light energy into chemical energy via the process of photosynthesis. Humans transform stored chemical energy into mechanical energy and heat. Solar-powered cars rely on the sun's energy being transformed into electrical energy (<strong>photochemistry</strong>). In each of these cases energy is being transformed but never created or destroyed. This should be familiar as the first law of thermodynamics.

  <br>Metabolism refers to all of the chemical processes in a cell. It is usually divided into two categories: catabolism and anabolism. Cellular respiration is an example of catabolism, whereas photosynthesis is an anabolic process.&nbsp;
  <br>While most people think of plants when photosynthesis is mentioned algae are responsible for more photosynthesis than plants. It has been estimated that about 90% of the oxygen produced from photosynthesis comes from algae and phytoplankton living in oceans. Plants, protists, and even some bacteria undergo photosynthesis.

<p>Many plants have cells, tissues, and organs that do not photosynthesize. For example, most roots have no photosynthetic capacity. Typically sugars are produced in the photosynthetic tissues and transported to other areas of the plant for immediate nutrition and storage. As already discussed, cellular respiration is required for cells to convert the chemical energy in sugars into ATP. Therefore plants must also undergo cellular respiration in all cells in order to function properly.
</p>
<p>Remember, plants have mitochondria and chloroplasts. Therefore they are able to carry out photosynthesis and cellular respiration.
