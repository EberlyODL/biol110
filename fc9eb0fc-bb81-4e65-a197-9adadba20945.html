<p>Protists are ecologically and economically significant organisms; they are responsible for a large portion of the Earth's fixed carbon and for a number of plant and animal diseases, some of which have caused considerable devastation to &nbsp;humans and their crops. Considering their small size, their diversity is astounding. The beginnings of multicellularity in early protists paved the way for even greater structural complexity and diversity in taxa such as plants, animals, and fungi. For more information on the systematics and taxonomy of protists (and all other life forms), the web site of the University of California-Berkeley's Museum of Paleontology is an excellent resource, although their system of classification differs somewhat from the system used in this course.</p>
<p>We also introduced the slime molds. In a hike through the woods, you might encounter a brightly colored, fungus-like structure spreading over the surface of a decaying tree trunk; most likely, you are observing a slime mold. These are members of the Amoebozoa, the protist kingdom most closely related to fungi and animals.</p>
