<h2>Antiquity of Life Part 2 VoiceThread Transcript&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Slide 1<br>Understanding the story of life on earth means not just understanding all of the different kinds of organisms, but also understanding the ages of these organisms.&nbsp; The fossil record can provide information about when different types of organisms first evolved.</p>
<p>As previously mentioned, most fossils are found in sedimentary rock formations.&nbsp; In general, deeper sedimentary rock layers formed earlier than more shallow layers.&nbsp; Thus, the fossils found in deeper layers are older than fossils found in more shallow layers.</p>
<p>This understanding allows us to assign relative ages to fossils.&nbsp; In other words, this fossil is older than that fossil, but does not allow an absolute date to be determined.</p>
<p>Absolute dating methods allow biologists to determine a more precise age of a fossil.&nbsp; Examples of absolute dating methods are radiometric dating, dendrochronology, and amino acid racemization.</p>
<p>Slide 2<br>Radiometric dating involves looking at the radioactive decay rates of elements such as Carbon-14 and Radium-226.</p>
<p>Each of these radioactive isotopes decays at a constant rate and radioactive decay is measured in half-lives.</p>
<p>A half-life is the amount of time it takes for half of a radioactive element to decay into a daughter product.</p>
<p>Slide 3<br>Radiocarbon dating is a common radiodating technique with good reliability.&nbsp; The half-life of Carbon-14 is approximately 5700 years so this technique can only be used to date objects that are approximately 50,000 years old or less.&nbsp; Objects that are older than 50,000 years have too little Carbon-14 to measure reliably. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Slide 4<br>Let's see a simple example of how radioactive decay can be used to calculate ages of objects.&nbsp; The half-life of radium-226 is 1620 years.&nbsp; Remember, this means that it takes 1620 years for half of the initial amount of radium-226 to decay to a daughter element.&nbsp; If a sample contains 16 mg of radium-226, how much will it contain in 3240 years?&nbsp; Also, how long will it take to contain 1 mg?</p>
<p>Slide 5<br>The answer to the first question is 4 mg.&nbsp; Remember that the half-life of radium-226 is 1620 years - so 3240 years is the same as two half-lives.&nbsp; After one half-life the sample will contain 8 mg of radium-226 (half of 16 mg is 8 mg) and after a second half-life the sample will contain 4 mg of radium-226.</p>
<p>The answer to the second question is 6480 years or four half-lives.&nbsp; The original sample had 16 mg of radium-226.&nbsp; After one half-life there is 8 mg, after 2 half-lives there will be 4 mg, after 3 half-lives there will be 2 mg, and after 4 half-lives there will be 1 mg.&nbsp; Each half-life reduces the amount of the radioactive isotope by half.</p>
<p>Slide 6<br>Dendrochronology is the scientific method of dating based on the analysis of patterns of tree-rings. Dendrochronology can date the time at which tree rings were formed to the exact calendar year.Many trees in temperate zones make one growth ring each year, with the newest adjacent to the bark. For the entire period of a tree's life, a year-by-year record is formed that reflects the climatic conditions in which the tree grew. Adequate moisture and a long growing season result in a wide ring. A drought year may result in a very narrow one as can be seen in this image on the screen.</p>
<p>Slide 7<br>Dendrochronology is generally used to date specimens that are relatively young.&nbsp; In some uses, it can be used to date specimens that are 5,000 years or younger.&nbsp; More typically, it is limited to dating specimens that are hundreds of years old.&nbsp; This limitation is due, in part, to the fact that our old growth forests are endangered and many of the oldest trees have been forested to supply wood for wood products and are no longer available for scientific analysis. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Slide 8<br>Another example of an absolute dating technique is amino acid racemization.&nbsp; Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins (we will learn more about them in future lessons).&nbsp; Outside of living organisms they occur in two mirror image forms - the L and the D form.&nbsp; In living organisms, only the L form exists.&nbsp; After an organism dies, the L-form amino acids change to D-form.&nbsp; This is the process of racemization.&nbsp; The amount of L- versus D-forms in a remain can give information about its age.&nbsp; It is a useful technique because it can be used to date remains as old as 200,000 years.&nbsp; However, it has some important limitations because racemization rates are affected by temperature, humidity, salinity, and pH.&nbsp; So if the conditions in an area are not constant, racemization rates are not constant.&nbsp; This is in contrast to radiometric dating because radioactive decay rates are always contant - decay rates are not affected by environmental factors so radiometric decay provides a more accurate measure of a remains' age.</p>
<p>Slide 9<br>So let's try another practice problem.&nbsp; Attempt this problem on your own and then view the next VoiceThread lecture to see the problem solved.</p>
