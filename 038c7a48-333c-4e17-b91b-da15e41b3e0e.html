<p>As you learned in the previous tutorial, glycolysis results in a net gain of 2 ATP and 2 NADH molecules from one molecule of glucose. Keep in mind, this gain represents an effective transfer of 20 kcal of energy to ATP (about 10 kcal each) and about 80 kcal of energy to NADH (about 40 kcal each), for a total of about 100 kcal. The complete oxidation of glucose results in the release of 684 kcal of energy, therefore, there is significant energy still remaining in pyruvate.
</p>
<p>In eukaryotes, pyruvate is transported across the mitochondrial membrane and then converted to acetyl CoA (with the production of NADH and carbon dioxide). Acetyl CoA is then oxidized by a series of enzymes that make up a cyclical series of reactions known as the Krebs cycle (some textbooks refer to this as the citric acid cycle). During the&nbsp;<strong>Krebs cycle</strong>, electrons are removed from acetyl CoA and these electrons reduce more NAD+, along with another electron carrier,&nbsp;<strong>FAD</strong>. The ATP that is produced is generated via substrate-level phosphorylation, just as it was in glycolysis. Each NADH and FADH<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;molecule that is formed is an important source of energy that will be used to generate ATP.
</p>
<p>While you will not be required to memorize all of the intermediates (e.g., isocitrate, fumarate, etc.) and enzymes involved in the Krebs cycle, this figure demonstrates the overall reactions that result in the complete oxidation of acetyl CoA. You can also see where carbon dioxide is released as a by-product and where electron carriers are reduced to form NADH and FADH<sub>2</sub>. Also note that the ATP formed results from the direct transfer of a phosphate from a substrate (substrate-level phosphorylation).&nbsp;

<p>This figure&nbsp;is a summary of the Krebs cycle, illustrating the main reactants (acetyl CoA, NAD+, FAD, ADP, and inorganic phosphate) and products (carbon dioxide, NADH, FADH<sub>2</sub>, and ATP) from what is actually a multistep process.

<h2 id="EnergyIII-CellularRespiration(KrebsCycleandElectronTransportChain)-TheRoleofNADHandFADH2">The Role of NADH and FADH<sub>2</sub>
</h2>
<p>Glucose catabolism ends during the Krebs cycle. This does not mean that all of the energy previously contained in glucose was used in the production of ATP. In fact, only one additional ATP molecule (per molecule of pyruvate) is produced by substrate-level phosphorylation in the Krebs cycle. The balance of extracted energy is tied up in NADH and FADH<sub>2</sub>.
</p>
<p>In the next phase of cellular respiration, the high-energy electrons within NADH and FADH<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;will be passed to a set of membrane-bound enzymes in the mitochondrion, collectively referred to as the <strong>Electron Transport Chain </strong>(ETC). These electrons will provide energy to do work. Specifically, this work will involve the movement of positively charged hydrogen atoms (H+), also known as&nbsp;<strong>protons</strong>.
</p>
<p>The movement of protons across the inner mitrochondrial membrane (by the electron transport chain) creates a&nbsp;<strong>charge differential (voltage)</strong>&nbsp;that will be used to synthesize ATP.&nbsp;
