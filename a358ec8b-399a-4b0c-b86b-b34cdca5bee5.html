<p>As previously described, meiosis gives rise to genetic variation through the independent assortment of chromosomes and recombination (or crossing-over) between pairs of homologous chromosomes. If we also consider random fertilization, the amount of genetic variation increases greatly. Let's consider the example of a human couple having a child. Over 8 million different genetic combinations are possible in the father's sperm, and an equal number in the mother's ovum. The number of unique genetic combinations would be (8 million) x (8 million) = 64 trillion when a sperm and ovum randomly unite to form a zygote. Therefore, sexual reproduction is an effective way to create offspring with genetic variation.</p>
<p>Why is this important?&nbsp; Populations evolve and adapt through natural selection. In order for natural selection to operate, genetic variation must be present. Genetic variation leads to heterogeneity between generations; if the environment favors one variant, then this advantageous variant will increase in frequency over generational time. If environmental conditions change, individuals migrate, or new predators or pathogens are introduced, then genetic variation may allow a new variant to do better in these new conditions. Therefore, genetic variation is "insurance" for organisms against changing conditions because it helps to insure that some of their offspring will survive if conditions change.</p>
