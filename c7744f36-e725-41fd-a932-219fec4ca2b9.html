<h2>Antiquity of Life Part 1 VoiceThread Transcript&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Slide 1:&nbsp; As we begin our discussion of living organisms, it is important to remember that life has been on earth for a long time.&nbsp; And over billions of years of evolution many different types of organisms have appeared on earth and many have gone extinct. Throughout these 3.5 billion years it is important to remember that the earth's climate and the earth's land masses have changed as well.</p>
<p>This movement of the land masses is known as plate tectonics and results in continental drift.&nbsp; The image on this slide shows you some of the movement of the land masses over time. The constant changing of the environments on earth is one of the factors that causes the evolution of organisms.</p>
<p>Slide 2:&nbsp; The fossil evidence indicates that life on earth began about 3.5 billion years ago.&nbsp; And we know that from a common ancestor, all other life forms arose.&nbsp; This process of evolution has been occurring over the billions of years that life has existed on earth and has resulted in the vast biodiversity that we see on earth.</p>
<p>Slide 3:&nbsp; The National Science Foundation's "Tree of Life" Project estimates that there could be anywhere from 5 million to 100 million species on the planet.&nbsp; But currently science has only identified about 2 million of these species. This means that there are still millions of species left to be discovered -&nbsp; most of them residing in what are known as "biodiversity hotspots" such as tropical rain forests and coral reefs.&nbsp; Many other new species are being described as we gain the ability to explore new environments - such as the deep ocean floors which until relatively recently were inaccessible to us.&nbsp; Another aspect of the evolution of the life on earth is extinction.&nbsp; Many species become extinct when they are no longer able to survive in a changing environment or when they are outcompeted for resources by another species.&nbsp; Biologist estimate that about 99.9% of all species that ever existed have gone extinct.&nbsp; Unfortunately we sometimes can witness extinctions happening.</p>
<p>Slide 4:&nbsp; An example of this may be white nose syndrome in bats.&nbsp; White nose syndrome is a little understood fungal disease that is affecting some species of bats - predominantly in the northeastern United States.&nbsp; While many people find bats to be creepy - they do perform an important ecological service - they eat lots and lots of insects.&nbsp; Including insects like mosquitoes which are notorious for carrying human diseases like West Nile disease. &nbsp;</p>
<p>White nose syndrome was discovered in 2006 in a cave in New York state when bats were found with a distinct white growth on their noses and wings.&nbsp; You can see these white growths on some of the bats on this slide.&nbsp; The bat to the far left of the image does not have white nose syndrome.&nbsp; The name white nose syndrome comes from the fungal growth and the fungus digests tissue on the noses and wings of the bats.&nbsp; This wakes the bats from hibernation and causes severe metabolic destruction which is often fatal for the bat - mortality is upwards of 90%.&nbsp; The disease began in the northeastern part of the US but unfortunately in 2010 was found west of the Mississippi.&nbsp; One species of bat - the little brown myotis - may go extinct in the next 20 years if the spread of this disease cannot be controlled.</p>
<p>Slide 5:&nbsp; The topic of this tutorial is the antiquity of life and much of what we know about organisms that lived a long time ago is from the fossil record.&nbsp; Fossils are the preserved remains of organisms from the past.&nbsp; All of the known fossils are collectively referred to as the "fossil record".&nbsp; It is this record of life that allowed early biologists to begin to tell the story of life on earth.&nbsp; Only some organisms are represented in the fossil record.&nbsp; Most fossils are found in sedimentary rock which is rock formed by layers of minerals that settle in water.&nbsp; So organisms that live in or near water (like lakes and swamps and oceans) are most abundant in the fossil record. There are gaps in the fossil record because the fossil record is biased toward certain types of organisms.</p>
<p>Slide 6:&nbsp; Certain types of organisms are known to fossilize more readily than others. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Slide 7:&nbsp; In general, it is organisms with hard body parts that are found predominantly in the fossil record.&nbsp; Organisms like this fiddler crab that has a hard exoskeleton.&nbsp; Fiddler crabs and other arthropods are abundant in the fossil record while other organisms with soft body parts - such as a plant or a jellyfish - are relatively rare in the fossil record.&nbsp; So the fossil record is a nice record of life on earth but is not a perfect record because of that bias. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
