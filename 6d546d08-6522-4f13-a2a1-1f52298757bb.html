<h3 id="PredictingPhenotypesandGenotypes-IntroductionandLearningObjectives">Introduction and Learning Objectives</h3><p>This tutorial will teach you how to predict the segregation of alleles in the formation of gametes by parents that are heterozygous for different characters. Initially you will work with a tool referred to as a Punnett square, but later you will see how determining probabilities can help you make the same predictions much more easily. By the end of this tutorial you should have a working understanding of:</p><ul><li>The application of Punnett squares for monohybrid and dihybrid crosses</li><li>Why test crosses are used to determine the genotype of an individual that express the dominant phenotype</li><li>Basic probability theory</li><li>When to apply the Rule of Multiplication and the Rule of Addition</li></ul><p>Performance objectives:</p><ul><li>Diagram how to use a Punnett square to determine the expected genotypes and phenotypes for a monohybrid cross</li><li>Explain the application of a test cross to determine the genotype</li><li>Discuss why it becomes more challenging to use a Punnett square as the number of characters increases</li><li>Solve genetics problems using the Rule of Multiplication and the Rule of Addition to determine the probability of expected genotypes and phenotypes&nbsp;</li></ul>
