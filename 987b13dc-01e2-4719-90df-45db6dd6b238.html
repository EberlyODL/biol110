<h2>Plants III Part 2 VoiceThread Transcript</h2><p>Slide 1</p><p>The angiosperm life cycle is similar to the gymnosperm life cycle in that it shows complete reduction of the gametophyte and the female gametophyte remains enclosed within sporophyte tissue.</p><p><br>Where gymosperms have cones - angiosperms have flowers.</p><p>The anther produces pollen while the female ovules contain an egg cell.</p><p>When the pollen lands on the stigma - fertilization can take place to produce the zygote which then grows into the embryo.</p><p>The embryo is housed within a seed and the seed is housed within fruit derived from the ovary.</p><p><br>The seeds are released from the parent plant and can then germinate to produce a new individual.</p><p>Slide 2</p><p>The process of fertilization in the angiosperms is known as double fertilization.</p><p>The pollen grain contains two haploid sperm nuclei&nbsp;</p><p>The megaspore - the female gametophyte - contains nne haploid egg nucleus and two haploid polar nuclei.</p><p>When fertilization takes place, one sperm fertilizes the egg to produce the diploid embryo.</p><p>The other sperm combines with the 2 polar nuclei to produce the triploid endosperm - this endosperm nourishes the embryo until it germinates and can begin to photosynthesize.</p><p>Slide 3</p><p>The angiosperms are divided into two groups depending on the type of seed produced.</p><p>The monocots include plants like corn and the other grasses. &nbsp;The monocots have a single embryonic seed leaf (this seed leaf is known as a cotyledon).</p><p>The dicots which include beans and other broadleaf plants have two embryonic seed leafs.</p><p>Both types of seed tend to have a significant amount of endosperm so seeds can survive in the environment until conditions are right for germination.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p>
