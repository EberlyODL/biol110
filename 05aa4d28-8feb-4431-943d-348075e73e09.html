<p>While at Columbia University in 1909, a young undergraduate student Alfred Henry Sturtevant&nbsp;took a class from Dr. Thomas H. Morgan, the famous geneticist who first described the relationship between genes and chromosomes. Sturtevant decided to continue in this line of study due to his life-long interest in genetics. Sturtevant's interest had been fostered by his work on inheritance patterns of coat color in horses; he had spent his youth tabulating the pedigrees of his father's horses and studying the passing of color traits from one generation to the next. Sturtevant approached the distinguished professor and asked for a research position in Morgan's laboratory.</p>

<p>Intrigued by Sturtevant's work on coat color inheritance (which he later encouraged Alfred to publish in the Biological Bulletin; c. 1910), Morgan offered Sturtevant a desk and research project, in what later became known as "Morgan's Fly Room." Morgan had recently begun working with a relatively new model system for genetic analysis, the fruit fly&nbsp;<em>Drosophila melanogaster</em>. Together with Calvin Bridges and H.J. Muller, Sturtevant became a member of Morgan's lab at a time when the focus of the lab was shifting away from the study of development and embryology in marine invertebrates to the genetics of&nbsp;<em>Drosophila</em>.</p>
<p>Sturtevant was fascinated by his work in the "Fly Room." Over the course of his undergraduate research he spent hours talking about inheritance with his colleagues. One night, after a lengthy discussion about a paper describing coat color inheritance in rabbits, Sturtevant deduced that genes were linked in a series. He was so energized about his idea that he stayed up late that evening constructing experiments that would later demonstrate his theory and provide the basis of linkage analysis. Sturtevant's work (as well as that of his lab mates) was a key component to the demonstration of the chromosome theory of heredity published by Morgan's group. Sturtevant continued his research as a graduate student in the lab, where he published the first&nbsp;<strong>genetic map</strong>&nbsp;of a chromosome as part of his graduate dissertation in 1913. Still, chromosome theory would not be definitively proven until after the Second World War. Sturtevant had a long career studying the genetics of fruit flies.</p>
