<p>Populations remain genetically stable if no alleles enter or leave the population. Recall, a change in allele frequencies due to interactions with outside populations is termed gene flow. If a population was fixed for one allele at a &nbsp;gene and a gamete carrying an alternative allele was able to fertilize an individual from that population, then the allele frequencies would change due to the introduction of this new allele and the population would undergo evolution. &nbsp;Migration of individuals among populations leads to&nbsp;<strong>gene flow</strong>, as individuals immigrating into the population bring new alleles, while those emigrating take alleles with them.</p>

<h2>Mutations</h2>
<p>A&nbsp;<strong>mutation</strong>&nbsp;is a change in an organism's DNA. Mutation may introduce a new allele into a population, causing small changes in the allele and genotype frequencies. Because mutations are the ultimate source of all genetic variation, &nbsp;over time they can have a significant influence on the genetic structure of the population, but the mutation rate usually is very low so it is not a strong evolutionary force. In general, , most mutations found in a population &nbsp;appear to be “neutral”, &nbsp;having little to no effect on the phenotype. Because several different combinations of nucleotides may code for the same amino acid (recall the redundancy in the genetic code), a mutation in the DNA of a protein-coding gene may &nbsp;not change the amino acid sequence of the protein. Conversely, &nbsp;some mutations &nbsp;can have a major effect on the phenotype. These mutations almost always result in a nonfunctional or less efficient product Very rarely, a mutation may result in a protein that is slightly more efficient, or that performs a new function. In order for the frequency of the mutant allele to increase as a result of natural selection, the advantage would have to be great enough to affect the individual's reproductive success. Therefore, although an assumption when applying the Hardy-Weinberg equation is that no net mutations occur, most mutations have little overall effect on the allele frequencies of a population.</p>

<h2>Random versus Nonrandom Mating</h2>
<p>Random mate selection favors genetic stability. Nonrandom mate selection often occurs in natural populations because an individual is more likely to choose a mate from his or her vicinity than from more distant areas of the population. Frequent near-neighbor matings tend to subdivide the population's gene pool into subpopulations that have less genetic diversity than the entire gene pool of the population.</p>
<p>Inbreeding (the mating of closely related individuals) was described earlier in this tutorial. Self-fertilization ("selfing") occurs when an individual fertilizes its own gametes (a common occurrence in plants). Both of these mating processes decrease the level of heterozygosity in the offspring. Normal healthy individuals can carry several or many deleterious alleles. Although each individual may carry some deleterious alleles, unrelated individuals are likely to be carriers of different harmful alleles. Therefore, most of the resulting offspring will be healthy carriers as well. If the parents are closely related, however, it is more likely that they are carrying the same deleterious alleles. Some of the recessive deleterious alleles will occur in the homozygous state, exposing the allele to selection.</p>
<p>Similarly, individuals may choose mates that have some of the same phenotypic traits (e.g., body size or height) as themselves. This is termed&nbsp;<strong>assortative mating</strong>. Although these kinds of characters are complex, involving numerous genes, they are still usually heritable. Mating of genetically similar (although not necessarily related) individuals tends to increase the amount of homozygosity in the population.&nbsp; However, nonrandom mating does not change allele frequencies because it does not include introducing new alleles into the population, or the loss of alleles.</p>

<h2 id="PopulationGeneticsandEvolution-GeneticStabilityandSelectionPressure">Genetic Stability and Selection Pressure</h2>
<p>This tutorial has focused on how &nbsp;non-adaptive changes, some due to random events, can affect allele frequencies, thus affecting the genetic stability of a population. Even deleterious alleles may increase in frequency due to chance events (recall the Tristan da Cunha example).</p>
<p>One of the &nbsp;conditions for maintaining Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium is that all individuals have the same reproductive capacity and fitness. Even minor deviations from this equality will lead to some individuals producing more offspring than others, leading to a change in allele frequencies. Any alleles that directly or indirectly affect an individual's ability to survive, mate, or reproduce may respond to selection pressure. Under strong selection pressure (e.g., when bacteria are exposed to an antibiotic), a mutation conferring some form of resistance to the antibiotic can increase in frequency in the population very quickly. In fact, antibiotic resistance is a major health concern, and both pesticide and herbicide resistance are important concerns to agriculturists. As you will learn, these examples of the evolution of resistance are a result of natural selection because the surviving, resistant individuals are better adapted to their environment.</p>
<p>Similarly, an allele that makes an individual more vulnerable to disease or predation is likely to be under very strong selection pressure and may decrease in frequency very rapidly, until it is either very rare in the population or purged completely from the gene pool.</p>
