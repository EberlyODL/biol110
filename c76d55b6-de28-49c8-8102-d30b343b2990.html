<p>The key to understanding Mendelian genetics is to understand what ratios are and how to determine them. Let's do a few exercises to insure that you are familiar with ratios.</p>
<h2 id="MendelandModernGenetics-Ratioorder">Ratio order</h2>
<p>In ratios, order means everything. In the example of Mendel's classic experiment&nbsp;following the inheritance of flower color in garden peas, the F<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;generation had a 3:1 ratio of individuals with purple to white flowers. The same results could be written as a 1:3 ratio of white to purple flowers. Therefore, the order of the traits listed within the ratio are important because the first number in the ratio is related to the first trait listed and the second number in the ratio corresponds to the second trait.</p>
<h2 id="MendelandModernGenetics-Convertingcountstoratios">Converting counts to ratios</h2>
<p>Some of Mendel's actual data for individual pea plants are listed below. Note that the ratios are obtained by dividing the larger of the two counts by the smaller.</p>
<table align="center"><caption>Data for Individual Pea Plants</caption><tbody><tr><td><p><em>Flower color</em>&nbsp;<br>Purple = 705 individuals&nbsp;<br>White = 224 individuals&nbsp;<br>705/224 = 3.15&nbsp;<br>Ratio of purple:white&nbsp;<br>flowers is 3.15:1</p></td><td><p><em>Pod shape</em>&nbsp;<br>Inflated = 882 individuals&nbsp;<br>Constricted = 299 individuals&nbsp;<br>882/299 = 2.95&nbsp;<br>Ratio of inflated:constricted&nbsp;<br>pods is 2.95:1</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

<p>An examination of the ratios listed above shows that they are all approximately a 3:1 ratio, one slightly higher and one slightly lower. The inheritance of traits is governed in some respects by probability (as you will learn in upcoming exercises), therefore, ratios are often rounded to the nearest whole number.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The relationship between ratios and fractions can be confusing. A ratio of 1:3 means that there are four "units" being considered. In other words, 1:3 does not mean 33% have one trait, while 66% have the other. Rather, 1:3 means that 25% (1 unit) have one trait and 75% (3 units) have the other. Observe the punnett square in this image&nbsp;illustrating the self-pollination of an F<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;pea plant for the character of flower color. Weâ€™ll learn more about punnett squares in the coming tutorials, just focus on the ratio versus the units.</p>
<h2 id="MendelandModernGenetics-EstimatingOffspringCountsfromRatios">Estimating Offspring Counts from Ratios</h2>
<p>Just as you can calculate ratios from counts of offspring, you can also work backwards and estimate offspring counts from ratios. Let's do an example to demonstrate.</p>
<p>You cross two true-breeding parents, one with purple flowers and one with white flowers, plant the seeds produced, grow the F<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;generation an allow the plants to self-pollinate, and then count the number of offspring (the F<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;generation) with purple and white flowers. If you counted 1,000 offspring and there was a 3:1 ratio of purple:white flowers, how many offspring would have purple flowers? How many would have white flowers?</p>
<p>Pull out a piece of paper and pencil (and/or your calculator) to see if you can get the right answer before viewing the solution in the next section.</p>
<h2 id="MendelandModernGenetics-RatioProblemSolution">Ratio Problem Solution</h2>
<p><em>n</em>&nbsp;= total number of offspring = 1,000<br>3:1 ratio = total of 4 "units" (3 + 1 = 4)<br><sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub>&nbsp;of units have purple flowers,&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub>&nbsp;have white flowers (Recall, there was a 3:1 ratio of purple:white flowers.)<br><sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub>&nbsp;= 75%,&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub>&nbsp;= 25%<br>75% purple flowers, 25% white flowers<br>Convert to decimal equivalent: 0.75 purple flowers, 0.25 white flowers<br>Numbers =&nbsp;<em>n</em>&nbsp;X 0.75 for purple,&nbsp;<em>n</em>&nbsp;X 0.25 for white<br>purple = 1,000 X 0.75 = 750, white = 1,000 X 0.25 = 250</p>
<p>Estimate = 750 offspring with purple flowers, 250 with white flowers</p>
