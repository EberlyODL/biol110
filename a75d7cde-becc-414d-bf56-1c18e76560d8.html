<p>This tutorial continued our discussion of prokaryotes by introducing their cell walls, various means of locomotion, and nutritional modes. Prokaryotes have a number of modifications to their walls. The gram-positive bacteria have walls rich in peptidoglycans (a class of molecule derived from sugars and proteins). Gram-negative bacteria have a double-walled character and do not have a great deal of peptidoglycans (which is why they do not stain well with Gram's stain). On the other hand, the gram-negative bacteria are often rich in lipopolysaccharides (a class of molecules derived from lipids and sugars), which can be toxic to other life forms; many bacterial toxins belong to this class of molecules. An additional sticky capsule (and/or pili) may be present, which help some bacteria adhere to various substrates.</p>
<p>In addition to modifications to their walls, a variety of prokaryotes have the capability of moving about their environment. This movement is not random, but rather, can be governed by the presence of various molecules in the environment. Some bacteria can detect the presence of nutrients, and they move toward a high concentration of a particular carbon source in a process generally referred to as chemotaxis.</p>
<p>This tutorial presented the diversity of prokaryotic nutritional modes and carbon sources. Bacteria can use simple sugars, as well as complex sources of carbon. Some bacteria can live off oil, and some can decompose cellulose. The ability to breakdown complex carbon sources has been utilized for a variety of purposes. The field of bioremediation is based, to a large extent, on the use of bacteria that can breakdown harmful compounds that have been introduced into the environment from various industrial and agricultural sources. For example, bacteria are capable of breaking down TNT and PCBs.</p>
<p>Most prokaryotes are very sensitive to their environment and can alter their behavior in response to changing conditions. For example, most species of&nbsp;<em>Bacillus</em>&nbsp;can form hardy spores in response to stressful conditions. These spores have low metabolic activity, can survive extreme conditions (e.g., boiling water) and are long-lived.</p>
<p>The next tutorial will discuss the ecological significance of various types of prokaryotes and the evolution of this group.</p>
