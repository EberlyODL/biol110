<p>Even though climate change and the media coverage surrounding it can appear overwhelming, there are a number of ways you can take direct action to make your home and lifestyle more environmentally friendly and to reduce your personal carbon footprint. A carbon footprint is a measure of the amount of greenhouse gas (or carbon dioxide equivalent) that is produced from our daily activities over the course of a year.</p>

<h2>Take Action: Emissions Calculator</h2>
<p>Be pro-active and use the following <a class="ext" href="http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/emissions/ind_calculator.html" target="_blank">online emissions calculator</a> to get a rough estimate of your personal or family&#39;s greenhouse gas emissions and explore the impact of taking various actions to reduce your emissions. If you do not have access to this type of data from home, try the sample data provided below.</p>

<p>Changing your behavior in small areas can help to have a personal impact on climate change.</p>
<h3>Module 8 Assessment Notes</h3>
<p>Using the Module 8 assessment in ANGEL, Question 1 explores whether the warming that the Earth is currently exploring is due to natural (increased solar irradiation) or human (increased atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations due to industrialization) causes.&nbsp; Question 2 focuses on one of the possible impacts of climate change (ocean acidification) and uses real scientific data to explore some of the possible effects of ocean acidification on coral reefs.&nbsp; Finally, Question 3 uses media articles to assess some of the potential impacts of climate change.</p>
<h3>Module 8 Wrap Up</h3>
<p>You have just finished Module 8. Not only will you put your new scientific information and skills to good use to explore a topic that will feature as a major part of your lives over the coming years, but hopefully you have a better understanding of how your actions can be directly related to some of the issues raised. If you have any questions, please email the instructor via ANGEL. Alternatively, if there is anything in this module that you would like to comment on, or add to, please visit the "Course Feedback" link in the top menu.</p>
