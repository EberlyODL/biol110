<p id="AntiquityofLife-IntroductionandLearningObjectives"><strong>Introduction and Learning Objectives</strong></p>
<p>This tutorial will address evolution on a broad scale by looking at biological diversity in the context of a changing planet, and discusses how we determine the dates of events in Earthâ€™s history. As you will learn, Earth's environment has changed dramatically in the 4.5 billion years since it was formed.</p>
<p>By the end of this tutorial you should have a basic understanding of:</p>
<ul><li>The age of the universe, the solar system, and Earth</li><li>The differences between the environment of the early Earth and Earth today</li><li>The chemical evolution of life</li><li>The dynamic structure of Earth</li><li>The geologic time scale</li><li>The distinction between relative and absolute dating methods</li><li>The basic principles behind radiometric dating and dendrochronology</li><li>The three main branches of the tree of life</li></ul>
<p>Performance objectives:</p>
<ul><li>Know the age of Earth and explain how this has been determined</li><li>Describe the conditions on early Earth and their effect of on the evolution of life</li><li>Understand the difference between relative and absolute dating methods</li><li>Be able to determine the half life of a fossil based upon radiometric dating info</li><li>Name the three domains of life and describe the primary difference between prokaryotes and eukaryotes</li></ul>
