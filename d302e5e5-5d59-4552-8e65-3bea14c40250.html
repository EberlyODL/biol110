<p>The deuterostomes include the echinoderms and the chordates. The echinoderms are an exclusively marine group that show five-fold radial symmetry as adult, but are bilaterally symmetrical as larvae. They have an endoskeleton and are covered with a spiny skin.&nbsp; They have a complex water vascular system that hydraulically powers their movement using tube feet.

The Phylum Chordata contains the subphyla Urochordata, Cephalochordata, and Vertebrata. Individuals within the phylum all have a notochord, a dorsal nerve cord, pharyngeal slits, and a postanal tail. The notochord may or may not persist in the adult, and the pharyngeal slits are modified in various ways in the different groups. The Urochordates are the probable ancestors of vertebrates. Vertebrates have a dorsal nerve cord that is protected by a vertebral column, and the anterior portion of this nerve cord is protected by a cranium.

There are several basal features found in vertebrates, and they are used to distinguish the lineages. The presence or absence of jaws, teeth, lungs, legs, amniotic eggs, and hair are more derived features that arose in succession, and they give the vertebrates the diversity seen today, including our own species.
