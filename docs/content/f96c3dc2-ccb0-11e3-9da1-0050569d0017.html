<p>Plants and pollinators have co-evolved physical characteristics that make them more likely to interact successfully, which has, in turn, led to the great diversity of flowers in nature. The plants benefit from attracting a particular type of pollinator to its flower, ensuring that its pollen will be carried to another flower of the same species and hopefully resulting in successful reproduction.</p>
<p>Plants and pollinators do not have the same goals. Plants want to maximize the spread of pollen to new individuals, while at the same time minimize the energetic costs of producing pollen and nectar to attract pollinator vectors. Pollinators, on the other hand, want to maximize energetic rewards of high quality food in the form of proteinaceous pollen and sugary nectar, while at the same time minimize the cost of foraging. These seemingly antagonistic goals can result in highly specialized relationships between plant and pollinator symbionts.</p>
<p>Some of the pollinators that you may have learned about include:</p>
<p>While this may seem familiar to you now, it probably brings up the age-old question from most of your school science classes: Why do I care?</p>
<h2>Video: Why care about Bees?</h2>
<p>Who cares about bees? Their stings are painful and less bees would be a good thing. Or would it? Watch this video to learn more:</p>
