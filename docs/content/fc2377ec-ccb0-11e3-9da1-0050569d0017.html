<p>Remember that the first step of hypothesis testing is to convert the research question into null and alternative hypotheses. The null hypothesis is a claim of "no difference," whereas the alternative hypothesis is a claim of "a difference in the population."</p>
<p>One of the surprising things about science is that it&#39;s actually almost impossible to prove anything true. Instead, all you do is show that things are false. So instead of proving your hypothesis, you just try to prove that all of the alternatives are wrong.</p>
<p>To do this, you need to use inferential statistics to calculate a test statistic from the data. The test statistic is then converted to a conditional probability called a p-value (p = probability).</p>

<p>While 95% is generally acceptable in biological research, medical research generally uses a 99% (or 0.01) probability value, where the risk of getting a result by chance is only 1 out of 100. It is not too difficult to see why this is the case when you are dealing with potential fatal disease diagnoses and treatments etc.</p>
