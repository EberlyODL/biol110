<p>Remember that the raw data is usually a spreadsheet that consists of a lot of numbers. This raw data does not tell you anything about the effect you may be trying to test and therefore cannot be used to test your hypotheses in the raw form.</p>
<p>In much the same way, when graphs are used as a visual display of hypothesis testing, a plot of the raw data is going to be equally as meaningless as the raw data table.</p>
<p>However, you are now experts at summarizing the raw data by calculating Means to get an &#39;average&#39; and Standard Deviations to assess the &#39;variability.&#39; If you have more than a single measurement for a variable, then the Means and Standard Deviations are also the most effective metrics to use when plotting your results.</p>
