<p><b>Project Requirements</b><br />
	<br />
	The requirements of the project are that you use the scientific method to:</p>
<ol>
	<li>ask an interesting and topical biological question</li>
	<li>generate the appropriate Null and Alternative hypothesis</li>
	<li>gather the appropriate information from reliable sources to test your hypotheses</li>
	<li>use supporting evidence to provide conclusions on your research findings as well as any future studies or recommendations that you think are important or necessary</li>
</ol>
<p><i><b>Additional Project Requirements:</b></i></p>
<ul>
	<li>The steps of the scientific method need to be followed in the correct and logical order.</li>
	<li>The VoiceThread needs to be limited to less than five minutes.</li>
	<li>The text and graphics need to be of sufficient size and quality to be visible on the VoiceThread format.</li>
	<li>Use at least five &#39;good quality&#39; reliable references. View the <a assets/referencing.pdf" target="_">Guide to Referencing</a>.</li>
	<li>Follow the <span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-file" style="display: inline;"><a assets/module_10_project_tips.pdf" target="_">Project Tips</a></span>.</li>
</ul>
<p><b><i>VoiceThread Requirements:</i></b></p>
<ol>
	<li>Title - should be catchy yet informative. Also a good place to introduce yourself.</li>
	<li>Introduction - provide background information and research question.</li>
	<li>Hypothesis - Null and Alternative hypotheses stated.</li>
	<li>Data Gathered - akin to research methods whereby the data you gathered is summarized and presented in words, tables, graphs, graphics etc.</li>
	<li>Conclusion - whether hypotheses were accepted or rejected, why, and what the data is saying.&nbsp; Include other interesting findings you uncovered during your research or other relating information.</li>
	<li>Reference list</li>
</ol>
<p><b>Grading Rubric</b><br />
	<br />
	The TAs will be using the <span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-file" style="display: inline;"><a assets/module_10_rubric_for_students.pdf" target="_">Module 10 Rubric for Students</a></span> to grade your VoiceThread projects. The TAs will place a &radic; or X alongside each point and then give you a grade for each of the 8 different sections highlighted in gray. The composite of these 8 subsections will form the final total score.</p>
