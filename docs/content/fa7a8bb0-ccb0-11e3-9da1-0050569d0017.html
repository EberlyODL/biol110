<p>Once an experiment (or survey) is conducted, the results are recorded in their raw form - e.g. each measure per individual is recorded. The end result usually would be a spreadsheet, which consists of a lot of numbers. However, this raw data does not tell you anything about the effect you may be trying to test, and therefore cannot be used to test your hypotheses in the raw form.</p>
<h4>VoiceThread: Averages</h4>
<p>Let&#39;s illustrate this using an example that you are no doubt very familiar with--exams and&nbsp;anxiety (stress).</p>

<h4>Self-Check: Averages</h4>

<h4>Sample Size and Sample Mean</h4>
<p>Sample means are sensitive to extreme values, so a single data point can make a noticeable change in the sample mean--especially if the sample size is small. Remember that the primary point of sampling is to create a small group from a population that is as similar to the larger population as possible. Ultimately, you want the sample Mean (X) to approximate the population Mean (m).</p>
<h5>Interactive Exercise: Impact of Sample Size on Sample Mean</h5>
<p>Try this exercise where you can enter different sample sizes to see how the sample mean differs from the population mean depending on sample size.</p>

<p>You should notice that the calculated sample means get closer to the actual population mean as the sample size increases. Based on the normal probability, the more samples that are taken will increase the number of values that are closer to the population mean and the effect of the outlier values will be reduced accordingly.</p>
