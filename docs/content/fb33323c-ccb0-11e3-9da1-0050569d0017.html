<p>Up until now, you have been using descriptive statistics and simple graphical representations. In effect you have been taking a set of data and finding the best way to describe, summarize, and display it--considering both individual variables, and relationships among variables.</p>
<p>However, while this information can be used to draw some initial conclusions, it does not allow you to make a definitive test of your hypotheses--which is the cornerstone of scientific discovery.</p>

<p>While descriptive statistics and graphs are great to summarize the data and get a sense for what it is showing, in most cases, inferential statistics are used to actually test the hypothesis. In effect, inferential statistics are the science of extrapolating the results of a study to make claims about the larger population, i.e. procedures that allow us to decide whether our sample is representative of the population or not, and as such, allows us to make accurate inferences about the population represented in our samples (e.g. the US university student population in the &#39;Party School&#39; example and the adult US population in the &#39;Fast Food and Obesity&#39; example).</p>
<p>Inferential statistics are used to make generalizations from a sample to a population. In any study where the entire population is not sampled, there are two sources of error that may result in a sample mean being different from (not representative of) the population mean from which it is drawn:</p>
<h4>Sample bias:</h4>
<ul>
	<li>There is the possibility that some of the experimental subjects may consciously or unconsciously model their behavior based on what they think the researcher expects from them.</li>
	<li>The researcher may make consistent errors in the measurements and evaluation of the results.</li>
</ul>
<p>This bias is the result of a poorly designed experiment and can be easily overcome by designing what is called a blind experiment where the subjects and researcher/measurement taker are not aware of who is in the experimental or in the control group. It is important to have a sound experimental design before the data is generated because once the experiment begins there is no way to reverse the design without staring over again.</p>
<h4>Sampling error</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Introduced by chance - i.e. a random error.</li>
</ul>
<p>Inferential statistics do not take into account sample bias as it is a research design issue. Rather, inferential statistics only take into account sampling error, i.e. address random error (chance). This is why it is important to have a good experimental design if you want to have confidence in your hypothesis testing.</p>
