<p style="text-align: left;">Use these guidelines whenever you are preparing a scientific document. Conciseness is just as important as completeness and accuracy.</p>
<ol>
	<li>Avoid the use of pronouns: I, you, he, she, they, them, our, your, it, and so forth.</li>
	<li>Write in complete sentences.</li>
	<li>Paginate&nbsp;your work, even if it consists of a single page.</li>
	<li>Be sure to put your name in the page header or footer, starting with page 2.</li>
	<li>Express temperature in degrees Celsius rather than degrees Fahrenheit.&nbsp; For example, the normal temperature of the human body is 37&deg;, not 98.6&deg;.</li>
	<li>Be certain to cite the source of any data or idea that is not your own.</li>
	<li>Do not repeat the same idea. Write it once, and then move onto the next thought.</li>
	<li>Be concise and to the point. Scientific writing is not an exercise in creative writing. Also, be sure your work is free of &ldquo;science fiction.&rdquo;</li>
	<li>Be sure to check your written work for typographical and grammatical errors before handing it in. Nothing detracts from the quality of written work like errors in spelling, punctuation, and sentence structure.</li>
	<li>Consider having someone proofread your paper before submitting it. Often, another set of eyes can detect problems that may have been missed due to fatigue.</li>
