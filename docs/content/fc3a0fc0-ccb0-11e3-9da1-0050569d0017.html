<p>An understanding of the scientific method is a good start because learning about science (and its role in society) without learning the process of science is like trying to learn a foreign language with a dictionary as opposed to taking classes.</p>
<h4>Video: Scientific Method</h4>
<p>The scientific method is not a scary technical term, but rather, it is a process of discovery that provides a useful approach to understanding the world. <strong><em>Right click on the video below and select &#39;Play" to learn more about the scientific method</em></strong>.<object data="https://online.science.psu.edu/sites/default/files/biol110/sm_wheel.swf" height="480" hspace="20" vspace="20" width="640"><param name="quality" value="high" /><param name="movie" value="https://online.science.psu.edu/sites/default/files/biol110/sm_wheel.swf" /><embed height="480" hspace="20" quality="high" src="assets/sm_wheel.swf" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" vspace="20" width="640"></embed></object></p>
<h5>The four basic steps in the scientific method therefore are:</h5>
<ol>
	<li>Make an observation</li>
	<li>Formulate a hypothesis</li>
	<li>Conduct a critical experiment</li>
	<li>Draw conclusions and make revisions</li>
</ol>
<p>The steps in the method will first be introduced in their generic form and then then reinforced through a worked example.</p>
<h4>1. Make an observation</h4>
<p>A scientific study always begins with an observation. In effect, you are looking for interesting patterns or cause‐and-effect relationships. In effect, you will generate an interesting question, or set of questions, which will serve as the starting point of your discovery.</p>
<h4>2. Formulate hypothesis</h4>
<p>You have no doubt all come up with a &#39;theory&#39; about something from time to time. For example you may have a &#39;theory that the traffic to university is less if you wake up late.&#39; Unfortunately, the word &#39;theory&#39; is often used to refer to a guess or speculation, whereas in science, a theory is the complete opposite - i.e. something of undeniable certainty - e.g. all organisms are composed of cells. So when you use the word &#39;theory,&#39; what you are in effect really meaning is a hypothesis.</p>
<p>Based on observations, the next step is to develop a hypothesis, or a proposed explanation for observed phenomena. The important thing about a hypothesis is that it needs to be:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Testable</strong> - the validity of a hypothesis can only be evaluated by putting it to the test.</li>
	<li><strong>Falsifiable</strong> - a hypothesis must be stated in such a way that you can imagine an observation that would prove it untrue (false).</li>
	<li>It is also important to realize that it is impossible to prove that a hypothesis is absolutely true, as future evidence, when it becomes available, may show that it is not true. As such, hypotheses are generally posed as a negative statement where there is no relationship between two factors.</li>
</ul>
<p>A hypothesis that states no relationship is termed a Null hypothesis, which can be disproved by any observation that contradicts it.</p>
<p>While the use of a null hypothesis does seem to make some sense, it does raise the problem of what if you do find an effect. This is a valid question that can easily be overcome by stating an Alternative hypothesis, where the converse of the null is stated, and therefore gives you something to accept if you reject the Null hypothesis. It is important to remember that the Alternative hypothesis never makes any predictive statements--it merely states that there is an effect, but not what that effect is.</p>
<h5>So in summary,</h5>
<ul>
	<li>Null hypothesis: states that there is no effect.</li>
	<li>Alternative hypothesis: states that there is an effect, but not what the effect is.</li>
</ul>
<h4>3. Conduct a critical experiment</h4>
<p>One of the most effective ways to test a hypothesis is through some form of experimentation. The information that is collected from the experiments is called data. It is this data that is used to actually test the hypothesis (i.e. do I reject or accept my hypothesis?).</p>
<p>Experiments in their most basic form help you determine the cause‐and‐effect relationship between two things. The information that is collected during the experimental (data gathering) process provides the information that you use to formulate a conclusion. In your daily lives, you may not actually be conducting critical experiments, but accessing and sorting through information from multiple sources to generate a conclusion is akin to the experimental process of a scientist.</p>
<h4>4. Draw conclusions and make revisions</h4>
<p>Once you have the results from the experiment (or information you have gathered from sources), you need to examine and analyze them. This entails looking for patterns and relationships from the data gathered in the experiments. From these, conclusions are drawn to see whether the findings support the hypothesis.</p>
<p>Science is a fluid process that involves a lot of trial and error over time, so if your conclusions do not support your hypothesis, then you can revise your hypothesis, and start the experimental process again - i.e. revise and start again. &nbsp;This is the cornerstone of scientific discovery because it requires an open mind and the ability to change what you think.</p>
