<p>We live in a technology-driven world and it would be hard to imagine a world without cell phones, i‚Äêpods, antibiotics, a criminal justice system, and food on our tables, just to name a few. You only need to open a newspaper, or turn on the TV and you will be inundated with topics such as:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Climate change</li>
	<li>Species extinction</li>
	<li>Nutrition and health</li>
	<li>Pandemics</li>
	<li>Cloning</li>
	<li>Stem cells</li>
</ul>

	Many of us don&#39;t value science as much as we should. However, science lives beneath the surface of everything we touch and taste. It is the key to our prosperity, one of the driving forces of our economy, and it creates hundreds of thousands of jobs.<br />

	Despite the fact that science is, and will continue to be, part of our daily lives, statistics from Michigan State University report that in 2007 only 28% of American adults qualify as scientifically literate.<br />
