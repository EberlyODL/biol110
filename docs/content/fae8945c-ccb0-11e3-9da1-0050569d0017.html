<p><b>Learning the process of science cannot be done overnight. Rather, just like a plumber or a carpenter has a toolbox full of the tools needed for their trade to get the job done, we will methodically gather the scientific tools needed to place in our scientific toolbox so that we can better understand the process of science, assess science in the media, and make informed conclusions and decisions based on the information presented.</b></p>
