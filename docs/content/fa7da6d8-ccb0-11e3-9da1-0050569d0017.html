<p>Throughout the semester, you have been introduced to science. As such, you should now have a better understanding of the scientific method, how science works, and how it is portrayed in the media. In doing so, you are now well on your way to biological literacy, and perhaps unbeknown to you, you have successfully generated hypotheses, collated and analyzed data, as well as drawn conclusions from the information presented. You are now prepared to head out into the world and put your scientific abilities to the test.</p>
<p>The remaining three modules differ in structure from the modules completed so far. Rather than containing content followed by an assessment at the end, Modules 8 and 9 are totally assessment-based. They use assessment questions containing information, data, and media articles as a launchpad to not only test your new scientific knowledge but to learn more about the topics of climate change and pandemics (topics which have been at the forefront of our daily lives over the past couple of years). Finally, Module 10 is a group project that runs over a few weeks where you have the creative freedom to pick a topic of your choice, gather information, and produce a VoiceThread presentation as the assessment outcome.</p>
<h2>What is climate change and global warming?</h2>
<p>Climate change is a broad term that refers to long-term changes in climate, including average temperature and rainfall change. Global warming is the gradual increase of the Earth&#39;s average surface temperature.</p>
<p>During the past 100 years, global average surface temperatures have increased by .9&deg;C (<a class="ext" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_average_surface_temperature" target="_blank">read more about temperature record</a> - if you click on the graph on the wikipedia page, you will see a detailed and referenced description of how the graph was produced). The terms &#39;global warming&#39; and &#39;climate change&#39; are often used interchangeably. As a consequence of this and future heating, climate change has been suggested to be one of the greatest social, economic and environmental challenges of our time.</p>
<p>The potential impacts of climate change include temperature increases, sea-level rises, melting of the polar ice-caps, changed weather patterns (droughts and floods), and increased sea temperatures among others. If true, not only will these have an impact on species and ecosystems, but they will have a profound effect on our current way of life.</p>

<h2>What is causing the warming?</h2>
<p>What is known for sure is that the incoming energy from the sun in the form of solar radiation passes through the atmosphere and heats the earth&#39;s surface. Approximately 50% of the solar energy directed at the earth is directly absorbed at the surface, and the remaining 50% is reflected and radiated back into space in the form of infrared radiation. However, a proportion (22%) of the reflected infrared radiation is trapped by some atmospheric gases (called greenhouse gases), which results in maintaining the Earth&#39;s temperature at a level necessary to support life (<a class="ext" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_effect" target="_blank">additional information on the greenhouse effect</a>). The problem we now face is that there is an increasing amount of greenhouse gases (including methane and carbon dioxide) in the atmosphere that trap heat--the so-called greenhouse effect--whereby less heat is escaping and more heat is being trapped within the atmosphere.</p>
<h2>Video: Man-made or natural?</h2>

<p>Thus, one of the big questions that we are constantly faced with in the media is whether the warming we are experiencing is a natural phenomenon or whether it is due to human influences. There are many Web sites and media outlets out there that portray different points of view on this subject, but if you are interested in more information, <a class="ext" href="http://www.globalissues.org/article/233/climate-change-and-global-warming-introduction" target="_blank">Global Issues</a> provides a brief introduction on global warming from both a social and environmental perspective, and <a class="ext" href="http://www.skepticalscience.com/argument.php" target="_blank">Skeptical Science</a> provides a useful synthesis and references to both sides of the global warming debate.</p>
<p>This module explores some of the concerns of the climate change debate. At the conclusion of Lesson 2, you will be required to use your new found scientific logic and problem solving abilities to test some of the potential causes and impacts of increasing global temperatures.</p>
