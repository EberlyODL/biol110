		<h2>Case Study 6A</h2>
		<h6>At this point, is this academic dishonesty? If so, what kind (plagiarism, cheating, etc.) and why?</h6>
		<p><strong>Response 1: </strong><em>At this point I would say this behavior shows poor judgment on Diane&#39;s part, but is not academic dishonesty. It would have been better for Jack to go to the instructor, explain his circumstances, and see if it would be possible to get an extension.</em></p>
		<p><strong>Response 2:</strong><em> I think not, because Diane is showing an example of what she did. In the business world, looking at other examples is called "benchmarking", but can lead to plagiarism if the author is not careful.</em></p>
		<p><strong>Response 3: </strong><em>No, at this point this is only collaboration. The work of other students, shared by consent, is not plagiarism.&nbsp; What Jack does with this information is what will constitute plagiarism, or not. He can read her material to see how she structured things, but when he applies himself to doing the assignment he must make sure his own work is original within the specifications of the assignment (she may have used formulas or guidelines preset by the instructor, which are fine to reproduce, but the content itself should reflect Jack&#39;s own analysis). Here I would recommend that Jack communicate with the professor to see if he can get an extension so he can do a proper job on the analysis. I would also recommend that Jack not use her paper as a reference while he is completing his assignment. It&#39;s okay to read it once or twice, but it&#39;s better used as a form of research, not a firm guideline to follow. If he were to follow her structure very closely, even though he might choose different words, this would constitute a form of plagiarism in that the work would not be completely his own.</em></p>

		<h6>At this point, is this academic dishonesty? If so, what kind and why?</h6>
		<p><strong>Response 1: </strong><em>Yes, this is academic dishonesty. Jack is using Diane&#39;s work and presenting it as his own. </em></p>
		<p><strong>Response 2:</strong><em> This is done in the business world sometimes, but should be avoided in courses. Because Jack is using Diane&#39;s paper as a reference, he has not done his own analysis from scratch. In copyright terms, he is creating a "derivative product" and would need Diane&#39;s permission to do so. In academic terms, it will likely cause him problems because he has NOT done the analysis from scratch. In addition, since this will be based on Diane&#39;s writing style and organization, the document will more than likely resemble Diane&#39;s.</em></p>
		<p><strong>Response 3: </strong><em>Yes, this is academic dishonesty. Jack is bypassing most of the procedures involved in creating an original work and is simply rephrasing parts of Diane&#39;s work. This is clearly not his own work, and constitutes plagiarism.</em></p>

				<h6>If you were Diane, how could you explain your role in what transpired?</h6>
				<p><strong>Response 1: </strong><em>By now Diane probably recognized that she put her own academic integrity at risk when she gave her paper to Jack as a reference, although she didn&#39;t intend for him to copy her work. Diane needs to be honest about what she did even though it makes her look like an accomplice.</em></p>
				<p><strong>Response 2:</strong> <em>Diane is in a very tough situation. She probably had the best of intentions when sharing her paper, but look at the trouble Jack caused. If this is a first time incident, and she has the e-mails saved, it will help Prof. Mellencamp understand what her intentions were. In the future, Diane might think about sharing general research hints with her friends rather than a finished document. </em></p>
				<p><strong>Response 3: </strong><em>Diane should not necessarily be blamed for sharing her work. Very often, in the workforce, people review material that covers similar subject matter so that they can create original work without "reinventing the wheel" or covering material that has already been detailed. They can get good ideas about what works and what does not work in the final presentation of material. However, it is important with each new project or assignment (whether academic or real-world) to start fresh and customize material each time. Customizing material takes a lot more work than just changing a few words. It takes additional research, as well as rethinking the material and presenting it so that original thoughts, ideas, facts, etc. are conveyed properly. If I were Diane and wanted to show my work to another student I would probably meet them for a little while and let them look over a hardcopy, then take it with me when I left. This way a person can get help, maybe ask some questions, talk over their ideas, but not actually sit down and copy someone else&#39;s work. There is value in collaboration, but it is important for people sharing their own work to take some protective measures.</em></p>
