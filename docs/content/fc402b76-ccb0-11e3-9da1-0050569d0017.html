<p>If you cast your minds back, you will remember that there are three types of data that have been spoken about--binary, categorical, and continuous. There are different inferential statistical tests for each of the data types.</p>
<p>Statistical tests do not have to be difficult. All of the tests you will do follow simple mathematical equations that you should be comfortable with. For continuous data, they simply use the information that goes into the Mean and the Standard Deviation, of which you are now experts.</p>
<h3>t-test (continuous data)</h3>
<p>Most biological data is continuous data, and a t-test is the simplest and most common statistical procedure used for comparing or contrasting Means from only two groups (think "t for two").</p>
<p>Up until now you have been working with a few different studies that would be appropriate for a t-test:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The &#39;Fast Food and Obesity&#39; study</li>
	<li>The &#39;Exams and Anxiety&#39; study</li>
</ul>
<p>While both of these studies are comparing two means, there is a fundamental difference in these two studies.</p>
<ul>
	<li>The &#39;Fast Food and Obesity&#39; study has two <b>independent</b> groups--a treatment group and a control group. The individuals in each of these two groups are not the same.</li>
	<li>The &#39;Exams and Anxiety&#39; study on the other hand uses measurements from the same individuals--a normal and exam day measurement. The individuals in each of the two groups are the same, and therefore, the results are <b>dependent</b> on each other.</li>
</ul>
<p>Given these differences, there are two types of t-tests depending on the type of study.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Independent (unpaired) t-test</li>
	<li>Dependent (paired) t-test</li>
</ul>
<p>While the underlying mechanics are the same, they use different formulas.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s use these studies as worked examples to show how to perform a t-test, and hence see how p-values are calculated and used in hypothesis testing.</p>
