<h3>Course Description</h3>
<p>The goal of this course is to introduce you to fundamental concepts that are common to all organisms and to explore the biological diversity of life on Earth.</p>
<h3>Tentative Schedule</h3>
<p>There will be weekly online quizzes and homework assignments. The syllabus is posted on ANGEL.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Course Requirements</h3>
<p>One of the most important requirements is that students are responsible for reading and understanding all information regarding the conduct of the course. Read the important introductory documents, found under the lessons tab, first to reduce confusion later on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Inevitably someone will email asking for information that will be easily found in these documents. You will simply be directed to read them again, (and it&#39;s not permitted to be annoyed by this). It just makes sense to read the information right at the beginning of the course and refer to it later on.</p>
<h3>Course Prerequisites</h3>
<p>There are no prerequisites for this course.</p>
