<h2>Will sub-sampling not provide a biased estimate of the population?</h2>
<p>To answer this you need to step back and look at populations in nature. In nature, most populations have what is called a <b>normal distribution</b>. Put simply, it turns out that middle values tend to occur more frequently, with outliers, or extreme values, occurring less frequently. This is why you don&#39;t see basketball player-sized people as frequently as you see average height individuals. Let&#39;s illustrate what we mean by looking at the distribution of IQ scores in a population.</p>

<p>So, in theory, if you take enough individuals in your sample, you should get more of the middle values, and therefore, a result that resembles that of the population. The million-dollar question, however, is how many is enough for the sample to be representative of the population?</p>
<p>Now that you are more familiar with the difference between a sample and a population, you can start to address this question.</p>
<p>Returning to the &#39;Party School&#39; example. If there are an estimated 14 million students in US universities, 122,000 represents just less than 1% of the US university population. Moreover, on average, there were 325 respondents to the survey per school, which in Penn State&#39;s case amounts to less than 1% of the University Park campus&#39; enrollment of 43,000 students.</p>
<p>Based on this information, would you consider the sample size to be sufficient to draw a definitive conclusion?</p>
<p>While you may like to say yes (due to the pride of going to the top party school), I am sure you will agree that a sample of less than 1% of the population may not be adequate in this case.</p>
<p>So if you are going to enjoy wearing this new party badge, keep in mind the actual validity behind the results.</p>
<p>It is therefore important to keep in mind that the primary point of sampling is to create a small group from a population that is as similar to the larger population as possible. In essence, you want to have a little group that is like the big group. With that in mind, one of the features you look for in a sample is the degree of representativeness--how well does the sample represent the larger population from which it was drawn?</p>
