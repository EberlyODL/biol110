<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Terms</h2> <p style="text-align: justify;">You should have a working knowledge of the following terms:</p> <div class="table-wrap" style="text-align: justify;"><table class="confluenceTable" border="0"><tbody><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><ul><li>allele</li><li>asexual reproduction</li><li>chromosome</li><li>clone</li><li>crossing over</li><li>diploid cell</li><li>fertilization</li><li>gamete</li><li>gene</li><li>haploid cell</li></ul></td> <td class="confluenceTd"><ul><li>homologous chromosomes</li><li>independent assortment</li><li>life cycle</li><li>meiosis</li><li>nonsister chromatid</li><li>recombination</li><li>sexual reproduction</li><li>sister chromatid</li><li>zygote</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table></div> <h2 style="text-align: justify;">Introduction and Goals</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">It has long been noted that offspring resemble their parents in many  ways, and that many traits are passed from one generation to the next.  This is evident in the physical similarities of siblings, and in  offspring and their parents. Although there are definite similarities  between parents and offspring (and between offspring), there also is  variation. After all, children never look entirely like either of their  parents because they have inherited traits from both parents. Variation  between generations is an important feature of natural selection because  it provides the genetic basis of differential reproductive success.  This tutorial will examine how chromosomes are passed from parents to  offspring, and how this process gives rise to genetic variation in  offspring. By the end of this tutorial you should be familiar with:</p> <ul style="text-align: justify;"><li>Asexual and sexual reproduction</li><li>Sexual life cycles</li><li>Meiosis</li><li>The two sources of genetic variation during meiosis</li></ul><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Types of Reproduction</h2><div style="text-align: justify;"><p>Organisms reproduce in <a class="highslide" href="/sites/onlinecourses.science.psu.edu.bio110/files/u4/Tutorial2_Figure%201%20Binary%20Fission.jpg" onclick="return hs.expand(this)"> <img alt="Tutorial 2 Figure 1. Binary Fission" src="https://onlinecourses.science.psu.edu/bio110/sites/onlinecourses.science.psu.edu.bio110/files/u4/Tutorial2_Figure%201%20Binary%20Fission.jpg" style="float: right; height: 150px; width: 170px; margin: 10px;"> </a>one of two general ways: asexually or sexually. In <strong>asexual reproduction</strong> individuals (e.g., bacteria, <a href="http://www.micrographia.com/specbiol/cnidari/hydrozo/hydr0100/hydra-00.htm" target="_blank" title="Hydra"><span class="external-link">Hydra</span></a>) produce genetically identical offspring termed <strong>clones</strong>. For example, many plants can be cloned by vegetative propagation of root and stem cuttings.</p></div><p style="text-align: justify;">Asexual reproduction is sometimes advantageous to organisms because  it is generally quick and requires less energy. The major disadvantage  of asexual reproduction is that offspring are genetically identical to  the parent, and this lack of genetic variation may be detrimental if  conditions change and genetic diversity becomes valuable. This situation  could occur with the introduction of a new disease or predator,  changing environmental conditions, or other factors.</p> <p style="text-align: justify;">In <strong>sexual reproduction</strong> the genetic material from two parents  combines to form offspring who are genetically distinct from their  parents (and who are also distinct from other siblings produced by the  same parents). Even though sexual reproduction requires more energy and  time than asexual reproduction, it provides offspring with a unique  genetic makeup that may provide them with a selective advantage in an  unpredictable environment. The key to understanding how this genetic  variation is maintained lies in examining the behavior of chromosomes  during the sexual <strong>life cycle</strong>.</p> <p style="text-align: justify;">In many of the organisms we will discuss, the exchange (or  recombination) of genetic information is obligatorily coupled to  reproduction, which is why such an organism is characterized as  undergoing sexual reproduction. However, the exchange (or recombination)  of genetic information is not always coupled to reproduction. For  example, conjugation in bacteria can be accompanied by a brief exchange  of genetic material without division; so, bacteria can engage in a form  of sex (i.e., exchange of genetic material) known as conjugation and  also undergo asexual reproduction (binary fission). Sex and reproduction  are not always linked.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Chromosomes<a class="highslide" href="/sites/onlinecourses.science.psu.edu.bio110/files/u4/Tutorial2_Chromosome_0.jpg" onclick="return hs.expand(this)"><img alt="Chromosome Breakdown" src="https://onlinecourses.science.psu.edu/bio110/sites/onlinecourses.science.psu.edu.bio110/files/u4/Tutorial2_Chromosome_0.jpg" style="float: left; height: 180px; width: 140px; margin: 10px;" /></a></h2>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
  <p>The inheritance of traits is due to the transmission of <strong>genes</strong> from parents to offspring, and these genes code for the physical  similarities that we observe. A gene is a heritable unit. In cells,  nuclear DNA is organized into chromosomes. Genes occupy specific  positions on chromosomes. More than one form of a gene may exist, and  these alternative forms of the gene (<strong>alleles</strong>) result in the  formation of slightly different proteins and enzymes that sometimes  manifest themselves as differences in physical appearance, physiological  functioning, etc.</p></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><p><a class="highslide" href="/sites/onlinecourses.science.psu.edu.bio110/files/u4/Tutorial2_Compartive%20Scale%20of%20Mapping1.jpg" onclick="return hs.expand(this)"><img alt="Tutorial 2 Comparative Scale of Mapping" src="https://onlinecourses.science.psu.edu/bio110/sites/onlinecourses.science.psu.edu.bio110/files/u4/Tutorial2_Compartive%20Scale%20of%20Mapping1.jpg" style="float: right; height: 180px; width: 200px; margin: 10px;" /></a>By passing chromosomes from parents to offspring, genes are  transmitted from one generation to the next resulting in similarities  between parents and offspring. All eukaryotic organisms have their  genetic material subdivided into chromosomes, although the number of  chromosomes differs by species (e.g., humans have 46 chromosomes, dogs  have 78, cats have 34, and mosquitoes have only 6). Regardless of the  number of chromosomes, the underlying principles of inheritance are the  same for all species. To better understand the scale and relationship of  nucleotide sequences, genes and chromosomes, examine the figure  illustrating the Comparative Scale of Mapping on the right.</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In normal humans, any cell that is not a sperm or ovum contains 46  chromosomes. These 46 chromosomes actually occur as 23 pairs of  chromosomes, and the two chromosomes in a pair are identical in length  and shape (except in males, who have one pair of nonidentical  chromosomes: an X and a Y chromosome). The two chromosomes in the pair  also have the same genes; if a gene for hair color is located at one  location on one chromosome (commonly referred to as a locus; plural,  loci), its <strong>homologous chromosome</strong> will have the hair color gene at  the same location. Importantly, the homologues may or may not have the  same allele for the gene. This is because one homologue comes from each  parent.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Life Cycles</h2><div style="text-align: justify;"><p><a class="highslide" href="/sites/onlinecourses.science.psu.edu.bio110/files/u4/Tutorial2_Figure2TheHumanLifeCycle.jpg" onclick="return hs.expand(this)"> <img alt="Tutorial 2 Figure 2. The Human Life Cycle" src="https://onlinecourses.science.psu.edu/bio110/sites/onlinecourses.science.psu.edu.bio110/files/u4/Tutorial2_Figure2TheHumanLifeCycle.jpg" style="float: right; height: 180px; width: 200px; margin: 10px;"> </a>This figure illustrates the human life cycle. Adults produce <strong>gametes</strong> (reproductive cells termed sperm and eggs) by <strong>meiosis</strong>&nbsp; (a type of nuclear division), and each gamete contains only one-half  the number of chromosomes found in the nonreproductive cells of the  parent. The nonreproductive cells (containing 46 chromosomes) are called  <strong>diploid cells</strong>, and are abbreviated as "2<em>n</em>." The gametes (containing 23 chromosomes) are called <strong>haploid cells</strong>, and are abbreviated as "<em>n</em>." When a haploid ovum and a haploid sperm unite through <strong>fertilization</strong>, a diploid <strong>zygote</strong> is produced. This life cycle describes how diploid (2<em>n</em>) adults produce haploid (<em>n</em>) gametes, which then unite to form a new diploid (2<em>n</em>) zygote.</p></div><p style="text-align: justify;">This alternation of meiosis and fertilization is found in the sexual  life cycles of all sexually reproducing organisms, but its timing can  differ considerably depending on the organism. The human life cycle  typifies the most common life cycle found in animals, where the gametes  are the only haploid cells. They combine to form a zygote, which divides  by mitosis (another type of nuclear division) and grows to form a new individual.</p> <p style="text-align: justify;">In a second type of life cycle, as seen in most fungi and some  protists (unicellular eukaryotes and their somewhat simple multicellular  relatives), the diploid zygote produces haploid cells by meiosis; these  develop into free-living, haploid multicellular organisms. These  haploid organisms then produce modified gametes by mitosis (they are  already haploid, therefore, they cannot undergo meiosis), and these  gametes unite to form diploid zygotes. Some plants and algae exhibit yet  another type of life cycle, which will be described when we discuss  plants and algae later in this course. Although these three types of  life cycles differ in the timing of fertilization and meiosis, they all  produce genetic variation in their offspring. Next we will examine the  process of meiosis and see how genetic variation arises.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Meiosis<a class="highslide" href="/sites/onlinecourses.science.psu.edu.bio110/files/u4/Tutorial2_Figure3Meiosis.jpg" onclick="return hs.expand(this)"><img alt="Tutorial 2 Figure 3. Meiosis" src="https://onlinecourses.science.psu.edu/bio110/sites/onlinecourses.science.psu.edu.bio110/files/u4/Tutorial2_Figure3Meiosis.jpg" style="float: left; height: 150px; width: 180px; margin: 10px;" /></a></h2>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
  <p>Organisms such as humans have two haploid sets of chromosomes, one  set inherited from a male in the sperm and the second set from a female  in the egg. Thus, we have a duplicate set of each of our 23 chromosomes.  A pair of duplicate chromosomes is known as a homologous pair. Each  generation, human males and females reduce their chromosome numbers in  half, but must insure that each gamete has a complete set of half of the  chromosomes.</p></div><div style="text-align: justify;">
  <p>The primary function of meiosis in diploid organisms is the proper  distribution of homologous chromosomes. Meiosis has three essential  phases, (1) pairing of homologous chromosomes, (2) locking of the  chromosomes together via crossing over, and disjunction or segregatio<a class="highslide" href="sites/onlinecourses.science.psu.edu.bio110/files/u4/Tutorial2_Meiosis.jpg" onclick="return hs.expand(this)"><img alt="Tutorial 2 - Meiosis" src="https://onlinecourses.science.psu.edu/bio110/sites/onlinecourses.science.psu.edu.bio110/files/u4/Tutorial2_Meiosis.jpg" style="float: right; height: 240px; width: 180px; margin: 10px;" /></a>n  of the chromosomes into two daughter cells. As shown in this figure,  cells go from the diploid to haploid state through an initial  replication of chromosomes (resulting in <strong>sister chromatids</strong> and <strong>nonsister chromatids</strong>),  followed by two divisions called meiosis I and meiosis II. At the  conclusion of meiosis, four daughter cells are formed, each with  one-half the normal number of chromosomes. One consequence of meiosis isthat new genetic diversity arises due to two factors: the independent  assortment of homologous chromosomes to gametes, and crossing over  (recombination) in prophase I of meiosis. Before we examine these two  factors, you must first familiarize yourself with the process of  meiosis. To do so, view the illustrations of meiosis on the right.</p></div> 
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now that you are familiar with meiosis, let's examine the factors that lead to genetic diversity in this process.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Independent Assortment</h2><div style="text-align: justify;"><p><a class="highslide" href="/sites/onlinecourses.science.psu.edu.bio110/files/u4/Tutorial2_Figure4MeiosisI.jpg" onclick="return hs.expand(this)"><img alt="Tutorial 2nFigure 4. Meiosis I" src="https://onlinecourses.science.psu.edu/bio110/sites/onlinecourses.science.psu.edu.bio110/files/u4/Tutorial2_Figure4MeiosisI.jpg" style="float: left; height: 150px; width: 170px; margin: 10px;" /></a>The first source of genetic variation, <strong>independent assortment</strong>,  occurs in metaphase I, when the homologous chromosomes line up on the  metaphase plate. Orientation of the pairs is random; therefore, which  chromosome (maternal or paternal) goes to each daughter cell is random. A  particular daughter cell has a 50% chance of getting either the  maternal or paternal chromosome for each homologous pair. This figure  illustrates two pairs of homologous chromosomes and how their random  alignment at the metaphase plate can lead to different combinations of  chromosomes in the daughter cells that are produced. The chromosome  pairs align independently of one another. Therefore, the number of  different combinations of chromosomes in the daughter cells is equal to 2<sup>n</sup>,  where n = the haploid number of chromosomes (or the number of  chromosome pairs). In this example there are two chromosomes, so there  are 2<sup>2</sup> = 4 different chromosome combinations in the daughter  cells. If we look at the whole human genetic complement (n = 23), the  number of different combinations is 2<sup>23</sup> = 8,388,608. Due only  to the independent assortment of chromosomes in meiosis I, over 8  million genetically distinct gametes can be produced.</p></div> 
<p style="text-align: justify;">When making these computations, calculate the number of possibilities  using the number of pairs, not the total number of chromosomes;  remember that sex chromosomes are not homologous.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Crossing Over</h2><div style="text-align: justify;"><p><a class="highslide" href="/sites/onlinecourses.science.psu.edu.bio110/files/u4/Tutorial2_Figure%201%20Binary%20Fission.jpg" onclick="return hs.expand(this)"><img alt="Tutorial 2 Figure 1. Binary Fission" src="https://onlinecourses.science.psu.edu/bio110/sites/onlinecourses.science.psu.edu.bio110/files/u4/Tutorial2_Figure%201%20Binary%20Fission.jpg" style="float: right; height: 150px; width: 170px; margin: 10px;"></a>A second source of genetic variation during meiosis is the exchange of  genetic material between the maternal and paternal chromosomes, a  process called <strong>crossing over</strong> or <strong>recombination</strong>. While the  homologous chromosomes are paired together in prophase I, pieces of one  chromosome may be exchanged with the identical portion of the other  chromosome. This means that the resulting chromosomes are not entirely  maternal or paternal, but rather a mixture of both. In humans, crossing  over occurs about 2-3 times per chromosome pair, between nonsister  chromatids only (not between sister chromatids).</p></div><div style="text-align: justify;">
  <p><a class="highslide" href="/sites/onlinecourses.science.psu.edu.bio110/files/u4/Tutorial2crossover.swf?version=1&modificationDate=1246041194000?displayInline=true" onclick="return hs.expand(this)"><img alt="Crossing Over" src="https://onlinecourses.science.psu.edu/bio110/sites/onlinecourses.science.psu.edu.bio110/files/u4/Tutorial2crossover.swf?version=1&modificationDate=1246041194000?displayInline=true" style="float: right; height: 160px; width: 180px; margin: 10px;" /></a>View this animation of crossing over to reinforce this concept.</p></div><p style="text-align: justify;">As previously described, meiosis gives rise to genetic variation  through the independent assortment of chromosomes and recombination  between pairs of homologous chromosomes. If we also consider random  fertilization, the amount of genetic variation increases more. Let's  consider the example of a human couple having a child. Over 8 million  different genetic combinations are possible in the father's sperm, and  an equal number in the mother's ovum. The number of unique genetic  combinations would be (8 million)(8 million) = 64 trillion when a sperm  and ovum randomly unite to form a zygote. Therefore, sexual reproduction  is an effective way to create offspring with genetic variation. Why is  this important?</p> <p style="text-align: justify;">Populations evolve through natural selection. In order for natural  selection to operate, genetic variation must be present. Genetic  variation leads to heterogeneity between generations; if the environment  favors one variant, then this advantageous variant will increase in  frequency over generational time. If environmental conditions change,  individuals migrate, or new predators or pathogens are introduced, then  genetic variation may enable some individuals to do better in these new  conditions. Therefore, genetic variation is "insurance" for organisms  against changing conditions because it helps to insure that some of  their offspring will survive if conditions change.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Summary</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">This tutorial demonstrated how traits are passed from one generation  to the next. In each generation, sexually reproducing eukaryotes undergo  a series of reproductive events that can be summarized by a life cycle.  There are some differences in the details of various life cycles, but  in essence the life cycle describes how the genetic composition of the  cells involved in reproduction alternates between a 1n (haploid) and 2n  (diploid) state. Superficially, this seems simple and straightforward;  that is, two haploid gametes fuse (at some point in the life cycle),  resulting in a diploid (2n) organism; one or more cells in this 2n  organism then (at some point) undergo meiosis, giving rise to haploid  gametes that potentially go on to form the next generation, etc.  However, this is only part of the importance of the life cycle.</p> <p style="text-align: justify;">The mechanisms involved in the haploid/diploid/haploid transitions  lead to genetic variation. All eukaryotic organisms have the majority of  their DNA arranged in a set of chromosomes (found within the nucleus).  Humans have 46 chromosomes (2n). Our gametes have 23 chromosomes (1n).  Each of us received half of our chromosomes from each parent. However,  the combination of 23 chromosomes received from each of our parents was  not the same complement that our siblings received (which explains why  most siblings look similar but nonidentical). This scenario provides a  major source of variation between generations (as does crossing over  between paternal and maternal chromosomes).</p> <p style="text-align: justify;">Each of our 23 haploid chromosomes has a similar but nonidentical  partner termed a homologue. It is essential to remember that homologues  are not identical. Therefore, the diploid composition can be described  as 23 pairs of homologous chromosomes. During meiosis, these homologues  will be segregated into four progeny cells, each of which will have a  haploid chromosome complement. The cellular process by which these  similar, yet nonidentical, chromosomes are physically moved during  meiosis results in a random distribution of the 23 chromosomes into the  haploid cells. Because this process occurs randomly, we can use  statistics to predict the number of possible outcomes.</p> <p style="text-align: justify;">In metaphase I of meiosis, the replicated chromosomes appear situated  in a row with the homologues lined up opposite one another.  Importantly, how they pair is random. For example, the paternal  homologue of chromosome 1 may line up on one side, whereas the paternal  homologue of chromosome 2 may line up on the other side (remember, then  the maternal pair would be on opposite sides as well). The odds that the  paternal member of a given homologous pair lines up on one side is  equal to 50% (or 0.5 or 1:1); i.e., it goes either on one side or the  other. The odds that the paternal members of two chromosomes line up on  the same side is then a product of their individual probabilities; i.e.,  0.5 x 0.5 = 0.25 (or 1:4). What would be the odds of all 23 paternal  chromosomes lining up on one side? The solution is 2<sup>23</sup> or 1  in 8 million. This is also the odds of any other specific combination  occurring during metaphase I. In metaphase II, the segregated homologues  will separate. There is only one way this will occur, so the  probabilities outlined for the events at metaphase I can be extended to  the entire process of meiosis.</p> <p style="text-align: justify;">Let's put together the events occurring during meiosis for both  parents. If the combination for a specific arrangement of chromosomes in  each parent is 8 million, what are the odds of a specific diploid  arrangement occurring? (Fertilization is somewhat random and therefore  can be described statistically.) Again, the probability is a product of  their independent probabilities, which is 8 million x 8 million = 64  trillion.</p> <p style="text-align: justify;">The process of random segregation of chromosomes during meiosis  provides for an incredible amount of potential variation. Crossing over  in prophase I adds another level of variation to the genetic character  of gametes, and this will be explored in more detail later.</p>
