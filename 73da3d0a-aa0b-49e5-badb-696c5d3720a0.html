<p>We all agree that a cat is an animal, but what is it that makes it an animal? Why is a sponge an animal? Why are sponges and cats placed in the same kingdom? You might think that some corals look more like plants, and that sponges don't look like much of anything; at least, not&nbsp;anything living. Why are these diverse organisms all classified as animals?</p>
<p>There are some basic features that are found in all of the members of the kingdom Animalia. In general, animals are all motile, heterotrophic, and multicellular.</p>
<p>Motility refers to the ability to move and/or affect motion in&nbsp;the organism's&nbsp;vicinity. For example, adult sponges don't move from place to place, but they&nbsp;have specialized cells that create currents and capture food particles, and other cells that distribute food in their body. Also, while some animals are sessile as adults, all animals exhibit movement from place to place sometime in their development. For example, sponges and corals are motile as&nbsp;<strong>larvae</strong>&nbsp;(the very early stages of embryonic development) and sessile as adults. A myriad of adaptations for motility are observed in animals, and some of these will be addressed in this tutorial. This figure&nbsp;depicts the development of a sponge, with both motile and sessile stages.</p>

<p>Animals are ingestive heterotrophs;, they ingest nutrients, bringing them into their bodies for digestion. Unlike plants, which store their food as starch, animals store their food as glycogen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most animals have muscle tissue and nervous tissue. These tissues can range from being simple (as seen in members of the radiata) to being highly complex (as seen in vertebrates). The coordination between muscle tissue and nervous tissue can result in very specialized movements (e.g., getting food, pursuing a mate, avoiding a predator).</p>

<p>The first animals likely originated from a colonial protist similar to&nbsp;<strong>choanoflagellates</strong>. Choanoflagellates share some basic feature with animals, the parazoa in particular.&nbsp;This colony of individual cells is anchored to a substrate, and&nbsp;each flagellum sweeps food into a cell for ingestion. The cell can then transfer the food to other cells. While this organism shows little specialization, it&nbsp;displays a very primitive form of multicellularity and ingestive heterotrophy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Molecular data also place&nbsp;choanoflagellates the group of protists most closely related to animals.&nbsp;Animals first appear in the fossil record approximately 750 million years ago, but&nbsp;molecular data suggest that animals&nbsp;evolved much earlier.&nbsp;</p>
