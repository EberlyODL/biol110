<p>This tutorial will begin our discussion of Kingdom Animalia. First, we will discuss what makes an organism an animal. Then, we will focus on some major innovations in the evolution of animals. Then we will discussion animal development (from a single-cell zygote through a specialized embryo). This tutorial will begin our discussion of specific phyla within the kingdom Animalia, beginning with the parazoans and continuing through the acoelomates. As we introduce new topics in animal classification, keep in mind the phylogenetic tree of animals. Also, think about how form (morphology) relates to function. That is, how does an animal's shape and organization affect what it is able to do? This tutorial will provide a more detailed look at the first three major branching points in the phylogenetic tree of animals. The following two tutorials will continue a discussion of animal diversity. By the end of this tutorial you should have an understanding of:</p>
<ul><li>The general characteristics of all animals</li><li>The origin and early evolution of animals</li><li>The major early branching points in the phylogeny of animal evolution</li><li>The basic steps involved in animal development</li><li>Characteristics of organisms in the phyla Porifera, Cnidaria, and Platyhelminthes</li><li>The different types of body cavities found in bilateral animals</li><li>How certain flatworms can cause disease in humans</li></ul>
<p>Performance Objectives:</p>
<ul><li>Summarize the general characteristics of animals</li><li>Review the evolutionary history of animals and their relationship to protists</li><li>Define tissues, symmetry, cephalization</li><li>Describe the early stages of animal development, including tissue and gut formation</li><li>Differentiate between radiata and bilateria, diploblasts and triploblasts</li><li>Discuss the role of Hox genes in animal development</li><li>Discuss the reason for the basal position of sponges in the animal phylogenetic tree and the characteristics of sponges</li><li>Explain the characteristics of the Radiata</li><li>Diagram the three different body cavity types found in the bilateria</li><li>Describe the characteristics of the flatworms and some examples of diseases they cause</li></ul>
