<h2>Antiquity of Life Part 3 VoiceThread Transcript</h2>
<p>Slide 1<br>Let's see how you did answering this practice problem. This question asks you to calculate the age of a sample that has 25% of the original amount of C-14.</p>
<p>Slide 2<br>The answer is D - 11,460 years old.&nbsp; So, why is this the correct answer?</p>
<p>Slide 3<br>Organisms accumulate C-14 throughout their lives.&nbsp; At the time of death, an organism has a certain amount of C-14.&nbsp; After death, the C-14 begins to decay into N-14.</p>
<p>So we can consider the time of death to be time 0.&nbsp; At t=0, the organism has 100% of its C-14 content.</p>
<p>After each half-life, the organism loses 50% of its C-14 to radioactive decay.</p>
<p>Slide 4<br>In other words, we can consider time 0 as 100% of the C-14 content.</p>
<p>At time 1 (one half-life), the amount of C-14 is 50% of the original amount.&nbsp; Remember, one half-life loses half of the original C-14 to radioactive decay.</p>
<p>At time 2 (two half-lives), the amount of C-14 is 25% of the original. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The half-life of C-14 is 5730 years, so if a sample has 25% of its original C-14 it can be calculated to be 11,460 years old (this is calculated by multiplying 5730 years x 2).</p>
<p>Actual radiometric dating calculations are more complicated but follow this same basic idea.</p>
