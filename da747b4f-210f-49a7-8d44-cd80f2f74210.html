<p>Life is composed of a diversity of biomolecules (molecules found in living organisms). With all of life's diversity, however, there is a ubiquitous presence of carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen. Carbon plays a particularly important role in these molecules by virtue of its unique chemical properties. In this tutorial you will learn why some biomolecules readily interact with water, and why some do not. We will examine how relatively simple subunits, known as monomers, can be linked together by chemical bonds to make much larger complex macromolecules, known as polymers.</p>
<p>By the end of this tutorial you should be able to:</p>
<ul><li>Describe the structure of a water molecule and how it&nbsp;interacts with other water molecules</li><li>Explain the basic properties of water&nbsp;and the importance of these properties to organisms</li><li>Explain how carbon is the backbone of biological molecules</li><li>Define and give examples of anabolic and catabolic reactions</li><li>Describe the basic structure of the monomer(s) and polymer(s), and the functions of each of the major groups of molecules in cells and organisms</li></ul>
