<p>Mendelian inheritance in humans is difficult to study because humans produce relatively few offspring (as compared to many other species) and they have a generation time of about 20 years. These two factors, in addition to ethical issues, make it impossible to design breeding experiments using humans. &nbsp;&nbsp;There are many characters in humans that show a Mendelian pattern of inheritance.&nbsp; This web page, the OMIM (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man -&nbsp;<a href="http://www.omim.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.omim.org/</a>&nbsp;) is a catalog of these characters. You can search for a particular character (for example, dimples) to learn more about what is known about its inheritance.

<h2 id="TheExpressionofMultipleAllelesandPedigreeAnalysis-Pedigrees">Pedigrees
</h2>
<p>Our understanding of Mendelian inheritance in humans is based on the analysis of matings that have already occurred (the opposite of planned experiments), a family&nbsp;<strong>pedigree</strong>. Human pedigrees describe the interrelationships between parents and children, over generations, regarding a specific trait. Mendel's laws of inheritance can be used to analyze the pedigree and genotypes of the individuals in the pedigree.

</h2>
<p>The pedigree at left below&nbsp;shows a pattern of inheritance that can be observed for a recessive trait. The half-filled symbols denote&nbsp;<strong>carriers</strong>&nbsp;(heterozygotes).&nbsp; Carriers are&nbsp;a person or other organism that has inherited a recessive allele for a&nbsp;trait but does not display that trait (or show symptoms of the disease).&nbsp;&nbsp;Note that an individual expressing a recessive trait (homozygous recessive) may not appear every generation, but carriers are still present.&nbsp;&nbsp; Carriers are only seen when two traits have a complete dominance relationship (one is completely dominant to the other).

<p>The pedigree above at right shows the pattern of inheritance for albinism, which typically shows a recessive mode of inheritance in humans. In this pedigree (as with most pedigree charts) heterozygotes are not marked, but you can infer their presence by the pattern of the affected individuals. Take a close look at this pedigree and locate the two cousins who marry and have children. Can you see why many societies have taboos regarding the marriage of first cousins?&nbsp;

<h2 id="TheExpressionofMultipleAllelesandPedigreeAnalysis-PatternsofInheritanceforThreeHumanGeneticDisorders">Patterns of Inheritance for Three Human Genetic Disorders
</h2>
<p>Next we will examine three diseases caused by deleterious recessive alleles:&nbsp;<strong>cystic fibrosis</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>phenylketonuria</strong>, and&nbsp;<strong>sickle-cell</strong>&nbsp;disease. Phenotypically normal parents must both be carriers (heterozygous) in order for the disease to occur in their offspring. Remember, these are recessively inherited traits; an individual must inherit one allele from each carrier parent to exhibit the phenotype. Each time two carriers conceive a child, there is a 25% chance that the child will exhibit the phenotype, a 50% chance that the child will be a carrier, and a 25% chance that the child will be a non-carrier.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2 id="TheExpressionofMultipleAllelesandPedigreeAnalysis-CysticFibrosis">Cystic Fibrosis
</h2>
<p>Cystic fibrosis (CF) is one of the most common genetic diseases that affects people of Caucasian ancestry. In a room of 20-30 such persons, approximately one is a carrier. The deleterious allele that causes this disease encodes a protein that is involved in chloride ion transport. As a result, individuals with homozygous alleles for this gene have problems with salt balance in cells (particularly those cells that line the lungs and intestines). This salt imbalance causes the mucus coating of certain cells to become unusually thick, causing affected individuals to show a dangerous buildup of mucus.
</p>
<p>Cystic fibrosis is pleiotropic, and a number of symptoms can result (e.g., lung infections, sterility in males).
</p>
<p>To avoid lung infections, many treatments have been developed to either reduce mucus viscosity or help dislodge it from the lungs. These include various aerosolized drugs, as well as various mechanical methods. In the past, physical therapists would manually pound the patientâ€™s chest to help dislodge sputum; now there are special vests which use air pressure to produce the same effect.
</p>
<p>Why is this harmful allele so prevalent if it is so bad? Molecular evolutionary analyses of this allele indicate that it first appeared about 52,000 years ago (about the time when nearby eastern human populations were invading Europe to displace the Neanderthals). The prevalence of this gene in modern populations, along with its age, suggests that there probably was some selective advantage for the heterozygous state.&nbsp; This phenomenon is known as "heterozygote advantage". &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Heterozygote advantage</strong>&nbsp;describes the situation in which the heterozygote has a higher relative fitness than either the homozygote dominant or recessive genotype.&nbsp; What was this advantage with regard to CF? There have been several theories but at this time, no one knows for sure.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2 id="TheExpressionofMultipleAllelesandPedigreeAnalysis-Phenylketonuria">Phenylketonuria
</h2>
<p>Phenylketonuria (PKU) is not as prevalent as cystic fibrosis. About 1 in 50 persons of Caucasian ancestry carry the defective allele. (1 in 64 persons of Asian ancestry have this allele, as well as 1 in 34 persons of Irish ancestry). The disease is only observed in individuals that are homozygous for the recessive allele, and the main symptom of PKU is mental retardation. The defective allele encodes for a nonfunctional phenylalanine hydrolase enzyme that normally converts the amino acid phenylalanine to the amino acid tyrosine. Those affected with PKU accumulate high levels of phenyalanine (and/or its metabolites), therefore, they have low levels of tyrosine. The high levels of phenyalanine metabolites affect neuronal development, which leads to mental retardation.
</p>
<p>Importantly, the symptoms associated with this disease can be prevented with proper nutrition. Phenylalanine is an amino acid found in many proteins; therefore, patients affected with PKU can escape the disease by strictly limiting themselves to low protein diets. Providing that PKU is detected early (most states require that all newborns be tested, which is done 24 to 72 hours after a baby is born), proper nutrition will prevent the disease. There are doctors, lawyers, and teachers who are homozygous for PKU, yet they lead normal lives (albeit with a life-long restricted diet).
</p>
<p>PKU is a good example of not only a disease caused by a recessive allele, but also an example of a genetic condition in which the phenotype is strongly affected by the environment; with the proper diet, the phenotype is not expressed.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2 id="TheExpressionofMultipleAllelesandPedigreeAnalysis-Sickle-CellAnemia">Sickle-Cell Anemia
</h2>
<p>Sickle-cell disease is one of the most common genetic diseases that affects mainly persons of African ancestry. About 10% carry the allele for this trait. (In some areas of Africa, upwards of 40% carry the allele.) Individuals that are homozygous for the sickle cell allele have sickle-cell disease and suffer from a number of problems including anemia, pain, fever, and fatigue. The sickle-cell trait affects the hemoglobin molecule found in red blood cells, which is involved in oxygen transport. Left untreated, patients with sickle-cell disease typically die by the age of thirty.
</p>
<p>As with cystic fibrosis, the high prevalence of the allele in the population suggests that there is some benefit to carrying it in a heterozygous state. Indeed, this is the case. It is known that those individuals who are heterozygous are less susceptible to malaria than those who are homozygous for the normal hemoglobin allele.. It is not surprising then that the highest frequency of the sickle cell allele is found in areas where malaria is prevalent. This allele is one of the best examples of natural selection in humans as well as one of the best examples of heterozygote advantage.

<p>The figure below shows a pedigree of brachydactyly - a dominant condition associated with shortness of fingers and toes.&nbsp;The actress Megan Fox has brachydactyly of her thumbs.
</p>
<p>The pedigree examples shown here best fit a dominant pattern of inheritance because:
</p>
<ul><li>The trait does not skip a generation.</li><li>Where one parent is affected, about half of the progeny are affected..&nbsp;</li>

<h2 id="TheExpressionofMultipleAllelesandPedigreeAnalysis-Huntington'sChorea">Huntington's Disease
</h2>
<p><strong>Huntingtons Disease</strong>&nbsp;(HD) is a hereditary disease that causes progressive damage to the nervous system. It generally develops subtly in a person's thirties or forties (though it can begin any time between childhood and old age). It is characterized by difficulties in three areas: uncontrollable movements, dementia, and psychiatric disturbances. &nbsp;Unlike the previous diseases described, which were caused by recessive alleles, HD is caused by a dominant allele. Most HD sufferers have one copy of the deleterious allele and one normal allele, so each of their children has a 50% chance of inheriting the disease. As you just read in the description of inheritance of dominant traits, HD does not tend to skip generations.
</p>
<p>It is important to note the late onset of this disease. This disease becomes noticeable after the normal child-bearing age. Also, consider that the life expectancy of men in America in the year 1900 was forty-six. Therefore, for much of modern human history (about 100,000-150,000 years) this disease probably was not prevalent because people died of other causes before HD symptoms appeared.

</p>
<p>This figure shows a pedigree for woolly hair - a condition characterized by tightly coiled hair. &nbsp;It is a dominant condition.&nbsp;&nbsp;The man at the top of the pedigree has normal hair, so his genotype is ww. His wife has woolly hair, but must be heterozygous (Ww) since three of their six children have normal hair.
</p>
<p>A pedigree not only allows a geneticist to understand the past, but it helps to predict the occurrence of a trait in future generations.
</p>
<p>If a woolly hair grandson marries a normal hair woman and they plan on having three children, the probability that all three children will have woolly hair is&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>/<sub>8</sub>. Since the man is heterozygous (Ww) and the wife is homozygous (ww), each child has a&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;probability of inheriting the woolly hair allele (<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;X&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;X&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>/<sub>8</sub>).
