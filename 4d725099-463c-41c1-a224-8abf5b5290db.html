<p>This figure&nbsp;demonstrates the relationship between Mendel's work and the behavior of chromosomes during meiosis. It shows how a dihybrid individual has two different alleles for each gene: here seed color (Y gene) and shape (R gene); the locations of the genes are indicated by lines on the chromosomes. Each gene is located at the same position on each member of the homologous pair. The random assortment of the homologous pairs in meiosis I results in different combinations of alleles for seed color and shape in the gametes. Through random fertilization, these four different gametes will lead to the characteristic 9:3:3:1 ratio observed by Mendel in his dihybrid crosses.</p>

<p>Although the relationship between genes and traits was fairly well accepted by the early 1900's, biologist T. H. Morgan of Columbia University first mapped a gene to a specific chromosome. One of the early pioneers working with fruit flies in genetic studies, Morgan (and his students) discovered one male fly with white eyes, a trait they had not seen in these flies. The phenotype that is prevalent in natural populations (<strong>wild-type</strong>) for this character is red eyes, so the individual had a&nbsp;<strong>mutant phenotype</strong>&nbsp;for this particular character.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To assist with his work, Morgan and his students developed a nomenclature system for distinguishing between the normal (wild-type) allele and its variants. This system is still used by&nbsp;<em>Drosophila</em>&nbsp;geneticists. The gene for a particular character is named for the first mutant phenotype discovered. In the case of eye color, the allele for white eyes was appropriately designated&nbsp;<em>w</em>, for "white." The wild-type allele uses the same letter but has a superscript&nbsp;+ . Therefore, the allele for red eyes is symbolized as&nbsp;<em>w+</em>. The white eye allele is then simply&nbsp;<em>w</em>. The letter identifying the mutant is lowercase if the allele is recessive (as in white eyes), or uppercase for those mutations that are dominant to the wild-type allele. The allele that causes curly wings, a dominant mutation, is symbolized as&nbsp;<em>Cy</em>, and the allele that codes for straight wings (wild type) is identified as&nbsp;<em>Cy+</em>.</p>
