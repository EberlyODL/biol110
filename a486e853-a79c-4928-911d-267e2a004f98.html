<h2>Carbon and Life Part 4 VoiceThread Transcript</h2>
<p>Slide 1<br>The proteins are a structurally very diverse group of macromolecules but they are all comprised of a group of 20 similar monomers.&nbsp; The monomers are collectively known as amino acids.&nbsp; An amino acid is a central carbon atom covalently bonded to an amino group, a carboxyl group, and a variable group indicated with the letter R.</p>
<p>Slide 2<br>The variable position is filled with one of these 20 different R groups to make 20 different amino acids.</p>
<p>The R-groups can be classified as being either nonpolar, polar or electrically charged.&nbsp; The nonpolar groups behave hydrophobically - they are repelled by water.</p>
<p>The polar and electrically charged R groups behave hydrophilically - they are attracted to water.</p>
<p>Later we will see how these hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions can result in either normal function of a protein and optimal health or abnormal protein function and serious health problems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Slide 3<br>Amino acids link together to produce a polypeptide - also known as a protein.&nbsp; Proteins are long polymers of amino acids and just as we saw with the steriods - subtle changes in structure can result in dramatic changes in function.</p>
<p>Slide 4<br>While proteins are long chains of amino acids - they typically do not remain in a linear structure.&nbsp; Instead, most protiens fold in precise 3-dimensional shapes.&nbsp; It is these very precise three dimensional shapes that give a protein its precise function.</p>
<p>Slide 5<br>The nucleic acids are polymers of nucleotides.&nbsp; The nucleic acids include the genetic material DNA and RNA.</p>
<p>A nucleotide is a central sugar bonded to a nitrogenous base and a phosphate group.</p>
<p>The central sugar can be either deoxyribose (as it is in DNA nucleotides) or ribse (as it is in RNA nucleotides). &nbsp;</p>
<p>The nitrogenous bases can be either Adenine, guanine, cytosine or thymine in DNA.&nbsp; An RNA molecule has the same nitrogenous bases except RNA uses Uracil instead of Thymine.</p>
<p>Slide 6<br>DNA molecules are double stranded molecules that are conneceted via hydrogen bonds between complementary nitrogenous bases.&nbsp; The base pairing rules are that Adenine pairs with thymine and guanine pairs with cytosine.&nbsp; Understanding these base pairing rules will be important when we look at the structure and function of DNA in more detail later in the course..</p>
