<h2>Telophase</h2>
<p>The replicated chromosomes (formally called chromatids) are at opposite poles at the end of anaphase. Both halves of the cell contain equal numbers and kinds of chromosomes. At this point, the nuclear membranes of the daughter cells begin to reform around the new chromosomes located at either end of the cell. At the same time, the chromosomes begin to decondense. The decondensation of chromosomes and nuclear envelope reformation characterizes the&nbsp;<strong>telophase</strong> stage of mitosis. Note that these two new nuclei contain identical genetic material. For instance, in a human cell there are 46 chromosomes: 23 of paternal origin and 23 of maternal origin. Telophase marks the last part of karyokinesis (the division of genetic material).</p>
<p>[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=2561|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__left__lightboxed]At the same time that nuclear membranes are reforming during telophase, something remarkable is happening to the other cellular components. Remember, the other organelles have already replicated on their own. They are also being separated into the two ends of the cell. The cell then closes off the center of the parent cell, thereby forming two new daughter cells. As previously mentioned, the process of partitioning the parental cytoplasm (including organelles) is called cytokinesis. Remember, both cytokinesis and karyokinesis are parts of mitosis.</p>
<h2>Cytokinesis</h2>
<p>Cell division includes the division of chromosomes (karyokinesis), as well as the division of the cytoplasm (cytokinesis). Reformation of the nuclear envelope around the daughter cell chromosomes marks the completion of karyokinesis. However, cell division is not complete until the cytoplasm has divided during cytokinesis (which typically begins during telophase).</p>
<p>The process of karyokinesis has been conserved throughout evolution. &nbsp;However, cytokinesis can be accomplished in more than one way. Cells are different and these differences put constraints on cytoplasmic partitioning. Two examples are plants and animals; this figure summarizes these differences.</p>

<p>Plant cells have cell membranes and rigid cell walls, however, animal cells have only cell membranes and are much more flexible. Therefore, these two types of cells have different mechanisms for cytokinesis.</p>
<p>Animal cells begin cytokinesis when the cell membrane pinches inward. This is called furrowing because a&nbsp;<strong>cleavage furrow</strong>&nbsp;forms between the two halves of the cell. The furrow gets deeper and deeper as the cytoplasm separates more and more. This process almost looks like someone is pulling a string tighter and tighter around the cell, to the point of splitting it in two. The cell membrane finally seals off and the original parental cell becomes two separate daughter cells.</p>
<p>Plant cells are not able to undergo the same process because they have a rigid, inflexible cell wall. These cells divide by forming a new piece of cell wall in their center. Vesicles deposit wall-building materials along the central area of the cell. Typically, this is the same plane where the chromosomes were lined up previously during metaphase. The new cell wall begins to form and the cell membrane is extended. The two daughter cells are eventually sealed off from one another by a new cell wall.</p>
<p>Other types of cytokinesis are also known, but will not be covered here. In all cases, however, the cytokinetic process is adapted to the particular character of the cell.</p>
