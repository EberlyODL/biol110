<p>At one time&nbsp;the glomeromycetes were considered to be members of the Zygomycota. &nbsp;However, based upon molecular data, the almost 250 species known are now recognized as a monophyletic group of fungi whose members are all mycorhizzae of plants.&nbsp; They form a specific type of structure, an arbuscle (a branched shrublike organ that penetrates the root cells of vascular plants), so are called the <strong>arbuscular mycorrhizal</strong> (AM) fungi. The arbuscle lives within the cell of the plant root, so it is termed an endophytic mycorrhizae. &nbsp;A mutualistic relationship has been discovered between an AM fungus living in the thallus of &nbsp;a liverwort, a member of the oldest group of land plants.&nbsp; This mutualism is thought to have been very important for the colonization of land by plants and is necessary for the function of terrestrial ecosystems (over 90% of living plants have mycorhizzae).&nbsp;</p>
