<p>It may be hard to envision life without oxygen, but the first prokaryotes (the first organisms on Earth) evolved in an environment with essentially no molecular oxygen (oxygen gas, or O<sub>2</sub>). Consequently, the first prokaryotes, which originated between 3.5 and 4 billion years ago, were&nbsp;<strong>anaerobic</strong>. Anaerobic is a general term that refers to any organism, environment, or cellular process that lacks or does not require oxygen, and may be poisoned by oxygen.&nbsp; In contrast, <strong>aerobic</strong> organisms require oxygen.</p>
<p>The original anaerobic organisms thrived in an environment devoid of oxygen. Many scientists think that the early prokaryotes were chemoautotrophs, obtaining energy from inorganic chemicals, possibly using the then-abundant hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S). Evidence to support this hypothesis can be observed in some hot springs, which contain members of the Archaea. They obtain energy from the combining of ferrous sulfide (FeS) and hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S).</p>

<p>The cyanobacteria, originating between 2.5 and 3.4 billion years ago, were the first photosynthetic bacteria to use water (H<sub>2</sub>O) as an electron source. They released oxygen as a waste product. These photosynthetic organisms thrived wherever there was sufficient light and a body of water. However, this created a problem on a global scale. After several hundred million years, free oxygen began to accumulate in the atmosphere, which marked the change from a reducing to an oxidizing atmosphere.&nbsp; Evidence for this great oxygenation event can be seen in the geological record. &nbsp;Initially the high levels of free oxygen were toxic to life. Organisms underwent adaptation through several mechanisms that mitigate this problem, including the use of oxygen in metabolism. Because we need oxygen for our survival, it is hard to believe that oxygen is toxic to many life forms.</p>
<p>Today prokaryotes (and other life forms) exhibit various metabolic relationships with oxygen.&nbsp;<strong>Obligate aerobes</strong>&nbsp;require oxygen, whereas&nbsp;<strong>obligate anaerobes</strong>&nbsp;have no need for oxygen and may even be poisoned by oxygen.&nbsp;<strong>Facultative anaerobes</strong>&nbsp;can alternate their oxygen requirement. They can use oxygen if it is present, but they can also function in an anaerobic environment. In the upcoming tutorials on energy and cellular respiration, the role of oxygen in cellular processes and how anaerobic organisms get by without oxygen will be addressed.</p>
