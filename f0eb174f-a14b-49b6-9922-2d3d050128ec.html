<p>The kingdom&nbsp;<strong>Alveolata</strong>&nbsp;is another diverse group. It includes some of the most ecologically interesting and economically important protists, including those that build coral reefs, those that cause malaria, and some of the organisms that poison fish during harmful algal blooms. This group is monophyletic and recognizable by their&nbsp;<strong>alveoli</strong>&nbsp;(small cavities enclosed in membranes that hug the internal cell surface). There are three distinct groups of&nbsp;<strong>alveolates</strong>: dinoflagellates, apicomplexans, and ciliates.&nbsp; The remainder of this tutorial will concentrate on the dinoflagellates and apicomplexans.</p>

<p><strong>Dinoflagellates</strong>&nbsp;usually have distinct shapes due to "frames" of cellulose within their cell walls. Their cell surface has perpendicular grooves that each contain a flagellum. These paired flagella, the defining characteristic of this group, beat within their grooves and cause dinoflagellates to rotate as they move forward. The word dinoflagellate is derived from the Greek word&nbsp;<em>dinos</em>, which means "rotation" or "whirling," and the Latin flagellum, which means "whip."</p>
<p>[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=2488|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__right___lightboxed]</p>
<p>Many dinoflagellates are photosynthetic and they comprise a significant proportion of the&nbsp;<strong>phytoplankton</strong>&nbsp;that floats near the surface of the ocean, making them a critical component of the aquatic food web. Phytoplankton are an essential food resource for many other organisms, ranging from heterotrophic protists to baleen whales and many other organisms in between (most of whom serve as food themselves for creatures at higher trophic levels).</p>
<p style="clear:both;">[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=2463|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__lightboxed]</p>
<p>Not all dinoflagellates are photosynthetic; many are heterotrophic. Some of these heterotrophs exploit chloroplasts from photosynthetic protists, becoming autotrophic themselves for a time. Some dinoflagellates live in symbiosis with different species, as parasites in some cases and as mutualists in others.</p>
<p>[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=2465|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__left__lightboxed]Some dinoflagellates, such as those in the genus&nbsp;<em>Noctiluca</em>, have the ability to&nbsp;bioluminesce&nbsp;(make their own light). This is accomplished with the compound luciferin, which is the same chemical that makes fireflies glow.&nbsp;<em>Noctiluca</em>&nbsp;floats just under the surface of the ocean, and when individuals number in the millions they can produce spectacular glowing tides. The blue in the image is the visible glow that is triggered by the tumbling dinoflagellates as the water is disrupted. If you walk along the tide line of a beach with these dinoflagellates, your footprints actually glow with each step when your foot disturbs these bioluminescent protists. How bioluminescence evolved is not completely understood. The Burglar Alarm theory posits that the bioluminescent glow attracts predators of dinoflagellate predators and this allows the glowing protist to escape predation.</p>

<p></p>
<p>One of the mutualistic associations formed by dinoflagellates is their symbiotic relationship with reef-building cnidarians, animals in the same phylum as sea anemones and jellyfish. Corals engulf dinoflagellates but do not digest them; rather, these dinoflagellates, called&nbsp;<strong>zooxanthellae</strong>, live out their lives within the tissues of corals. How do you think each of the partners in this mutualistic symbiosis benefit?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Coral reefs are actually composed of the&nbsp;<strong>exoskeletons</strong>&nbsp;(secreted calcium carbonate shells) from countless generations of organisms, each of which anchored itself onto the remains of the previous generation, secreting more calcium carbonate and building up the reef incrementally over time.</p>
<p>While some corals are capable of existing without symbiotic protists, they do not thrive and the rate of calcium carbonate deposition (reef-building) is far slower when dinoflagellates are absent. As tiny as dinoflagellates are, the energy they provide helps the corals to&nbsp;build reefs that are thousands of miles long.</p>
<p>Furthermore, reefs are complex vital ecosystems that support many life forms that simply would not exist if reefs disappeared; therefore, a great many organisms are indirectly dependent on the activity of dinoflagellates.</p>
<p>Recently many reefs have begun to suffer, becoming dramatically bleached in appearance as the corals lose their zooxanthellae. There have been a number of hypotheses advanced to explain this phenomenon (e.g., pollution, an increase in ultraviolet light due to the widening hole in the ozone, and global temperature changes); all of these factors can be traced back to the impact of humans on the environment. Others suggest that natural weather fluctuations or disease outbreaks may be responsible. Whatever the ultimate cause, loss of symbiotic dinoflagellates appears to be the immediate source for the bleaching.&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="ProtistsI-ProtistswithModifiedMitochondria,KingdomsEuglenozoaandAlveolata-DinoflagellatesandRedTide">Dinoflagellates and Red Tide</h3>[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=2473|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__left__lightboxed]
<p>Dinoflagellates are the organisms responsible for red tide events, or "harmful algal blooms" (HABs). Blooms (population explosions) of dinoflagellates are called "red tides" because dinoflagellates can reach such high densities that they actually change the color of the water in which they reside. Depending on the pigments present in these dinoflagellates, these tides will appear brown, red, orange, or yellow.</p>
<p></p> [ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=2475|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__right__lightboxed]
<p style="clear: left;">A number of dinoflagellate species release toxins into the water, killing many aquatic animals during major algal blooms and poisoning others with sublethal doses of toxins. The primary function of these compounds is probably defensive, warding off or poisoning grazers, and perhaps preventing competing algal species from gaining a foothold in monospecific mats of&nbsp;<strong>plankton</strong>&nbsp;(minute animal and plant life in the ocean).</p>
<p>The dinoflagellate responsible for the Florida red tide (<em>Karenia brevis</em> ) releases neurotoxic brevetoxins into the surrounding water that are then aerosolized.&nbsp; These aerosolized toxins&nbsp; increase the incidence of respiratory infections among inland populations by 54%.</p>
<p>In any case, filter feeders, such as shellfish, are particularly vulnerable to brevetoxins because they actively ingest plankton. In turn, heterotrophs (including humans) that eat poisoned animals are often themselves unintended victims of the dinoflagellates' defensive chemicals, contracting such conditions as paralytic shellfish poisoning. The compounds involved are neurotoxins, poisons that attack the central nervous system, so they are particularly nasty, producing symptoms such as delirium and respiratory paralysis.</p> [ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=2477|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__left__lightboxed]
<p>One red tide organism,&nbsp;<em>Pfiesteria</em>, is unusual in that it uses toxins specifically to kill fish, stunning them and then feeding on their tissues (or on other protists that thrive on decaying fish).&nbsp;<em>Pfiesteria</em>&nbsp;also produce some of the most ecologically severe red tides, sometimes killing enormous numbers of fish. It is not clear how&nbsp;<em>Pfiesteria</em>&nbsp;affect humans, but there does seem to be considerable evidence that people exposed to its toxin by physical contact with affected fish or water containing&nbsp;<em>Pfiesteria</em>&nbsp;suffer various symptoms (e.g., skin lesions and loss of cognitive function).</p>
<p></p>
<p>HABs seem to be on the rise. Scientists believe that the enrichment of oceans and estuarine waters from fertilizer runoff has created an aquatic environment that favors dinoflagellate blooms. Research is underway to learn more about the causes of HABs, with the ultimate goal of designing viable control measures.&nbsp;</p> [ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=2479|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__right__lightboxed]
<p>Can protists really be seen from space? They can if they cause red tides. NOAA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, sponsors many programs to monitor HABs using satellite imagery. This image is from a study that is focused on the dinoflagellate&nbsp;<em>Gymnodinium breve</em>, which causes HABs in the Gulf of Mexico.</p>

<h3 id="ProtistsI-ProtistswithModifiedMitochondria,KingdomsEuglenozoaandAlveolata-KingdomAlveolata:Apicomplexans">Kingdom Alveolata: Apicomplexans</h3>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Apicomplexans</strong>&nbsp;are parasites, specialized for living and reproducing within the tissues of animals. The&nbsp;<strong>apical complex</strong>&nbsp;is a cluster of microtubules and organelles located in the apex of cells that are in the infectious stage. This structure's function is to facilitate penetration of host cells. A number of apicomplexans require more than one host to complete their complicated life cycles. The infamous&nbsp;<em>Plasmodium</em>, which causes malaria in humans and other animals, is an apicomplexan transmitted by mosquitoes.</p>
<p>[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=2481|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__right__lightboxed]</p>
<p>More people are killed each year by malaria than by any other transmissible disease (besides tuberculosis).&nbsp; In 2015 there were 212 million cases of malaria and 429,000 deaths. Almost 90% of cases occur in sub-Saharan Africa (with the remaining 10% in Southeast Asia and South America). Malaria can strike a person multiple times per year, contributing to a major deficit in productivity, depriving families of income, and plunging many into deeper poverty.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many apicomplexan life cycles are quite complex, and&nbsp;<em>Plasmodium</em>&nbsp;is no exception.&nbsp; As you can see, there are many stages in the life cycles of this parasite, and each stage infects a different host or tissue within the host. You do not need to know the details of this life cycle, but you should understand the implications of this complexity in the attempt to develop a cure for malaria.</p> [ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=2483|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=mediasvg]
