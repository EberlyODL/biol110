<h2>Animals I Part 5 VoiceThread Transcript</h2>
<p>Slide 1 We are now ready to look at our first representative of the bilateria. All members of the bilateria are triplobastic and they all show a feature known as cephalization. Cephalization is the concentration of sensory and nervous tissue in a distinct head region (notice that neither the sponges nor the cnidarians have a distinct head). All of the bilateria have a distinct head - at least during certain stages of life.</p>
<p>Slide 2 The bilateria are also divided into either acoelomates, coelomates, or pseudocoelomates. The first group we will look at are the acoelomates - those members of the bilateria that do not have a body cavity.</p>
<p>Slide 3 Our representative group of acoelomates are the Platyhelminthes - also known as the flatworms. This image of a flatworm clearly shows the cephalization that is a feature of the bilateria. We see eyespots at the head end of this organism. This organism also has what is known as an incomplete digestive tract. This means that there is just a single opening into the digestive tract - this structure here known as a pharynx. It serves as both a mouth and an anus. These organisms, like the sponges and cnidarians, are essentially aquatic. However, the aquatic environment they live in may be the fluids inside another organism because the flatworms can be either free-living or parasitic.</p>
<p>Slide 4 Tapeworms are an example of a parasitic flatworm. Tapeworms parasitize the digestive trace of vertebrate animals - including humans. They are specialized for this mode of life - the scolex is a specialized structure for attaching to the intestinal wall of their host. This image shows the suckers and hooks of the scolex. The rest of the worms body is made up of proglottids - specialized reproductive structures that contain both male and female reproductive structures. Tapeworms are very good at removing nutrients from the host organism.</p>
<p>Slide 5 For this reason, they were marketed as a diet aid in the 1900-1920s. While it is true that people who are infected with tapeworms often lose weight - they also lose essential nutrients and can become quite ill. There are better ways to lose weight!</p>
<p>Slide 6 Globally, one of the most important flatworm diseases is schistosoma. This organism infects about 200 million people in 75 countries - mainly in Africa and Asia. It is second only to malaria in prevalence of infectious diseases. Approximately 1 million people die of this infection each year. The worm lives in the blood stream & tissues of the host and is unique among flatworms in that there are separate males and females. In this image you can see a female with a copulatory groove that accommodates a male. They copulate and produce offspring while they float through their hosts blood stream. These organisms have a complex life cycle that involves not just humans but snails as well.</p>
<p>Slide 7 Areas that lack good sanitation often have human fecal material in the water. This can be a source of infection as the eggs pass out of feces and into the water where they hatch and then infect a snail. The larva then emerge from the snail and penetrate a person's skin. Efforts to control this infection involve both improved sanitation as well as snail population control.</p>
<p>Slide 8 You may recognize the freshwater flatworm known as Planaria. It is a common inhabitant of pond water and is often used in biology laboratories.</p>
<p>Slide 9 There are also beautiful marine representatives of this group. Complex life cycle</p>
