<p>In terms of numbers and the diversity of species, Phylum Arthropoda is the most successful group in Kingdom Animalia. Whether one looks on the land, in the air, or under the sea, they will find representatives from this phylum. Over one million&nbsp;<strong>arthropod</strong>&nbsp;species have been described to date; of these, about 400,000 are beetles. Some researchers estimate that the number of arthropod species may exceed 10 million.

</p>
<p>The extreme diversity observed in Phylum Arthropoda can be attributed to three main arthropod characteristics that have evolved into various forms to allow for adaptation to different environments: a hard chitinous exoskeleton, body segmentation, and jointed appendages (the word arthropod means jointed leg)&nbsp;
</p>
<p>The arthropod body is covered by a&nbsp;<strong>cuticle</strong>&nbsp;composed primarily of the polysaccharide chitin (the same polymer used by fungi, as was mentioned in the Fungi I tutorial, but with a harder character; chitin was also described in the tutorial Carbon and Life). In crustaceans, the cuticle includes calcium carbonate, the same mineral used in mollusk shells. This exoskeleton demonstrates several features that are adaptations for life in a terrestrial environment. Its durability protects the animals from physical injury. It also provides structural support to the muscles that move the appendages. Lastly, the cuticle is waterproof and helps prevent desiccation in a dry terrestrial environment; the outer cuticle is covered by a thin layer of wax. One drawback of the exoskeleton is that it confines growth, but arthropods deal with this problem by periodically shedding their exoskeletons in a process known as&nbsp;<strong>molting</strong>. The cuticle also creates a barrier to gas exchange. While aquatic arthropods use gills, terrestrial arthropods “breathe” through a series of small holes in the body, spiracles, that lead to trachea, tubes that carry gases into and out of the tissues

</p>
<p>Arthropods are segmented, and generally there are distinct boundaries between the segments. For example, animals belonging to Class Insecta have three distinct segments: the head, the thorax (sometimes grouped together with the head as the cephalothorax), and the abdomen. The rhinoceros beetle has a cephalothorax and a large abdomen, while an ant has a distinct head and thorax. Typically, these different body regions have distinct functions and often contain various types of&nbsp;<strong>jointed appendages</strong>. Jointed appendages afford the animal with a greater degree of movement. In addition to locomotion, the appendages may be adapted for other functions (e.g., feeding, sensory perception, copulation, and defense).
</p>
<p>Some jointed appendages, such as the swimming appendages of this candy cane shrimp&nbsp;are specialized through adaptation to different and diverse environments.

  <br>This figure&nbsp;shows the body segmentation (cephalothorax and abdomen) and specialized appendages of a representative arthropod, a lobster. In addition to segmentation, arthropods have an open circulatory system; their “blood” and internal organs are contained within a coelem, the hemocoel.

<p>The arthropods are traditionally divided into five subgroups or subphyla: trilobites (an exclusively marine group whose members all are extinct; the fossil record indicates that they were once the dominant subgroup), chelicerates, myriapods, crustaceans, and hexapods. As is the case for many groups of organisms, new molecular datasets are providing additional information on relationships. The groups presented here may change as future molecular data provide a clearer insight into arthropod relationships.
</p>
<p>The majority of modern&nbsp;<strong>chelicerates</strong>&nbsp;(e.g., spiders, scorpions, ticks, and mites) are terrestrial arthropods belonging to Class Arachnida. As with the trilobites, most of the marine chelicerates are extinct, even though a few marine members (e.g., the horseshoe crab, members of a separate class) have survived. The arachnids are best distinguished by their claw-like feeding appendages (chelicerae), from which this subgroup gets its name. Another characteristic of the chelicerates is the presence of two body segments (a cephalothorax and an abdomen). The cephalothorax has six pairs of appendages, including four pairs of walking legs, one pair of chelicerae, and one pair of pedipalps, which have either a feeding or sensory function. Chelicerates lack antennae and have simple eyes.
</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<strong>crustaceans</strong>&nbsp;make up the second largest arthropod subgroup. Extant species are mainly aquatic animals, although some terrestrial species (e.g., pill bugs and wood lice) are classified within this group. Animals in this class include crabs, lobsters, crayfish and shrimp, and they are the only arthropods with two pairs of antennae. Their appendages have two branches at the tips&nbsp;and sometimes the term birame is used to describe members of this group. Segmentation is obvious and extensive in these animals. In contrast to the chelicerates, crustaceans have jaw-like mandibles and compound eyes. The fiddler crab is a typical crustacean.

<p>The myriapods include the centipedes and millipedes. All of the members of this group are terrestrial, and they have long bodies with many segments, although the segments lack specialization. They have a single pair of antennae and usually have simple eyes (Fig. 28).

</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<strong>hexapoda&nbsp;</strong>(“six legs”), the largest extant subgroup, represent so many individual species that this subgroup accounts for the majority of all known (and probably most of the still undiscovered) animal species on the planet. The hexapods have mandibles and compound eyes (as do the crustaceans). Uniquely, they have only one pair of sensory antennae and their appendages are unbranched or uniramous (the name unirames is sometimes used for this group). The hexapods include Class Insecta, with its twenty-six described orders. Insects first appear in the fossil record about 400 million years ago. Insects have three distinct segments (head, thorax, and abdomen). Two pairs of wings and three pairs of legs are typical. Scientists who study insects are called entomologists. Class Insecta is the largest class in the phylum Arthropoda, and their diversity is unmatched in the animal kingdom. Flight evolved independently in this group (what other types of animals can fly?) and is thought to be one factor in the dramatic success of the insects. Why would flight be correlated with species diversity?
