<p>During the course of evolution, prokaryotes have adapted to a myriad of environments. Part of this adaptation involves different ways of obtaining energy and carbon. In looking at the diversity of prokaryotes, one observes many different nutritional modes. When considering nutritional modes, there are some general features that are commonly used to categorize the nutritional state of any organism.</p>
<p>All life can be categorized nutritionally according to how an organism obtains its energy and from where it gets its carbon. The prefixes "chemo" and "photo" are used to describe whether the energy comes from a high-energy molecule (e.g., glucose) or from light, respectively. "Auto" and "hetero" are used to describe whether carbon dioxide or a more complex form of carbon is used as a carbon source, respectively. The prefixes are then affixed to the suffix "troph," meaning nourishment.</p>

<p>Prokaryotes can use carbon in a variety of forms, both as an energy source and as a precursor for anabolic reactions. As you've learned, carbon dioxide is the simplest form of carbon used. Organisms that use this simple form of carbon are often called "carbon fixers".</p>

However, very unusual forms of carbon can also be used by some prokaryotes. For example, some prokaryotes can feed on oil. Although a bane to the oil fields, these oil-eating bacteria have been used to help clean up oil spills.</p>
<p>Some bacteria are capable of using synthetically produced carbon compounds such as TNT (used as an industrial and military explosive) and PCBs (banned substances which are persistent organic pollutants in the environment) as a carbon source. These bacteria metabolize these compounds and produce nontoxic by-products. Humans have exploited this ability by using various species of bacteria for the removal of toxins from the environment; a process known as&nbsp;<strong>bioremediation.</strong>&nbsp;There is an emerging field of civil engineering that utilizes bacteria (along with other eukaryotic microorganisms) for the purpose of cleaning contaminated soils, wells, and river sediments.</p>

<p>The oil tanker the <em>Exxon Valdez</em> ran aground in Alaska's Prince William Sound in the spring of 1989, dumping approximately 11-million gallons of oil. &nbsp; Naturally occurring oil degrading microorganisms played a role in reducing the overall environmental impact of this accident.&nbsp; Bioremediation efforts were used in the <em>Exxon Valdez</em> spill; these efforts included adding fertilizers containing nitrogen to speed up the rates of oil degradation. In 2010, the BP <em>Deepwater Horizon</em> well experienced a leak which led to an explosion that killed 11 people and caused the largest oil spill in U.S. history with an estimated 210-million gallons of oil released into the environment.&nbsp; As with the <em>Exxon Valdez</em>, microorganisms in the environment helped to degrade the oil (although due to the different nature of the spill - fertilizers were not useful in the <em>Deepwater Horizon</em> spill).&nbsp; &nbsp; Photo source: Office of Response and Restoration, National Ocean Service, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration</p><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="450" src="https://voicethread.com/app/player/?threadId=2128111" width="800"></iframe>
