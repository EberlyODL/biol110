<p>Crossing-over in meiosis is typically described as a random event and for genes that&nbsp;reside on most areas of the chromosomes this is a true statement. However, it is observed&nbsp;that the crossing-over process becomes suppressed as one examines genes that lie&nbsp;progressively closer to the centromere (i.e., that region of the chromosome where sister&nbsp;chromatids remain attached until the onset of Anaphase II). Consider four genes in a heterozygotous state that lie on the same chromosome prior to the onset of&nbsp;meiosis.</p>
<ul><li>If you examine the gametes of individuals having this arrangement, would you&nbsp;expect to see a higher proportion of gametes with AB compared to CD? Why or&nbsp;why not?</li><li>If a cross-over takes place at the location indicated with an arrow, what are the&nbsp;possible gametes that can be produced?</li></ul>
