<p>The concept of natural selection is sometimes oversimplified as "survival of the fittest". However, there are many different ways that natural selection can influence the composition of a population.&nbsp; When selection acts on reproductively isolated populations it is possible for speciation to occur and form new species.&nbsp; Evolutionary biologists are still debating about how to accurately define a species. As you will learn, the problem is that not all definitions work in every situation (and perhaps this statement itself provides insight into the diversity of life). We will explore a variety of species concepts.&nbsp; By the end of the tutorial you should have a basic understanding of:</p>
<ul><li>The major modes of natural selection</li><li>Why sexual selection &nbsp;is a special case of natural selection, selecting for features than enhance reproductive success but may hinder individual survival</li><li>The three major species concepts</li><li>The difference between prezygotic and postzygotic reproductive isolation, and how both keep species distinct</li><li>The conditions that favor speciation</li><li>The distinction between allopatric and sympatric speciation</li></ul>
<p>Performance Objectives</p>
<ul><li>Summarize the role of natural selection as an adaptive evolutionary force, and describe the results of different types of selection on a population</li><li>Explain stabilizing selection and why it results in a loss of genetic variation in a population.</li><li>Describe directional selection and how it can lead to both genotypic and phenotypic change in a population.</li><li>Diagram diversifying selection and why it can lead to multiple genotypes and phenotypes in a population.</li><li>Compare and contrast intra and inter-sexual selection.</li><li>Explain how frequency dependent selection and heterozygote advantage are both types of balancing selection.</li><li>Compare and contrast the biological, morphological and phylogenetic species concepts</li><li>Describe the ways that reproductive isolation can be maintained, both prezygotic and postzygotic</li><li>Describe&nbsp;the conditions required for allopatric speciation to occur</li><li>Explain how polyploidy can lead to sympatric speciation</li><li>Summarize the process of adaptive radiation and why it is often seen in organisms that live on island groups.</li></ul>
