<p>This tutorial began our discussion of Kingdom Animalia. Animals have been around for over a billion years, and during this time they have diversified to a remarkable degree. The ancestor of all animals was most likely a colonial protest similar to a choanoflagellate. In examining the animal phylogenetic tree, keep in mind that there are major dichotomous characters that occur at each branch point, including the presence of tissues, the number of tissue layers, and the symmetry of the organism. In&nbsp;some cases&nbsp;these characters are based on the development of animals.</p><p>Eumetazoan development (as with other sexually reproducing, multicellular eukaryotes) begins with fertilization. The zygote then undergoes a series of cell divisions to produce a mass of cells that has some hollow character (the parazoans do not follow this type of embryology). The first tissue to form is the blastoderm, and this young tissue surrounds the blastocoel. In the next step (gastrulation), cells migrate inward and begin to differentiate into endoderm. Thus, gastrulation marks the embryonic stage where additional tissue types form. In the case of diploblastic animals, there are only two tissue types (ectoderm and endoderm), whereas triploblastic animals have three tissue types (ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm). During gastrulation, the primitive gut also forms from the archenteron. Hox genes are found in all animals and determine the patterning of the body during development.</p><p>As we survey the various phyla of Kingdom Animalia, keep in mind the relationship between these major characters and animal development. This tutorial examined the early branches in the Kingdom Animalia. Be sure that you understand the rationale behind the taxonomic scheme for animals. For example, it is important for you to know what a coelomate is, what the coelom represents, and how the coelom arises.</p><p>The Phylum Porifera was discussed. These animals can be considered individuals and colonies because they have features of both. In fact, there are some biologists who argue that they really aren't animals; however, they do have animal characteristics (they are multicellular, motile, ingestive heterotrophs), which is why they are placed in the kingdom Animalia.</p><p>Phylum Cnidaria is comprised of simple animals, including jellies and corals. These animals do have true tissues, however, they possess only two embryonic tissues; hence, they have a diploblastic mode of development. The major body forms observed in this phylum are the polyp and the medusa. In many cnidarians, these forms alternate during the life cycle, but in Class Hydrozoa the polyp is prominent, whereas in Class Scyphozoa the medusa is prominent. Members of Class Anthozoa do not have a medusa stage (this class includes the coral reef-building animals that form symbioses with dinoflagellates). Think about these differences in terms of evolution because small changes in the expression of developmental genes can control when, and for how long, a given form is represented. Within Phylum Cnidaria, there are differences in the timing of the polyp versus the medusa stage.</p><p>The bilateria were introduced in this tutorial. Keep in mind, the character trait bilateral symmetry is observed in animals that actively move through their environments. Bilaterally symmetrical animals not only have a single plane of symmetry, their sensory and cephalic areas are usually cephalized, placed toward the anterior part of the animal. Bilateral animals can be characterized as lacking a body cavity (acoelomates). Those that have a body cavity, coelom, may have one that is incompletely lined with mesoderm (pseudocoelomates), or one that is completely lined with mesoderm (coelomates).</p><p>The Phylum Platyhelminthes is composed of animals that are commonly referred to as flatworms. These animals are triploblastic and show an organ level of complexity. Although many members of this phylum are free-living, some are parasitic and cause major health problems in some parts of the world.</p>
