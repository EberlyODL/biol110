<p>Each chromatid has a centromere; therefore, in metaphase, the back-and-forth jostling results in chromosomes that are not only lined up in a single plane, but each sister chromatid is aligned opposite one another. This arrangement is well suited for accurate partitioning of the chromatid.
</p>
<p>Once the cell senses proper alignment along the metaphase plate, the replicated chromatids separate rapidly, signifying&nbsp;<strong>anaphase</strong>. Two notable things happen during anaphase: first, the centromeres that hold the chromatids together dissolve, separating the chromatids from each other; and second, the newly freed chromatids (now properly called chromosomes) move rapidly toward the poles.&nbsp; This image shows a cell in anaphase.&nbsp; The separated chromatids (now chromosomes) are stained blue and the fibers that pull the chromosomes to each pole of the cell are stained green.
