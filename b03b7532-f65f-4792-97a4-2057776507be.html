<p>The inheritance of traits is due to the transmission of&nbsp;<strong>genes </strong>from parents to offspring, and these genes code for the physical similarities that we observe. A gene is a heritable unit that codes for the production of a protein. In cells, nuclear DNA is organized into chromosomes. Genes occupy specific positions on chromosomes. More than one form of a gene may exist, and these alternative forms of the gene (<strong>alleles</strong>)result in the formation of slightly different proteins and enzymes that result in differences between individuals (for example, in physical appearance or physiological functioning).</p>
<p>By passing chromosomes from parents to offspring, genes are transmitted from one generation to the next resulting in similarities between parents and offspring. All organisms have their genetic material organized into chromosomes, although the number of chromosomes differs by species (e.g., humans have 46 chromosomes, dogs have 78, cats have 34, and mosquitoes have only 6). Regardless of the number of chromosomes, the underlying principles of inheritance are the same for all species.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In humans, any cell that is not a sperm or egg contains 46 chromosomes. These 46 chromosomes occur as 23 pairs of chromosomes, and the two chromosomes in a pair are identical in length and shape (except in males, who have one pair of nonidentical chromosomes: an X and a Y chromosome).&nbsp; This image is a human&nbsp;<strong>karyotype</strong>&nbsp;- an image of the 46 human chromosomes arranged into pairs.&nbsp; Is this karyotype from a male or a female?&nbsp; The two chromosomes in the pair also have the same genes; if a gene for hair color is located at one location on one chromosome (commonly referred to as a locus; plural, loci), its&nbsp;<strong>homologous chromosome</strong>&nbsp;will have the hair color gene at the same location. Importantly, the homologs may or may not have the same allele for the gene. This is because one homolog comes from each parent.</p>
