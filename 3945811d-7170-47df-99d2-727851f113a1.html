<p>The bananas you buy in the grocery store are seedless and sterile â€“ they do not reproduce sexually (plant breeders produce them through asexual propagation methods).&nbsp; Some scientists are concerned that a common disease of bananas, Black Sigatoka fungus, may wipe out most bananas in the world and they would no longer be a readily available food&nbsp; (in many parts of the world, bananas are a staple food crop).

<ul><li>Why are bananas more susceptible to being wiped out than a food crop that reproduces sexually?</li><li>Specifically, what aspects of sexual reproduction produce genetic variation?</li>
