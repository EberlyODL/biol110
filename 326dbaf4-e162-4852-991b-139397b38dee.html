<p>The first phase of mitosis,&nbsp;<strong>prophase</strong>, is marked by the condensation of chromosomes. During interphase, DNA is replicated and the replicated chromosomes remain relatively stretched out. It is difficult to visualize individual chromosomes prior to prophase using standard microscopy. This changes once the cell progresses into G<sub>2</sub>.

<p>The chromosomes begin to condense at some point during G<sub>2</sub>. In this complex process, each replicated elongated chromosome becomes supercoiled and, as a result, becomes considerably shorter and more tightly packed (the replicated chromosome shown in the image above). Each replicated chromosome is only a few microns long, and by the end of prophase appears as two replicated, identical&nbsp;<strong>chromatids</strong>&nbsp;attached at the&nbsp;<strong>centromere</strong>&nbsp;(a condensed area found on all eukaryotic chromosomes). It is important to consider the significance of chromosome condensation; a highly compacted chromosome is easier to move than a stretched-out one. Moreover, chromosomes will physically be moved around in the cell later. If the DNA were stretched out, it would be subject to physical shearing. In the condensed form, it is less prone to physical damage.
