<p>This tutorial focused on basic biochemistry. Many of life's chemical processes involve the synthesis of larger molecules from smaller building blocks, in an event that is generally termed anabolism. These larger molecules can then be broken down in a process that is termed catabolism. Later in the course we will examine some specific anabolic events and how they contribute to the life of a growing organism. We will also examine how catabolic events can be used to convert energy that is necessary to sustain life. To understand these biochemical events, it is important to know some basic chemistry.</p>
<p>Our bodies are comprised of over 70% water. All life on the planet depends on this molecule, and you should be aware of the polar character of this molecule and how polarity affects the ability of one water molecule to interact with another water molecule, as well as with other polar molecules. Water is an excellent solvent and is capable of dissolving a variety of polar molecules. A molecule that can readily interact with water is a hydrophilic molecule, and one that does not interact with water is a hydrophobic molecule. Not all molecules have a strictly hydrophilic/hydrophobic character; some have both and are termed amphipathic.</p>
<p>Carbon is a very important element for life. Due to its chemical versatility, it is found in thousands of compounds within living organisms. To understand biochemistry, you need to have a fundamental understanding of the major classes of molecules that are composed of carbon. Additionally, it is important to understand the relationship between these carbon-containing molecules and water.</p>
<p>Lipids are a class of carbon-containing molecules that have a hydrophobic character. They either totally lack any polar characteristics or their polar character is limited to a small area of the molecule. Be sure that you understand how the polar character of a molecule influences its ability to interact with water. Fats are lipids that are solid at room temperature and that do not readily interact with water. On the other hand, oils are lipids that are liquid at room and that do not readily interact with water. Phospholipids are a class of lipids that have amphipathic properties, and they are a major component of cellular membranes.</p>
<p>Carbohydrates are another class of carbon-bearing molecules, and they are used by the cell for energy storage and as structural molecules. Later in the course you will learn how energy is extracted from monosaccharides in the processes of glycolysis and cellular respiration. Carbohydrates are also found as polysaccharides, which are involved in energy storage and in building various cellular components.</p>
<p>Proteins are composed of amino acids (there are twenty naturally occurring amino acids), and these subunits are linked together to form polypeptide chains. A protein may be comprised of a single polypeptide chain (which is encoded by a single gene), or it may be comprised of two or more polypeptides (each polypeptide chain may be encoded for by a separate gene). Proteins play a variety of roles within the living organism. They can catalyze various chemical reactions (catabolic and anabolic), and they can form structural elements. Additionally, some proteins can convert chemical energy into mechanical energy; such proteins are involved in various motor activities within organisms.</p>
