<h2>Fungi II Part 2 VoiceThread Transcript</h2>
<p>Slide 1</p>
<p>Phylum Basidiomycota includes the classic mushrooms, puffballs, and shelf fungi&nbsp;</p>
<p>They are important decomposers in forest ecosystems because they digest cellulose and lignin.</p>
<p>This is a monophyletic group and this group includes some important plant pathogens known as the&nbsp; rusts, smuts</p>
<p>Some members of this group are also Mycorrhizae.</p>
<p>The life cycle of this group is characterized by basidia which are&nbsp; club-shaped structures that house the sexual spores.</p>
<p>Slide 2</p>
<p>The basidiomycete sexual life cycle shows karyogamy, plasmogamy, and the formation of the dikaryon.</p>
<p>Two individuals of opposite mating type fuse together during plasmogamy to form the dikaryon - in this group the dikaryon is the basidium.</p>
<p>Within the dikaryon, karyogamy takes place to produce the diploid stage.</p>
<p>The diploid cells undergo meiosis to produce haploid spores.&nbsp; These spores are then released from the parent fungus to start the new generation.</p>
<p>Slide 3</p>
<p>Important members of this group include the rusts and smuts - diseases that affect plants.</p>
<p>Wheat rust, for example,&nbsp; can reduce wheat yields up to 40% and are economically important for this reason.</p>
<p>Cedar apple rust is a disease that over winters on cedar trees and then infects apples and related species.</p>
<p>Corn smut is a basidiomycete disease that reduces corn yields - it is however, an edible fungus and is eaten in Mexico where it is called cuitlacoche. &nbsp;</p>
