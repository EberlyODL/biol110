<p>In the "Real Life Example" in the tutorial "Life and Natural Selection", you were introduced to the Evolution Canyons in Israel (review this example from&nbsp; the tutorial if you do not recall the information). Researchers are interested in a variety of organisms’ responses to the extreme environmental differences between the south-facing (“African”) and north-facing (“European”) slopes of the Evolution Canyons.

<p>One team of researchers is looking at evolutionary responses in a common soil bacterium&nbsp;<em>Bacillus subtilis</em>&nbsp;in the Evolutionary Canyons.&nbsp;<em>B. subtilis</em>&nbsp;is a good choice of organism for this research because it is a common model organism that has been used to study prokaryote genetics and the process of DNA replication in prokaryotes in laboratory settings and thus a great deal is already known about the organisms’ genetics.
</p>
<p>Some of the team’s research findings include that the&nbsp;<em>B. subtilis</em>&nbsp;that live on the south-facing slopes are more efficient at producing biological molecules (“biosynthesis”) than those that live on the north-facing slope (Nevo, 2009).
</p>
<ul><li>Based on the genus name (<em>Bacillus</em>), what shape is this bacterium? Is it a member of domain Archaea or domain Bacteria?</li><li>What is a model organism (you will need to look this up in an outside source)?</li><li>Develop a plausible hypothesis for why bacteria living on the south-facing slopes have more efficient biosynthesis than those living on the north-facing slopes.</li>
</ul>
