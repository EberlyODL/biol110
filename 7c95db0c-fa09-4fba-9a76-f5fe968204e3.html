<p>The title of this course is <em>Concepts of Biology and Biodiversity</em>. Biological<strong> evolution</strong> (defined most succinctly as changes in the genetic structure of a population) is an important process in biology, and it explains the diversity of life that exists in our world (the images below show the evolution of major life forms through geologic time). We now know that all life is related and can be traced back to a common ancestor that existed approximately 3.7 billion years ago. In the vast time since life first appeared, evolution has resulted in a continuous branching of new species that can be described as a tree of life. Rooted firmly at the bottom is life's common ancestor, whereas modern species reside at the tree's tips; the vast branching that exists between the two describes the history of life on the planet.</p>
<p>In this class, evolution will be a reoccurring theme. Whenever appropriate, we will discuss how evolutionary processes have shaped life's diversity and <strong>adaptations</strong> (adaptations are traits that help an organism survive in its current environment). As you will learn, evolution has many facets that have contributed to the diversity of life. However, only one process adapts life to the environment; this process is natural selection.</p>

<h3>What is Natural Selection?</h3>
<p><strong>Natural selection</strong> is a process by which a population becomes better adapted to its' environment over time (a more succinct definition of natural selection is “differential reproduction” – the best adapted individuals are more likely to reproduce then less well adapted individuals).&nbsp; However, environments are always changing and thus the adaptations in an environment also change.&nbsp; Changing environments drive evolution via natural selection.</p>
<p>At the most fundamental level, natural selection results in changes in the frequency of certain genes and/or alleles over successive generations within a population. In order for natural selection to act on a population, there must be genetic variation in the population and the genes and alleles that are selected for are the ones that result in adaptation.&nbsp; As you might gather, genetics and genetic diversity play an important role in understanding natural selection and this course will include a study of genetics.</p>
