<p>Numerous concepts have been proposed to define a species, however, only three concepts will be described in this tutorial. None are perfect, but the biological species concept is the most easily applicable to sexually reproducing organisms.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<strong>biological species concept</strong>&nbsp;defines a species as a group of individuals who interbreed, or have the potential to interbreed, in nature. Notice that this definition is very similar to the definition of a population. Remember that evolution works at the population level. According to the biological species concept, when individuals of a population become sufficiently different, so as to lose the capacity to interbreed, then a new species has arisen. However, this definition is not very useful for those that do not undergo sexual reproduction. It also is not useful in defining groups that are extinct, and can prove problematic in defining groups of bacteria that undergo conjugation (the exchange of small amounts of genetic information).</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<strong>morphological species concept</strong>&nbsp;(also sometimes called the typological species concept) defines a species as a group of organisms that are consistently and persistently distinct from other groups of organisms and distinguishable by their morphology (shape). &nbsp;In other words, if they appear different, then they are different species. The advantage of this definition is that it works for extinct species and for those that reproduce asexually. However, it can be insufficient. For example, if you were not familiar with dogs and came upon a group of Chihuahua dogs, you might define dogs as "small, four-legged, warm-blooded animals with prominent canine teeth." If you then came upon a group of Great Danes, you could easily classify them as a second species due to their large size.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<strong>evolutionary species concept</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;groups organisms based on shared (unique) evolutionary history; the smallest group of organisms that share a common ancestor and can be distinguished form other groups that do not, essentially an evolutionary unit.&nbsp; According to this definition, two species might actually be able to interbreed, yet because they have different evolutionary histories they are considered different species. Also, this species concept results in more species being recognized, because if two populations have the potential to interbreed but donâ€™t because of their geographic location, they are considered to be different species. As you have probably realized, it can be difficult to establish at what point genetically distinct populations become their own species, and in some cases the designation of a species can be somewhat arbitrary.</p>
<p>Most biologists use the biological species concept when it is practical; when not, they turn to one of the other concepts, although with the availability of genetic information for many populations, the evolutionary species concept is becoming more widely used.</p>
