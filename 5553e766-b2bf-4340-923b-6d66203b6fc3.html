<p>Each time a cell divides, it must replicate its DNA. The replication of DNA takes place during the S-phase of the cell cycle&nbsp;and results in a chromosome that is comprised of two identical sister chromatids. DNA replication can be divided into several stages. The DNA double helix unwinds and nitrogenous bases (A,T,G or C) are added to each strand of the parent molecule (but only onto one end of each), resulting in two identical copies of the original parent strands.</p>

<p>DNA replication is termed <strong>semiconservative</strong>&nbsp;<strong>replication</strong> because each newly formed molecule of DNA has one strand conserved from the parent molecule and one newly synthesized strand.</p>
<p>This is an animation of an overview of DNA replication: <dnareplication-overview></dnareplication-overview></p>
<p>Along a strand of DNA, replication begins at numerous&nbsp;<strong>origins of replication</strong>. There are several enzymes involved in the process of DNA replication.&nbsp;<strong>Helicases</strong>&nbsp;unwind the DNA double helix,&nbsp;<strong>single-strand binding proteins</strong>&nbsp;keep the strands separate while&nbsp;<strong>primases</strong>&nbsp;initiate replication, and&nbsp;<strong>DNA polymerase&nbsp;</strong>adds nucleotides to the unwound parent molecule. While the fundamentals of replication are simple, there is a feature of DNA structure that makes things a bit more complicated; the strands have opposite chemical polarities. This can be hard to comprehend because the strands seem identical. However, a close inspection reveals that the H-bonding that occurs between bases is only achieved if the strands have opposite polarities. This arrangement of strands is&nbsp;<strong>antiparallel</strong>, with one strand designated the 3'-to-5' strand and the other the 5'-to-3' strand.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<br>DNA polymerase has an important limitation - it can&nbsp;<u>only</u>&nbsp;add nucleotides to the 3' end of the newly synthesized strand of DNA. Therefore, nucleotide addition is a smooth, continuous process along one of the strands (the&nbsp;<strong>leading strand</strong>) of DNA. The other strand (the&nbsp;<strong>lagging strand</strong>) has a discontinuous mode of replication because DNA polymerase can only work by starting from the&nbsp;<strong>replication fork</strong>(where DNA is unwinding) and progressing outward (until it runs into a previously synthesized fragment). An added wrinkle to the process on the lagging strand is created by the lack of a continuous new strand; DNA polymerase can only add nucleotides to an existing 3' nucleotide. How is this lagging strand started? Primase has the ability to synthesize a short&nbsp;<strong>primer</strong>&nbsp;made of a few nucleotides of RNA. DNA polymerase can then add DNA nucleotides to the end of this primer sequence and synthesize relatively short stretches of DNA known as&nbsp;<strong>Okazaki fragments</strong>. An additional enzyme (<strong>ligase</strong>) seals the fragments into a continuous strand of DNA. The figure above&nbsp;provides an overview of the enzymes involved, antiparallelism, and the overall direction of DNA replication. All of this takes place in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells (cells that have membrane-bound nuclei and organelles). Be sure that you study this figure carefully. You could see this figure unlabeled and be asked to name the enzymes and their functions on an exam.</p>
