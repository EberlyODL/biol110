<h3 id="FromGenetoProtein-IntroductionandLearningObjectives">Introduction and Learning Objectives</h3>
<p>In the previous tutorial you learned about how DNA is replicated. &nbsp;In this tutorial you will learn how DNA codes for the production of proteins. &nbsp;By the end of the tutorial you should have a basic understanding of:</p>
<ul><li>RNA transcription</li><li>Protein translation</li><li>Mutations</li></ul>
<p>Performance Objectives:</p>
<ul><li>Describe the process of transcription, including the molecules and enzymes that are needed &nbsp;</li><li>Interpret the genetic code table and state the properties of the genetic code &nbsp;</li><li>Explain the phenomenon of gene expression &nbsp;</li><li>Summarize the process of translation, including the molecules that are needed</li><li>Describe how mutations in the DNA can affect the polypeptide produced</li></ul>
