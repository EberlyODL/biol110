<p>The Eberly College of Science Code of Mutual Respect and Cooperation pertains to all members of the college community; faculty, staff, and students.</p>
<p>The <a class="ext" href="http://www.science.psu.edu/climate/Code-of-Mutual-Respect%20final.pdf" target="_blank" title="Code of Mutual Respect and Cooperation">Code of Mutual Respect and Cooperation</a> was developed to embody the values that we hope our faculty, staff, and students possess, consistent with the aspirational goals expressed in the Penn State Principles. The University is strongly committed to freedom of expression, and consequently, the Code does not constitute University or College policy, and is not intended to interfere in any way with an individual&rsquo;s academic or personal freedoms. We hope, however, that individuals will voluntarily endorse the 12 principles set forth in the Code, thereby helping us make the Eberly College of Science a place where every individual feels respected and valued, as well as challenged and rewarded.</p>
<h5>The 12 Principles of the Code are:</h5>
