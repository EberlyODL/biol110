<p><strong>Stramenopiles</strong> are a diverse, monophyletic group.&nbsp; The group includes: planktonic diatoms, small single-celled or colonial freshwater protists (golden algae), large multicellular marine seaweeds (brown algae), and water molds.&nbsp; The water molds include the organism responsible for the potato blight that caused a famine in Ireland where a million people died and a million people emigrated to other countries in the nineteenth century. Although this group is diverse, they all share a common characteristic, the presence of hair-like projections on their flagella.&nbsp; This group is named for these projections; "stramen" means flagellum in Latin, and "pilos" means hair; hence, stramenopilans.</p>

<p clear="">Diatoms are an important component of the global carbon cycle. Marine and freshwater plankton are full of photosynthetic diatoms. Some estimates suggest that they may be responsible for over 20% of annual global carbon fixation.&nbsp;<strong>Diatoms</strong>&nbsp;are encased in a glass-like&nbsp;<strong>silica</strong>&nbsp;shell, lined with perforations to allow gas exchange at the cell surface. These shells, &nbsp;are exceptionally beautiful structures. Each one consists of two components that fit together, like the bottom and lid of a pillbox. After the death of individual diatoms, their microscopic shells sink and gradually form thick layers of sediment (diatomaceous earth). Living diatoms avoid sinking by regulating their cellular ion concentrations.</p>[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=2504|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__left__lightboxed]
<p>Diatomaceous earth, which essentially consists of microscopic fragments of glass from these silica shells, has numerous applications. For example, it is commonly used as a pesticide; the sharp edges of diatom shells scrape arthropod exoskeletons and gut linings, causing water loss and eventually death by desiccation. It also damages the tissues of worms and other small creatures, and often is incorporated into animal feed to reduce the occurrence of intestinal parasites. It has myriad other uses (e.g., giving scouring power to cleaning products, and allowing ultrafine filtration for scientific applications and water-purification systems).</p>
<p>[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=2503|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__right__lightboxed]</p>
<p>Silica shells are fairly inert, and diatomaceous earth tends to stay where it settles. Therefore, scientists can look at the assemblages of diatom species in soil cores, where the deepest layers of the sample are the oldest and represent the most distant past. They can date the samples and examine changes in the number of warm-climate diatom species and cool-climate species over time, gaining clues about ancient climatic patterns. Actually, it is not quite this simple. Other factors, besides temperature, can influence the diatom species found, and sometimes scientists do not know the temperature preferences of extinct diatom species discovered in samples.</p>
<p>Diatoms are mostly photosynthetic, but there are also heterotrophic species.</p>

<p><strong>Chrysophytes</strong> are planktonic, mainly freshwater organisms that are golden in color due to specific pigments. These different pigments allow them to expand the range of light wavelengths they can use during photosynthesis. Many golden algae are predators (as well as being photoautotrophic), using&nbsp;pseudopodia&nbsp;(cytoplasmic "feet") to prey on smaller organisms, including diatoms and bacteria. Some possess silica scales, similar in composition to the shells of diatoms; silica also coats the quiescent cysts that form under unfavorable conditions, allowing chrysophytes to remain dormant for decades. Most chrysophytes are unicellular, but some species are colonial and elaborate in structure (e.g.,&nbsp;<em>Synura</em>&nbsp;sp. Colony) .&nbsp; Chrysophytes can have population explosions, similar to those in dinoflagellates (HABs).&nbsp; These “golden tides” have result in large fish kills in some freshwater environments.</p>

<h3 id="ProtistsII-KingdomsStramenopila,Rhodophyta,Chlorophyta,andtheSlimeMolds-ARealLifeExample:Diatomsandsymbioses">Kingdom Stramenopila: Phylum Oomycota</h3>
<p><strong>Oomycetes</strong> include the water molds and downy mildews. Some are unicellular, while others are colonial. Most are heterotrophic decomposers that feed on dead and decaying organic matter in aquatic and terrestrial environments, but some attack living plants and animals. The name "oomycete" means "egg fungi," which is a reference to the reproductive structures of sexually reproducing oomycetes.</p>
<p>[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=2516|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__left__lightboxed]</p>
<p>Although oomycetes are not closely related to fungi, the two groups have some similarities. In particular, both groups are heterotrophs that break down food externally and then absorb nutrients from their surroundings. Additionally, many of the multicellular oomycetes form&nbsp;hyphae, which are very similar to fungal hyphae although the structures are not identical.</p>
<p>[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=2510|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__right__lightboxed]</p>
<p></p>
<p>However, there are more differences than similarities. For example, the cell walls of oomycetes are composed of cellulose, not chitin (the compound found in the cell walls of fungi). Unlike true fungi, which are haploid in the feeding stage (and the majority of their life cycle), the hyphae of oomycetes are composed of diploid cells.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The resemblance between fungi and oomycetes is an example of&nbsp;<strong>convergent evolution</strong>, the process by which unrelated organisms that occupy similar environments evolve similar functional traits. For example, oomycetes and fungi are decomposers and therefore stand to gain an advantage from maximizing their surface area for the absorption of food; thus, the filamentous growth form would have been favored by selection and therefore evolved independently in both lineages.</p>
<p>Oomycetes have been responsible for a number of catastrophic historic events, including the outbreak of downy mildew that nearly wiped out the French wine industry in the late nineteenth century.&nbsp;<em>Plasmopara</em>, a native of the New World, was inadvertently brought to France from the United States in 1870 in a shipment of American grape root stock. It quickly became a devastating problem. A mixture of lime and copper sulfate, the first chemicals used to combat a plant pathogen, successfully treated grapes affected by this organism.</p>

<p>The oomycete&nbsp;<em>Phytophthora infestans</em>, or potato blight, was responsible for another cataclysmic event, the Great Potato Famine, which killed nearly one-million people in Ireland in the late 1800s, and drove one million more out of the country.&nbsp;<em>Phytophthora</em> secretes enzymes that break down leaf and stem tissue which kills plants rapidly. Tubers can become infested, turning soft and black, seemingly overnight. Potato fields in Ireland became infested with&nbsp;<em>Phytophthora</em>, which thrived in the cool damp climate of Ireland and wiped out nearly the entire country's crop in one week. In nineteenth-century Ireland, potatoes were the primary food source of the poorest classes, who often grew nothing other than potatoes. The loss of this staple crop led to mass starvation.</p>

<p><strong>Phaeophytes</strong>, or brown algae, include the largest of the protists, with some growing over 100 feet in length. The giant multicellular species that comprise "kelp forests" in temperate marine waters belong to this group. The edible alga "kombu," which is harvested by the Japanese, is also a phaeophyte. It is particularly rich in minerals, as are other marine algae. Like the chrysophytes, phaeophytes contain specific accessory pigments that give them their characteristic colors.</p>

<p>Along with the two kingdoms that we will discuss next, Rhodophyta and Chlorophyta, Phylum Phaeophyta includes a number of&nbsp;<strong>seaweeds</strong>. Although it is not a taxonomic term, the word "seaweed" is a useful way of distinguishing large intertidal algae from other species (e.g., planktonic algae). Many types of seaweed, including those within the Phylum Phaeophyta, have complex structures that are reminiscent of plants. The&nbsp;<strong>thallus</strong>&nbsp;refers to the entire body of any seaweed that is plant-like in appearance. The thallus consists of three main parts: a&nbsp;<strong>stipe</strong>, which is analogous to the stem of plants; a&nbsp;<strong>holdfast</strong>, which secures the seaweed to a substrate; and leaf-like&nbsp;<strong>blades</strong>, which provide extensive surface area for photosynthesis, much as leaves do for plants.</p>
<p>[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=2509|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__lightboxed]</p>
<p>Another word used informally to describe a specific type of alga is "<strong>kelp</strong>," which refers to giant seaweeds that grow in the deeper waters outside of the intertidal zone. All kelps, which form vast "forests" that support thriving marine ecosystems, are phaeophytes. As one can see, these organisms can reach very impressive sizes.&nbsp;</p>
