<p>Cell division is a precisely regulated process. Although&nbsp;<strong>mitosis</strong>&nbsp;is a process by which eukaryotic cell division occurs (remember, eukaryotic cells can also divide via meiosis - a process you will learn about in the next tutorial), many events need to take place prior to the physical separation of a mother cell into two daughter cells. Mitosis is a highly orchestrated process, with many checkpoints that insure events occur in the proper sequence. However, cells only divide at certain times and in specific situations.</p>

<p>All of the components of a cell must be replicated prior to cell division (only a fraction of the components are shown in this figure of an animal cell). The replication of new components is highly regulated. Only if the cell receives the proper signal (the nature of which is dependent on the particular cell and the environment in which it exists), will events be set in motion that lead to cell division. As long as the signal is present, the cells will continue to divide in a cyclical process known as the&nbsp;<strong>cell cycle</strong>.</p>
<p>[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3017|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__left__lightboxed]The cell cycle is a continuous process, but to make it easier to study it can be broken down into four phases. The&nbsp;<strong>M phase</strong>&nbsp;is the mitotic phase. The other three phases are collectively known as&nbsp;<strong>interphase</strong>. The three phases of interphase following mitosis are: the the&nbsp;<strong>G</strong><strong><sub>1</sub></strong>&nbsp;growth phase, the&nbsp;<strong>S phase</strong>&nbsp;or synthesis phase, which is when DNA is replicated, and the&nbsp;<strong>G</strong><strong><sub>2</sub></strong>growth phase. Although the synthesis of nuclear DNA is restricted to the S phase, replication of cellular components can occur throughout the cell cycle (mostly being limited to G<sub>1</sub>, S, and G<sub>2</sub>).</p>
