<p>Plant breeders have used variations in crop plants to select for improved varieties without really understanding the fundamentals of genetics. They simply crossed individuals that had the most favorable traits. The science of modern genetics is rooted in the work of Gregor Mendel, who was the first to carefully document the behavior of traits between successive generations. Mendel did not know about chromosomes or alleles, yet his observations predicted their existence. His careful analyses of monohybrid crosses allowed him to deduce that traits may skip a generation, depending on whether or not they are recessive (i.e., heterozygous recessive alleles are not expressed). In other words, he was able to infer the genetic composition (the genotype) by carefully observing the pattern of the observed character trait&nbsp;(the phenotype) between successive generations.</p>
<p>We now know that the reason for the particular pattern of phenotypic expression in the F<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;generation is because of the behavior of chromosomes during meiosis in the F<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;generation. Be sure that you understand how the segregation of chromosomes in meiosis provides a mechanism to account for the segregation frequencies observed in the F<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;generation.</p>
<p>Since the work of Mendel, we have learned a tremendous amount about genetics. Not only do we understand why Mendel observed the frequencies that he did in the different generations, the molecular events that relate the genotype directly to the phenotype are also understood.</p>
