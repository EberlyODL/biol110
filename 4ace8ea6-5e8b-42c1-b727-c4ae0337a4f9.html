<h2>Animals III Part 1 VoiceThread Transcript</h2>
<p>Slide 1 Our first group of deuterostome animals are the echinoderms - represented by the sea stars and sea urchins. It may seem odd - but this group of organisms is most closely related to us than any group we have discussed thus far. We recognize the close evolutionary relatedness because we share a deuterstome mode of development.</p>
<p>Slide 2 Phylum echinodermata consists of the sea stars, sea urchins, sea cucumbers, brittle stars, and feather stars. Notice that as adults these organisms have a radial symmetry - but they are members of the bilateria. While they are radial as adults - they are bilateral as larvae. This group of organisms has an endoskeleton and a unique mode of motility involving a water vascular system and tube feet. The water vascular system is a system of canals filled with fluid that connect to the tube feet. The tube feet use hydraulic pressue to expand and contract and move the animal along the sea floor.</p>
<p>Slide 3 This is an exclusively marine group - so while they have evolutionary advanced characters they are still dependent on an aquatic environment.</p>
