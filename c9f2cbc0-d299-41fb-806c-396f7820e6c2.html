<p>A defining feature of&nbsp;<strong>prokaryotes</strong>&nbsp;is their lack of membrane-bound nuclei. This is not to say they lack subcellular specialization because some prokaryotes have very elaborate internal membranes. However, they generally have less subcellular specialization than&nbsp;<strong>eukaryotes </strong>(organisms with membrane-bound nuclei and organelles). Also, prokaryotes are usually smaller than eukaryotic cells (1-5 microns compared to 10-100 microns). Prokaryotes are often described as being "simple" but this is not an accurate description of the prokaryotes.&nbsp; While they tend to have a more basic structure than eukaryotes, in other ways they are more complex.&nbsp; For example, prokaryotes are capable of more diverse metabolic and nutritional pathways than eukaryotes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Prokaryotes are often described as single-celled organisms, but they can form colonies that show a remarkable level of complexity (as depicted in this colorized image of a bacterial colony). The shape of individual cells is used to classify prokaryotes; they can be either spherical (<strong>coccus</strong>), rod-shaped (<strong>bacillus</strong>), or helical (<strong>spirillum</strong>).</p>
<p>This animation is a simple game to test your understanding of the basic features of a prokaryote.&nbsp;</p>
