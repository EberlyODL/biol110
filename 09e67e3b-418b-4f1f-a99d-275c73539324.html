<h2>Plants I Part 2 VoiceThread Transcript</h2><p>Slide 1</p><p>There are challenges to living on land. &nbsp;Life evolved in the water and so the move to a terrestrial environment could not happen until organisms developed adaptations that allowed them to deal with land's challenges.</p><p>For plants, two of the most important challenges are that land is dry and that land is not buoyant.</p><p>Aquatic plants donít need to worry about drying out - they are bathed in water at all times. &nbsp;But plants on land do not enjoy the constant presence of water - they have developed characteristics that allow them to live without water's constant presence.</p><p><br>Aquatic plants also donít need structural tissue to provide support - the water provides structural support. &nbsp;On land - plants need specialized tissue to provide structural support.</p><p>Slide 2</p><p>One adaptation that terrestrial plants have to life on land is a waxy cuticle.&nbsp;</p><p>Waxes are lipids and thus are hydrophobic. &nbsp;A waxy cuticle is a layer on the surface of the leaves and stems that keeps water inside the body of the plant. &nbsp;This helps prevent drying out of the plant but the cuticle also prevents the movement of carbon dioxide and oxygen into and out of the plant. &nbsp;</p><p>Carbon dioxide needs to enter the leaves for photosynthesis to take place and the oxygen by-product needs to get out of the leaves.</p><p><br>Slide 3</p><p>The stomata help solve this problem. &nbsp;Stomata are pores on the surface of plant leaves that allow the exchange of carbon dioxide and oxygen.</p><p>The stomata are capable of opening and closing in response to the needs of the plants. &nbsp;When the stomata are open - like this one here - carbon dioxide and water can move in and out. &nbsp;</p><p>When the stomata are closed - like this one here - gases cannot move through. &nbsp;So, why would a plant close its stomata? &nbsp;Because water vapor can also move through the stomata. &nbsp;This means that if a plant keeps it stomata open - it risks drying out. &nbsp;So the stomata open and close in an attempt to maximize gas exchange while at the same time minimizing water loss.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Slide 4</p><p>Vascular tissue is another adaptation to the challenges of life on land. &nbsp;Vascular tissue is tissue that moves water and nutrients through the body of the plant. &nbsp;Water needs to move from the roots up to the leaves and sugars that are produced by photosynthesis need to move from the leaves to other parts of the plant.</p><p>The evolution of vascular tissue allowed for an increase in plant size. &nbsp;The nonvascular plants like the mosses lack this tissue and they do not get very large.</p><p>The vascular plants, on the other hand, can get very large, &nbsp;Think of the giant redwood trees of Northern California - their immense size is due to the presence of vascular tissue.</p><p>The vascular tissue prevents desiccation because it moves water around the plant and it can also become rigid and provide structural support.</p><p>Slide 5</p><p>The most sensitive stage of the life cycle for any organism is the embryonic stage. &nbsp;The gametes are also sensitive cells. &nbsp;Both embryos and gametes cannot survive desiccation so to be succesful on land - the land plants protect both gametes and embryos in jacketed tissues known as gametangia.</p><p>This tissue protects the gametes, zygote, and embryo be encasing them in a resistant cell layer.</p><p><br>Slide 6<br>&nbsp;<br>Pollen is another adaptation to the terrestrial environment. &nbsp;Not all plants produce pollen but the two groups that do - the gymnosperms and the angiosperms - are able to live in far drier environments than plants that do not make pollen - the mosses and ferns.</p><p>Pollen is a resistant structure that houses the male gametophyte - the structure that makes the sperm. &nbsp;</p><p>The pollen not only prevents dessication of the male gametes but it allows for greater plant dispersal because pollen-producing plants can use animals - like this honeybee - to transport pollen grains greater distances than an unprotected sperm can swim. We will talk about this idea in more detail when we discuss the pollen-producing plants.</p><p>Slide 7</p><p>Just like pollen - seeds are only found in two groups of plants - the same two that make pollen - the gymnosperms and the angiosperms.</p><p>Seeds are resistant structures that house the plant embryo. &nbsp;The seed not only protects the embryo from drying out but it also provides the embryo with a supply of nutrients - the seed contains an embryo and its food supply.</p><p>The seed also allows greater dispersal of plants - seeds can be carried by wind, water, or animals and thus spread individuals into new areas.</p><p>Both pollen and seeds are found in plants that tolerate dry environments and are able to disperse offspring far from the parent plant.</p><p>Slide 8</p><p>Flowers and fruit are the most recent evolutionary advances of the land plants. &nbsp;These features are found only in one group of plants - the angiosperms.</p><p>Flowers increase fertilization by attracting animal pollinators - animals carry pollen from one plant to another. &nbsp;Because the movement of animals is purposeful (as opposed to say the wind blowing or water flowing) - pollen can be moved efficiently from one plant to another and fertilization is improved. &nbsp;The Mountain Laurel is the Pennsylvania state flower and a nice example of a flowering plant.</p><p><br>Fruits develop from flowers and house the seeds. &nbsp;Fruits aid in seed dispersal often by using animals to spread seeds. &nbsp;This cedar waxwing is eating the fruits of the Mountain ash tree - the fruit will travel through his digestive system and he will deposit the seeds in a location away from the parent plant. &nbsp;</p><p>The presence of flowers and fruits has allowed the angiosperms to become the most succesful group of plants on earth.<br>&nbsp;</p>
