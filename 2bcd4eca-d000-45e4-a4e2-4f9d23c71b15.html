<p>[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=2851|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__left__lightboxed]Our discussion of fungal diversity continues with the phylum Ascomycota. With over 60,000 described species, it is the largest, most biologically and morphologically diverse group in the kingdom. It contains&nbsp;some of the most destructive human and plant pathogens, including many that form various mutualistic symbioses, and varies morphologically from unicellular&nbsp;<strong>yeasts</strong>&nbsp;to complex cup fungi. Almost half of all members of the phylum Ascomycota form symbiotic associations with algae and basidiomycetes&nbsp;to form lichens. Others, such as morels (a highly prized edible fungus), form important mychorrhizal relationships with plants, thereby providing enhanced water and nutrient uptake and, in some cases, protection from insects. In a typical forest&nbsp;<strong>ascomycetes</strong>&nbsp;can appear as&nbsp;a conspicuous mushroom or as&nbsp;disease symptoms on the surface of plant leaves. This group also contains the single-celled yeasts. These members of the Ascomycota have been exploited by humans for centuries for the production of fermented foods and beverages, such as bread and wine.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Basic Morphology</h2>
<p>[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=2853|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__right__lightboxed]The defining morphological character of the phylum Ascomycota is the production of four to eight sexual spores in a microscopic sac-like cell called an&nbsp;<strong>ascus</strong>. Hence, they are sometimes referred to as "<strong>sac fungi</strong>." In addition, most ascomycetes bear their asci in macroscopic fruiting bodies called ascocarps. Ascomycetes are also capable of producing enormous amounts of asexual spores called conidia, which allow them to propagate without having to undergo sexual recombination. This feature can be particularly destructive because these plant pathogenic fungi can cause devastating epidemics via repeated rounds of asexual reproduction with the dissemination of billions of conidia in a short period of time. Conidia are usually produced externally on the tips of modified hyphae in simple chains or clusters. Prior to sexual reproduction, compatible haploid mating-type hyphae (+ and -) fuse to form a dikaryotic hypha. In contrast to the basidiomycetes, ascomycetes have a more limited dikaryotic stage. The dikaryotic stage eventually gives rise to an ascocarp and sexual&nbsp;<strong>ascospores</strong>.</p>
<p>Because of the unique reproductive structure of the Ascomycota (the ascus), several species&nbsp;are common model organisms. &nbsp;A&nbsp;<b>model organism</b>&nbsp;is a non-human organism that is studied to understand particular aspects of biology. &nbsp;Model organisms are usually chosen because they are readily accessible, inexpensive, reproduce quickly,&nbsp;and are easy to keep alive in a laboratory. &nbsp;Studying these organisms is expected to&nbsp;provide insight into the workings of other organisms - particularly humans. &nbsp;In the BIOL 110 lab you will be working with the ascomycete fungus <em>Sordaria </em>to try to understand how it responds to environmental stress. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Phylum Ascomycota: Life Cycle</h2>
<p>Let's turn our attention to the life cycle of the typical ascomycete. Start with step 1 in the sexual part of the life cycle, in which two compatible haploid hyphae become intertwined and form an ascogonium and an antheridium. In this case, in step 2, the ascogonium acts as a "female" and accepts nuclei from the antheridium after plasmogamy has occurred. In step 3, the resultant dikaryon is then capable of forming a cup-shaped ascocarp. In step 4, asci begin to form on the surface of the ascocarp at the tips of the dikaryotic mycelium, and in step 5, karyogamy occurs to form the highly transient diploid nucleus. In step 6, the diploid nucleus immediately undergoes meiosis, yielding four, genetically distinct, haploid nuclei. In step 7, after an additional round of mitosis, the ascus now contains eight haploid nuclei. In step 8, these eight nuclei will eventually develop into eight ascospores, which are released from the ascus on the surface of the ascocarp. In the final step in the sexual cycle (step 9), haploid mycelia arise from the aforementioned ascospores as the sexual cycle begins again.</p>

<p>Next, turn your attention to the left side of the diagram. Step 10 depicts the asexual part of the life cycle. Here, a compatible haploid partner is not present and the haploid mycelium is capable of producing asexual spores (conidia) by segmentation of its hyphae. These segments will compartmentalize into conidia, and wind or water dispersal will follow.</p>
