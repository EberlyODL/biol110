<p>Watson and Crick concluded their 1953 paper on the structure of DNA with the following statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>"It has not escaped our notice that the specific pairing we have postulated immediately suggests a possible copying mechanism for the genetic material."</p></blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;The "specific pairing" they mentioned is the hydrogen-bonds between adenine and thymine, and guanine and cytosine. The "copying mechanism" is DNA replication, a simple yet accurate series of steps by which DNA carries the instructions for its own reproduction.</p>
<p>This tutorial will cover the process of DNA replication.&nbsp; Remember, every time a cell divides - it must replicate its DNA. By the end of the tutorial you should have a basic understanding of:</p>
<ul><li>When DNA replication takes place</li><li>Where DNA replication takes place</li><li>How DNA replication takes place</li><li>What happens if there is a mistake during DNA replication</li><li>Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)</li></ul>
<p>Performance Objectives:</p>
<ul><li>Compare and contrast the structures of DNA and RNA</li><li>Diagram the process of DNA replication, including all of the enzymes and molecules that are necessary</li><li>Describe the antiparallel structure of a DNA molecule and the implications this has for DNA replication</li><li>Explain the different DNA repair mechanisms and the different possible types of mutations</li><li>Explain how PCR is used to amplify a gene</li></ul>
