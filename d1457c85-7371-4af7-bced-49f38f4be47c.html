<p>The protists are comprised of diverse organisms that are polyphyletic in origin. Earlier taxonomic schemes that grouped all of these organisms into a single kingdom were not very informative because they were not based on the evolutionary relationships between different protistan groups. The revised classification scheme presented here is considered superior because it does take into account these evolutionary relationships.</p>
<p>As you learned, not all eukaryotes have mitochondria. Keep in mind that their lifestyle (as microsymbionts) does not require these organelles because they are quite successful living in the way that they do (although, sometimes at the expense of their hosts).</p>
<p>Members of the kingdom Euglenozoa do have mitochondria, but are a diverse group in terms of structure. All euglenoids have a flagellum, whereas the kinetoplastids have a kinetoplast. The euglenoids are typically free-living (and can be photoautotrophic), whereas the kinetoplastids are all microsymbionts (some, like the trypanosomes, are pathogenic).</p>
<p>Members of Kingdom Alveolata are even more diverse. They include the dinoflagellates that are involved in such diverse activities as coral reef building and that cause various forms of red tide. They play a major role in the ecology of ocean communities because they comprise a significant portion of the phytoplankton that&nbsp;forms the basis of many aquatic food webs.</p>
<p>The apicomplexans all form parasitic symbioses, therefore, they have a major impact on other life. The causative agent of malaria is caused by&nbsp;<em>Plasmodium</em>. More people are killed each year by malaria than by any other transmissible disease (besides tuberculosis). Keep in mind the importance of understanding a pathogen's life cycle when public health decisions need to be made.</p>
