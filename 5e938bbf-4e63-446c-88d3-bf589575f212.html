<p>Fungi exhibit several different types of life cycles. This generalized diagram&nbsp;depicts the typical sequence of events in the life cycles of fungi. Focus on the "mycelium (n)" box for a starting point for both the sexual and asexual life cycles. Note, many species can produce asexual <strong>spores</strong> by mitosis in specialized spore-producing structures. This allows the organism to clone itself while, often times, producing very large numbers of asexual spores. The hyphae of many species are haploid during the majority of their life cycles. Many fungi spend a good portion of their life in the asexual mode. The transition to the sexual mode can be triggered by certain conditions (e.g., light, temperature, moisture, availability of a sexually compatible partner, and limited nutrient availability).</p>

<p>The sexual stage is characterized by several features that are unique to the kingdom Fungi. Most fungal mating types are morphologically indistinguishable and so, they are not referred to as male or female (fungi also do not produce gametes, sperm or eggs). Rather, they are simply referred to as "+" or "-" to let one know they are different mating types (sexually compatible). In the case of sexual reproduction, compatible mating types fuse in a process that involves&nbsp;<strong>plasmogamy</strong>&nbsp;(fusion of cell membranes). This fusion produces a&nbsp;<strong>heterokaryon</strong>&nbsp;(a mycelium with multiple nuclei from the two mating types) or&nbsp;<strong>dikaryon</strong>&nbsp;(a mycelium with two nuclei from the two mating types; these are found in Ascomycetes and Basidiomycetes), which can divide in the growing mycelium for a prolonged period; we will use the term dikaryon in this discussion of the life cycle. The prolonged dikaryotic stage is a feature unique to fungi. It is thought that the dikaryotic state provides the organism with genetic flexibility in a competitive environment while, at the same time, conferring it with many of the same advantages as a diploid because it possesses a complementary set of chromosomes. The dikaryotic state can last for months, or even years, while the fungus continues to grow and proliferate in its environment.When environmental conditions are suitable, two haploid nuclei fuse (<strong>karyogamy</strong>) to form a highly transient diploid state. Meiosis follows, almost immediately, in a specialized spore-producing structure, and genetically distinct haploid spores are produced.<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="450" src="https://voicethread.com/app/player/?threadId=4662030" width="800"></iframe></p>
