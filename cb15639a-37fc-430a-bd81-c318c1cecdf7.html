<h2>Population Genetics Part 1 VoiceThread Transcript</h2><p>Slide 1<br>So far, we have dealt with the behavior of genes between generations and focused on the phenotypes of individuals. Next we'll take a broader look at genetics and see how the genetics of populations are studied.</p><p>Population genetics is the field of biology that studies the genetic composition of populations, and the changes in genetic composition that result from the operation of various evolutionary factors</p><p><br>Slide 2<br>Population geneticists study populations. &nbsp;Populations are groups of individuals of the same species that live in the same geographic area or range.</p><p>When population geneticists study a population - they study the gene pool of the population. &nbsp;The gene pool is the sum of the alleles present in a population at a particular time. &nbsp;</p><p>Populations can vary in the amount of genetic variation (and thus alleles) that is found in the population. &nbsp;For example, at the Penn State - University Park campus - the population of gray squirrels is monomorphic for fur color and are all gray while the squirrels on the Kent State campus are polymorphic - there are gray and black squirrels. &nbsp;This means there is more genetic variation in the Kent State population with respect to coat color.</p><p><br>Slide 3<br>Population geneticists have a tool that allows them to keep track of allele and genotype frequencies in a population (it is similar to the Punneqq square tool the geneticists use to analyze crosses between individuals).</p><p>This tool is known as the Hardy-Weinberg equation and it has two components. &nbsp;The first is the equation that sums allele frequencies (we will start by looking at a gene with two alleles).</p><p>In a gene with two alleles - we will indicate one allele as p (this is typically the dominant allele) and the other allele as q (this is typically the recessive allele). &nbsp;For a gene with just these two alleles - the frequency of these alleles must sum to 1. &nbsp;So p + q = 1.</p><p>For a gene with two alleles there are three possible genotypes - homozygous dominant, heterozygous, and homozygous recessive. &nbsp;The frequency of the homozygous dominant individuals is p^2, the frequency of the heterozygous individuals is 2pq, and the frequency of the homozygous recessive individuals is q^2. &nbsp;These indivdiual<br>frequencies must sum to 1.</p><p><br>Slide 4<br>We can look at an example using a hypothetical gene A in which the frequency of the dominant allele is .2 and the frequency of the recessive allele is .8. &nbsp;We can also visualize the Hardy-Weinberg equation by using a Punnett Square - in this example we are using a Punnett square to visualize a potential cross between all individuals in the population so we must include the allele frequencies along with the alleles along the axes.</p><p>When we fill out the Punnett square we see the frequency of homozygous dominant individuals is .04, the frequency of heterozygotes is .32 (using the 2pq part of the equation). &nbsp;The frequency of homozygous recessive individuals is .64. &nbsp;The sum of .04 and .32 and .64 is 1.</p><p>In the absence of outside factors, the frequencies of gametes, genotypes, and phenotypes stay the same from one generation to the next.</p><p>Population geneticists use this tool to watch for changes in allele and genotype frequencies.</p><p>Slide 5<br>As you have learned earlier, some genes have more than two alleles. &nbsp;So we can take a more complicated look at population genetics and the Hardy-Weinberg equation by looking at an example of a gene with three alleles.</p><p>Typically, in a three allele situation, we use the letters p, q, and r to describe the three alleles. &nbsp;The genotype frequencies are derived from multiplying (p+q+r) times (p+q+r). &nbsp;This gives genotype frequencies of p^2 + 2pq + q^2 + r^2 + 2pr + 2qr.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Slide 6<br>Remember that our definition of evolution is a change in the genetic structure of a population. &nbsp;This means a change in allele and genotype frequencies. &nbsp;The Hardy-Weinberg equation is a tool that allows us to monitor changes in allele and genotype frequencies and thus observe evolution occuring in populations.</p><p>When allele and genotype frequencies change in populations - we refer to the population as moving out of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. &nbsp;It is the forces of evolution - such as natural selection - that move a population out of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.</p>
