<p>To understand the evolutionary history of animals, scientists rely on several types of data including, but not limited to, the following: the overall morphology of the organism, DNA sequence comparisons, other similarities at the molecular level, and the developmental sequence of events in the embryo.</p>

<p>The sequence of events during embryonic development is the main characteristic used to distinguish protostomes and deuterostomes. Review the figure at right, which shows the major developmental characters that distinguish a protostome from a deuterostome. Recall that, in general, in protostomes the mouth forms first, whereas in deuterostomes it forms secondarily (the two names are based upon this difference). Another important distinction is how the coelom forms; in protostomes it forms from a splitting of the mesoderm, whereas in most deuterostomes the coelom forms from mesodermal outpocketings of the archenteron.</p>
<p>In this tutorial we will focus on the two major deuterostome phyla, Echinodermata and Chordata.</p>
