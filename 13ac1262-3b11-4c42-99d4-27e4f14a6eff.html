<h2>Gene to Protein Part 2 VoiceThread Transcript</h2><p>Slide 1<br>The second stage of protein synthesis is translation. &nbsp;This is the stage where the genetic information in the messenger RNA molecule is used to produce a polypeptide.</p><p>This process takes place in the cytoplasm at structures known as ribosomes. &nbsp;Ribosomes help to build the protein.</p><p>Translation requires raw materials. &nbsp;The process requires the molecule of messener RNA to provide the instructions for building the protein.</p><p>It requires a molecule of tRNA or transfer RNA to carry the amino acids to the ribosome.</p><p>And translation requires a supply of amino acids - the building blocks of proteins.</p><p>Slide 2<br>The process of translation requires a language change - that is why this stage of protein synthesis is known as translation. &nbsp;The cell is using information in the language of DNA and RNA to create a protein. &nbsp;DNA and RNA are nucleic acids whose language is built on the five nucleotides - A, G, C, T, and U. &nbsp;Proteins are in the language of the twenty different amino acids.</p><p>The genetic code serves as the translator between these two languages.</p><p>The genetic code is a triplet code - it uses a sequence of three nucleotides (known as a codon) to code for an amino acid.</p><p>The Genetic Code is redundant - more than one codon specifies the same amino acid.</p><p>The Genetic code is unambiguous - each codon species only one AA</p><p>It is also universal - virtually the same across all organisms</p><p>It has specific signals to specify the start and stop of a polypeptide.</p><p><br>Slide 3<br>This is the genetic code from the tutorial and it is the version we will use for the course. &nbsp;Let's look at some of the features of the genetic code.</p><p>To start - the genetic code is written in the language of mRNA. And this version of the code orients you to the polarity of the mRNA molecule - the first base is the 5' end of the mRNA molecule and the third base is the 3' end.&nbsp;</p><p>It is a triplet code. &nbsp;For example, the mRNA codon UUU codes for the amino acid phenylalanine. &nbsp;And it is unambigous - UUU codes for phenylalanine and only phenylalanine. &nbsp;But there is also redundancy - because the codon UUC also codes for phenylalanine.</p><p>There is one start codon - this is the codon AUG - which There is one start codon - ANUG - and it codes for the amino acid methionine. &nbsp;This means that all proteins start with the amino acid methionine (the mature protein may have the methionine removed but at least initially all proteins start with methionine). &nbsp;</p><p>There are 3 stop codons - UAA, UAG, and UGA. &nbsp;They do not code for an amino acid and instead signal the end of a protein.</p><p><br>Slide 4<br>The molecule that is responsible for translating between the language of RNA and the language of protein is transfer RNA - also known as tRNA. &nbsp;We can focus on the simplified view of the tRNA molecule.</p><p>There are two regions of the molecule that are important - the anticodon region and the amino acid attachment site. &nbsp;The anticodon region is a sequenc of 3 RNA nucleotides that are complimentary to a codon in the mRNA. &nbsp;The anticodon determines the amino acid that will attach to the amino acid attachment site.</p><p><br>Slide 5<br>For example, the mRNA codon 5' CCU 3' - codes for the amino acid Proline. &nbsp;The tRNA molecule that will carry the amino acid proline will have the anticodon of 3' GGA 5' (remember, nucleic acid pairings have to follow the base pairing rules as well as the polarity rules). &nbsp;The tRNA with an anticodon sequence of 3'GGA 5' will carry the amino acid proline at its amino acid attachment site.</p><p><br>Slide 6<br>In this way, tRNA is the molecular translator that translates the genetic information in a messenger RNA molecule into the language of protein.&nbsp;</p><p>The process occurs at the ribosome. &nbsp;In this image, we see a ribosome in blue - it is made up of two subunits - the small ribosomal subunit and the large ribosomal subunit. &nbsp;These two subunits come together and sandwhich the mRNA molecule. &nbsp;While the mRNA molecule is held between the two subunits - the tRNA molecules carry the appropriate amino acids to the ribosome to create the protein.</p><p>The codons in the mRNA provide the instructions and the tRNA essentially follows the instructions and adds the correct amino acid to the growing protein until a stop codon is reached. &nbsp;Once the stop codon is reached - the ribosome separates and the protein has been made.</p><p><br>Slide 7<br>The following slides are practice problems using the genetic code. &nbsp;When you have answered these questions - access the next Voice Thread to see the solutions.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p>
