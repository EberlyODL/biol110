<p>The available astronomical data indicate that the universe is about 13.7 billion years old. This estimate is based, in part, on the observation that the universe is constantly expanding. Astronomers have plotted the trajectories (directional movement) of various stars and galaxies and determined that all matter in the known universe arose from a common point. In an event often referred to as the "Big Bang," the universe arose in a relatively brief moment in time and matter was flung outward from this central origin. Since this beginning, this vast amount of matter has been hurling through space, undergoing a number of many changes as it traverses the cosmos. By using radiometric dating techniques (discussed later in this tutorial) of pristine meteorites, astronomers have determined that our own solar system formed 4.55 - 4.56 billion years ago. The <a href="http://hubblesite.org/gallery/" rel="nofollow">Hubble telescope</a> was dispatched in 1990 to explore the far reaches of our galaxy and to photograph astronomical events such as star formation. Astronomers use images captured by the Hubble telescope to further our understanding of the origin of the universe and solar systems.

<h2>The Conditions on Early Earth
</h2>
<p>The atmosphere on early Earth was strikingly different from that of today. Primitive Earth's atmosphere consisted of methane, ammonia, hydrogen, water vapor, and a negligible amount of free oxygen. This is an important point because if there was a lot of free oxygen available, life probably could not have arisen from inorganic compounds. This is because oxygen tends to <strong>oxidize</strong>&nbsp;substances, which means that electrons are removed. Importantly, the early atmosphere was highly <strong>reducing</strong> (capable of gaining electrons and forming more complex molecules).

<h2>Evidence for the Chemical Evolution of Life
</h2>
<p>Charles Darwin wrote of "some warm little pond" in which life could have begun. While this idea was initially scorned, in reality, he might not have been too far from the truth. About forty years later the Scotsman, John Haldane, and the Russian, Alexander Oparin, independently developed a model that has been called the primordial soup model for the origin of life. Basically this model suggests that complex, metabolically active molecules could arise from a slurry of simple chemicals occurring in the right proportions. This idea was tested in 1953 by Stanley Miller and Harold Urey in their classic but quite simple experiment. In the Miller-Urey experiment, a mixture of gases (methane, ammonia, hydrogen, and water vapor) representing the primitive atmosphere was subjected to an electrical discharge. This figure shows their experimental set up. The compounds formed were then condensed and sampled. The solution was found to contain a variety of organic compounds, including aldehydes, carboxylic acid, and amino acids. Thereby, Miller and Urey affirmed that organic compounds could arise in abiotic conditions similar to those that existed on early Earth.

</p>
<p>The Miller-Urey experiment has often been repeated, and similar set-ups have generated various organic compounds (including ATP when phosphate is added to the initial slurry). However, there are still various aspects about abiotic synthesis of organic compounds that stimulate much debate. For instance, many scientists feel that the essential ingredients for these early chemical reactions could have come from deep-sea vents in Earth's oceans or from submerged volcanoes, rather than from the early atmosphere. Also, the first cells might have been <strong>autotrophs</strong>, using inorganic sulfur and iron compounds to gain energy, rather than consuming organic molecules (<strong>heterotrophs</strong>). Ultimately, these laboratory simulations give us insight into how the chemicals necessary for life could have formed.

<h2>Early Earth
</h2>
<p>Our own limited lifespan could lead us to believe that Earth is a stable structure, however, geological data indicate that Earth has changed radically since its origin 4.5 billion years ago. In fact, Earth's surface is dynamic. Earth's crust consists of large plates that move with respect to each other. This movement, termed <strong>plate tectonics</strong>, is due to activity at spreading centers and subduction zones. As a result of this crust movement, the continents are constantly rearranging themselves in a phenomenon known as <strong>continental drift</strong>. When two plates intersect, any number of geological events (e.g., mountain building, volcanic eruptions, and earthquakes) can result. Continental drift can be measured by a variety of techniques, and geologists have discovered that different land masses drift at different rates. The slowest rates of movement are about 2.5 cm/year, whereas the fastest are around 15 cm/year. Given the vast amount of water on the planet, this redistribution of land also influences ocean partitioning and water levels. (changes in climate also influence water distributions.) In the last 4 billion years, many changes in landmasses have occurred on the planet. About 250 million years ago, all of the landmasses were joined as a supercontinent that geologists named <strong>Pangaea</strong>. About 180 million years ago, Pangaea began to break apart into the Northern Laurasia and Southern Gondwana landmasses, which eventually separated to create the landmasses that exist today. The history of a supercontinent explains many of the similarities observed in modern organisms on separate landmasses.
