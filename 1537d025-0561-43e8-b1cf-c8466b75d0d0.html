<p>The last tutorial explored the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis. These reactions begin with the absorption of light energy by pigments, and end with the production of stored chemical energy in the form of NADPH and ATP. Now we will follow the NADPH and ATP molecules as they enter the&nbsp;<strong>Calvin cycle</strong>. Their stored energy will be used to make sugar from carbon dioxide. These anabolic reactions are endergonic (+Î”G), and therefore require energy (from ATP and NADPH). The basic relationship between the Calvin cycle and the light-dependent reactions is summarized in the figure below.</p>

<p>These reactions are sometimes called the "dark reactions" because they can occur in the dark (as long as ATP and NADPH are available). All of the processes of photosynthesis (both light-dependent and light-independent reactions) occur within the chloroplast. By the end of this tutorial you should have a basic working understanding of:</p>
<ul><li>The energetics of photosynthesis</li><li>The basic workings of the Calvin cycle (including the fixation, reduction, and regeneration phases)</li></ul>
<p>Performance objectives:</p>
<ul><li>Illustrate the importance of redox reactions in photosynthesis</li><li>Review that relationship between the light dependent and light independent reactions</li><li>Describe the inputs and outputs for the light independent reactions</li></ul>
