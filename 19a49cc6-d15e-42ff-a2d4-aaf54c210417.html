<h2>Population Genetics Part 3 VoiceThread Transcript</h2><p>Slide 1<br>Ok - let's work through the solutions to these problems.</p><p>In this question, you are given the frequency of the dominant allele (p = .3) and the frequency of the recessive allele (q = .7).</p><p>You are asked to determine the frequency of carriers in this population. &nbsp;</p><p>Slide 2<br>Remember, carriers are heterozygotes and to determine the frequency of heterozygotes you always need to multiply by 2. &nbsp;Thus we see that in this population, the frequency of carriers is .42 or 42%.</p><p>Slide 3<br>This question asks you to determine an allele frequency when you are given a genotype frequency. &nbsp;When you are presented with a Hardy-Weinberg question - I suggest you take the time to figure out what information you have been given. &nbsp;In this question you are told that 81% of the people in Smallville USA have a smooth chin. &nbsp;Having a smooth chin is an expression of a person's genotype - and having a smooth chin is the recessive condition. &nbsp;That means that q^2 =81% or .81.</p><p><br>Slide 4<br>Remember, q^2 is the frequency of homozygous recessive individuals in the population and anyone with a smooth chin is homozygous recessive.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Slide 5<br>If q^2 equals .81, we can then solve for q by taking the square root of .81 - which equals .9. &nbsp;If q = .9, then p=.1 or 10% (p is the frequency of the dominant cleft chin allele.</p><p>So the answer is A - 10%.</p><p><br>Slide 6<br>Now we will do some sample problems looking at a gene with three alleles - and we will use the ABO blood group as our example. &nbsp;The ABO blood group gene has three alleles - the A allele, the B allele, and the O allele. &nbsp;Given these three alleles - what are the possible genotypes?</p><p><br>Slide 7<br>There are 6 different possible genotypes - remember that in this gene the A and B allele are both dominant to the O allele and A and B are codominant to each other. &nbsp;So while there are 6 different genotypes there are only four different phenotypes - type A blood, type B blood, type AB blood and type O blood.</p><p><br>Slide 8<br>To apply this blood group gene to the Hardy-Weinberg equation we can standardize the notations so that p, q, and r &nbsp;are the A allele, B allele, and O allele respectively.</p><p>The genotype frequencies are p^2 + 2pq + q^2 + r^2 + 2pr + 2qr and they correlate to the blood group genotypes: IAIA + IAIB + IBIB + ii + IAi + IBi.</p><p><br>Slide 9<br>This question asks you to apply your understanding of the ABO blood group to the Hardy-Weinberg variables.</p><p>Slide 10<br>The answer is E - Both A and B. &nbsp;This is because p^2 refers to the homozygous A genotype and 2pr refers to the heterozygous A and O genotype. &nbsp;Both genotypes result in Type A blood.</p><p><br>Slide 11<br>So now we are ready to answer a question about the frequency of the B allele in a population. &nbsp;We are told that in this population, the frequency of the A allele is .3 and the frequency of people with Type O blood is 36.</p><p><br>Slide 12<br>Again, it is helpful to take the time to write out what is known about the population. &nbsp;We know that the A allele is .3 - this is p. &nbsp;We also know that the frequency of people with type O blood is .36 - this is the homozygous recessive genotype or r^2. &nbsp;</p><p>From r^2 we can solve for r which equals .6.</p><p>Given these numbers, we can now determine that the frequency of the B allele is .1.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Slide 13<br>Now you are asked to determine the frequency of people with Type B blood.</p><p><br>Slide 14<br>You can use the calculations you did for the previous question and recognize that there are two ways to have Type B blood - either genotype homozygous B which corresponds to q^2 or heterozygous for B and O which corresponds to 2qr. &nbsp;In this population, 13% of the people are expected to have Type B blood.</p>
