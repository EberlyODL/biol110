<h2>Chromosome Behavior and Sex Chromosomes Part 1 VoiceThread Transcript</h2>
<p>Slide 1<br>Do traits on sex chromosomes behave differently?&nbsp; Why or why not?</p>
<p>Slide 2<br>Yes and no - yes because males and females have different sex chromosomes (males=XY, females=XX).&nbsp; No because sex chromosomes go through meiosis just like autosomes. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Slide 3<br>Humans (and most mammals) as well as fruit flies have an X-Y system of sex determination - females have two copies of the X chromosome and males have an X and a Y.</p>
<p>During meiosis, the X and Y chromosome behave somewhat like a homologous pair - in males the X and Y segregate from each other just like homolgous pairs do - the result is that males produce two kinds of gametes - gametes with an X chromosome or gametes with a Y chromosome.</p>
<p>Females can only make gametes with an X chromosome.</p>
<p>Slide 4<br>Sex-linked genes are genes that are found on the sex-chromosomes.&nbsp; Because males and females have a different complement of sex chromosomes we expect sex-linked genes to show a different pattern of inheritance in males and females.</p>
<p>For the purposes of this course, we will limit our discussion of sex-linked genes to genes found on this X chromosome.&nbsp; This is because the Y chromosome is significantly smaller than the X chromosome and does not contain many genes (although the Y chromosome does contain the genes that make a male a male). &nbsp;</p>
<p>Even though the X and Y behave like homologs during meiosis - there is in reality very little homology between them - in other words, they do not have the same genes.</p>
<p>This means that typically males only have one copy of each gene found on the X chromosome.&nbsp; We use the term "hemizygous" to describe this condition.&nbsp; A male cannot be homozygous or heterozygous for X-linked genes - because he only has one copy of the X chromosome.</p>
<p>Slide 5<br>The X-Y system of sex-determination is only one way sex is determined in organisms.&nbsp; Some insects, for example cockroaches, use a system known as X-O - females have two X chromosomes just as in humans but males just have a single X chromosome.</p>
<p>Birds have a system known as Z-W - there are two different sex chromosomes but in birds it is the female that has two different sex chromosomes and the male has two that are the same.</p>
<p>Some insects, known as the eusocial insects because of their highly social behavior and include species of ants and bees, have a sex-determination system known as haplo-diploidy.&nbsp; In these insects there are no distinct sex chromosomes - instead the males are haploid and the females are diploid.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Slide 6<br>The specific examples of sex-linked inheritance that we will look at will only involve organisms with an XY system of sex determination such as humans and fruit flies.</p>
<p>There are some important consequences of gemes being found on the X chromosome that are not found on the Y chromosome.</p>
<p>For example, only females can be carriers for sex-linked recessive traits - remember that carriers are heterozygous and males cannot be heterozygous for X-linked traits (and are termed hemizygous).</p>
<p>Therefore, males will always express an X-linked trait - whether it is dominant or recessive.&nbsp; This is in contrast to females - for a female to express a sex-linked recessive trait she must have two copies of the recessive allele.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Slide 7<br>Here are some examples of Punnett squares that examine sex-linked crosses.&nbsp; Notice that when creating a Punnett square for an x-linked trait you must include both the X and Y chromosome for the male so you can keep track of inheritance differences between males and females.</p>
<p>In scenario 1, a homozygous dominant female is crossed with an affected male (this trait is x-linked recessive).&nbsp; The result is that all female offspring will be carriers for the trait and all males will be unaffected.</p>
<p>In scenario 2, the female is a carrier and the male is unaffected.&nbsp; In the resulting offspring, the females are either homozygous dominant or carriers.&nbsp; The males are either unaffected or affected.</p>
<p>In scenario 3, the female is a carrier and the male is affected.&nbsp; This is the only scenario in which it is possible to see affected female offspring. &nbsp;</p>
<p>X-linked recessive traits are expressed more commonly in males than in females.&nbsp;</p>
