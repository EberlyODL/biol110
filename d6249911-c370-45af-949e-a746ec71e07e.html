<p>Remember that our own bodies are teeming with bacteria, as are virtually all eukaryotes. At birth we were devoid of bacteria, but as we acquired bacteria through feeding, and simply by being around other humans and the environment, our bodies became colonized with hundreds of different species of bacteria. The relative proportions of these species are variable. However, some of our commensalistic bacteria can become parasitic when our natural defense mechanisms become depressed.</p><p>[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=2374|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__right__lightboxed]</p><p>In Summer 2012, research groups published major findings from the Human Microbiome Project; the genetic material of bacteria taken from 242 healthy people was sequenced by a team of 200 scientists from 80 different institutions.&nbsp; They found that each person had about 1000 different strains of bacteria living on or in their bodies (two to five pounds!), and that this “<strong>microbiome</strong>” was different for each person. All individuals had some disease-causing bacteria in their microbiome, but it was not causing disease. They also discovered that babies born via a C-section had different microbiomes than babies born vaginally. As a scientist, what would you do to follow up on this finding?</p><p>The relationship between host and symbiont can be quite complex. Termites are a good example of this complexity. We normally think of these insects as wood eaters, and indeed they can dine on our homes. However, they themselves cannot directly digest the wood. Inside the termite gut is a menagerie of protists (to be discussed in future tutorials) that ingest the wood particles consumed by the termite. But even these protists cannot directly digest the cellulose. Rather, living in and around the protozoa are bacteria that can degrade the wood. So it is the microsymbiont living within the microsymbiont of the termite host that actually degrades the wood. Life is interrelated in surprising ways.</p>
