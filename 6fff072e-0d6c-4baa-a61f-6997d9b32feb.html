<p>During the early 1700â€™s, a small group of pacifist Protestants fled Germany to avoid religious persecution. This group, the Dunkers, settled in the farmland of eastern Pennsylvania and has been relatively isolated from other groups of people living in the area (they have strict rules about marriage outside of the group). The original group was comprised of 50 families.</p>
<p>The current Dunker population is genetically distinct from the rest of the United States (and modern Germany) in terms of the ABO blood group system. In the Dunker population, the frequency of the&nbsp;<em>I<sup>A</sup></em>&nbsp;allele is .30 (30%) and the frequency of the O blood type is .16 (16%). In the general US and German population the frequency of the&nbsp;<em>I<sup>A</sup></em>allele is .40 and the frequency of the O blood type is .25 (25%).</p>
<ul><li>What are the frequencies of the&nbsp;<em>I<sup>B</sup></em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>i</em>&nbsp;alleles in both populations?</li><li>Use your knowledge of the founder effect to explain the differences in ABO blood group allele frequencies between the 2 populations and indicate whether or not this is an example of adaptive evolution.</li></ul>
