<p>Coral bleaching is the loss of color of coral reefs due to the loss of zoothanthellae algae that live symbiotically within anthozoan corals. Bleaching is a worldwide problem and likely involves many factors. One area of study focuses on how the global warming of ocean waters is creating an unfavorable environment for anthozoan coral-builders and their symbionts. In a healthy coral community the zooxanthellae actively photosynthesize and produce more anabolic products than their own catabolic pathways consume; the excess anabolic products are then passed to the anthozoan coral builders which use the products for activities that include the calcification required to build a coral reef. It has been noted that when the temperature is elevated, Photosystem II can become damaged at high light levels. The causes of the process of bleaching are still under debate and it is not clear whether the zooxanthellae leave the anthozoan on their own, or whether the anthozoan actively rejects the symbiont.</p>
<ul><li>Describe the symbiotic relationship between the zooxanthellae and the anthozoa that live in waters in which they co-evolved and compare this to the symbiotic relationship that now exists in areas experiencing bleaching.</li><li>Based upon this information would you predict that coral bleaching increases the evolutionary fitness of the anthozoan host? Why or why not?</li></ul>
