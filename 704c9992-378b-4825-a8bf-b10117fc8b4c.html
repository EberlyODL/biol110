<h3>Introduction and Learning Objectives</h3>
<p>This tutorial will introduce the protists, which include many types of eukaryotic organisms and there is great diversity in this group (such as&nbsp;<em>Giardia lamblia</em>, seen in this image).&nbsp; The taxonomy of this group is currently under extensive revision, therefore, no two textbooks present the same taxonomic scheme. The emerging science of comparative genomics is revising the structure of the tree of life on a nearly daily basis.</p>

<p>This course uses a tree of life that has three domains (Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukarya). Recall, the non-mitochondrial/chloroplast DNA in a eukaryotic cell is located within the nucleus, which is surrounded by the nuclear envelope. Eukaryotic cells also possess extensive systems of intracellular membranes that provide elaborate internal compartmentalization. Additionally, eukaryotic cells usually have organelles that are specialized for different functions. In contrast, prokaryotic DNA is concentrated in the nucleoid region, which is analogous to the eukaryotic nucleus, but is not membrane-bound (discussed in the tutorial titled "Prokaryotes I - Cellular and Genetic Organization"). Prokaryotes do not have mitochondria or chloroplasts, and they generally have internal membrane systems that are far less complex than those found in the eukaryotes.</p>
<p>This tutorial contains a number of links that have been included for your interest. The material in these Web sites need not be memorized unless the material is covered directly in the text of the tutorial.</p>
<p>By the end of this tutorial you should have a working knowledge of the following:</p>
<ul><li>Different groups of protists including the protists with modified mitochondria and Kingdoms Euglenozoa and Alveolata</li><li>The role of protists in various mammalian diseases (e.g., giardiasis, trypanosomiasis, and malaria)</li><li>Dinoflagellates and their ecological roles in various habitats (e.g., coral reefs and red tides)</li></ul>
<p>Performance Objectives (for both tutorials covering the Protists):</p>
<ul><li>Describe the general characteristics of the protists</li><li>Summarize the basic classification of protists</li><li>Explain why Kingdom "Protista" is no longer recognized</li><li>Identify monophyletic, paraphyletic and polyphyletic groups</li><li>For each taxonomic group of protists, identify the major characteristic(s) of that group and be able to discuss representatives that demonstrate the diversity of the group</li><li>Explain different ways in which protists impact humans, either directly or indirectly</li></ul>
