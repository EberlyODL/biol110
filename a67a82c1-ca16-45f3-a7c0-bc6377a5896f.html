<p>Each tutorial will include an "<strong>Introduction and Learning Objectives</strong>" section . This section provides an overview of the tutorial. You might find it helpful to go back to this section after you complete the tutorial and see if you understand the major objectives. A good test for comprehension, upon completing the tutorial, is to pull out a piece of paper and draw out some of the main points of each objective. Remember, the more actively you use these tutorials, the more beneficial they will be to you.</p>
<p>Each tutorial also includes embedded mini-lectures.&nbsp; These mini-lectures are intended to reinforce the important concepts in the tutorial.&nbsp; Additionally, some of the mini-lectures include practice problems for you to work through and follow-up explanations for how to work through the problems.&nbsp; Please be sure to listen to these mini-lectures and work through the practice problems - you will be responsible for this information for the quizzes and exams.</p>
<p>At the end of the reading, there is a "<strong>Terms</strong>" list.&nbsp; You should have a working knowledge of these terms and understand how they are used in the tutorials. The terms appear in bold when they are first defined in the tutorial. If you form a study group (and we suggest you do this), then practice using these new words with your study partners. Some students find it helpful to use 3x5 cards with the word on the front and the definition on the back to help them learn the more difficult terms. If you use this method, write the definition in your own words because this will help clarify the meaning of the term.</p>
<p>To reinforce the tutorial concepts, you will do assignments in an online homework system (<em><strong>Mastering Biology</strong></em>).&nbsp; There are three kinds of assignments:&nbsp; Quick Checks that are intended to allow you to see if you understand the basics of the course material, homework assignments that will explore the topics more fully and are typically due after we discuss the material in class, and a quiz before each lecture exam.&nbsp; All of the due dates for these assignments are included in your lecture syllabus as well as on the calendar in <em>Mastering Biology</em>.</p>
<p>Being successful in a college course requires a different set of learning strategies than is required for a high school course and you will most likely need to adjust your learning habits accordingly.&nbsp; In general, college-level coursework requires you to be <strong>metacognitive</strong>.&nbsp; This means that you are have achieved the ability to understand what you know about the course content and what you do not know.&nbsp; Penn State has many resources available to help you improve your metacognitive learning strategies.&nbsp; These include:</p>
<p><a href="https://dus.psu.edu/academicsuccess/studyskills.html" target="_blank">Study Skills Modules from DUS</a></p>
<p><a href="http://istudy.psu.edu/tutorials/" target="_blank">iStudy for Success! Online Learning Tutorials</a> (pay particular attention to the tutorial titled "Active Reading")</p>
<p><a href="http://science.psu.edu/advising/success/studyskills.html" target="_blank">The Eberly College of Science Study Skills</a></p>
<p>In addition, this course uses Learning Assistants (LAs).&nbsp; LAs are undergraduate students who have successfully completed this course and are here to help you learn the course material and improve your metacognition and learning strategies.</p>
<p>The LAs are familiar with the learning strategies from the<a href="http://www.learningscientists.org/" target="_blank"> LearningScientists.org</a>. This is a group of cognitive psychological scientists interested in research on education. Their main research focus is on the science of learning and they have put together some helpful tools to help you improve your learning strategies.&nbsp; The short video below is a useful place to start developing your skills!</p>
