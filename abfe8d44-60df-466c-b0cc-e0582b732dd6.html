<p>Members of Kingdom Rhodophyta differ from other eukaryotic algae because they do not have flagellated cells at any point in their life cycles. DNA sequence data (and other sources) indicate that this lineage arose independently, sometime before Kingdom Stramenopila.

<p>Most&nbsp;<strong>rhodophytes</strong>&nbsp;are marine algae, but a number of species live in freshwater and some even inhabit terrestrial niches. Like many of the photosynthetic eukaryotes, rhodophytes are characterized by accessory pigments in their chloroplasts, which endow them with unique colors. In the case of rhodophytes, also called red algae, pigments called&nbsp;<strong>phycobilins</strong>&nbsp;produce rich shades of pink, scarlet, and red that are so deep that they approach black. &nbsp;These &nbsp;red pigments allow rhodophytes to photosynthesize at water depths &nbsp;that only high-energy blue and green light can penetrate. In fact, the color of rhodophyte species tends to be correlated with the depth where they commonly occur; deep-water species are often nearly black whereas shallow-water species can contain so few accessory pigments that they appear almost green, having few pigments to mask the green color of chlorophyll.

<p>Many red algae are large multicellular organisms, although they are not in the same size class as the largest of the brown algae. A number of these species are of economic importance; the odds are very good that you've eaten red algae or that you have relied on its derivatives. The seaweed used in sushi (nori) is a red alga.
