<h3 id="PlantsII-VascularNon-floweringPlants-IntroductionandLearningObjectives">Introduction and Learning Objectives</h3>
<p>By now you should have a good understanding of the advantages and challenges faced by plants living on land. The previous tutorial introduced you to the adaptations to terrestrial environments seen generally in&nbsp;plants and specifically in&nbsp;the nonvascular plants. &nbsp;Now you will examine the seedless vascular plants, which in addition to a waxy cuticle and stomata, have a well-developed vascular tissue. This tutorial will&nbsp;also discuss&nbsp;the evolution of seed plants (gymnosperms and angiosperms), and will cover the&nbsp;nonflowering seed plants, the gymnosperms.&nbsp;By the end of this tutorial you should have a working understanding of:</p>
<ul><li>The evolution of&nbsp;vascular plants</li><li>The importance of vascular tissue</li><li>The advantages of a dominant sporophyte</li><li>The life cycle of seedless vascular plants</li><li>The three groups (lycophytes, sphenophytes, and pterophytes) of seedless vascular&nbsp;plants</li><li>Alternation of generations in seed plants</li><li>The importance of seeds and pollen to land plants</li><li>The four divisions of nonflowering seed plants (gymnosperms)</li><li>The life cycle of nonflowering seed plants</li></ul>
<p>Performance objectives:</p>
<ul><li>Identify the characteristics of&nbsp;vascular plants</li><li>Explain the importance of vascular tissue as an adaptation to drier terrestrial environments</li><li>Identify the characteristic of seedless vascular plants</li><li>Diagram the life cycle of a fern, a homosporous plant, and identify the dominant stage in the life cycle</li><li>Describe the adaptations in seed plants that allow them to be successful in drier terrestrial environments</li><li>Identify the characteristics of non-flowering seed plants (the gymnosperms)</li><li>Explain the changes in the relationship among the Earthâ€™s tectonic plates that occurred at the time the gymnosperms arose</li><li>Summarize the life cycle of a conifer, a heterosporous plant, and identify the dominant stage in the life cycle</li><li>Identify the major characteristic(s) of each group within the gymnosperms and be able to discuss representatives that demonstrate the diversity of the group and the evolutionary trends seen within the gymnosperms</li></ul>
