<p>The bacterium&nbsp;<em>Clostridium botulinum</em>&nbsp;produces one of the most potent human toxins known â€“ the botulism toxin. This toxin has the effect of inhibiting the neurotransmitter acetylcholine which is required for a nerve to stimulate a muscle. As a result, a person who has ingested the botulism toxin suffers from flaccid paralysis which can lead to death. (Cosmetic surgeons have taken advantage of the actions of this toxin to use in the control of wrinkles. The toxin, at low concentrations, interferes with the underlying muscles' ability to contract which smoothes out wrinkles, particularly between the eyes and on the forehead).</p>
<p><em>Clostridium botulinum</em>&nbsp;is an anaerobic gram positive bacterium. The actively growing cells are intolerant of oxygen (in other words, exposure to too much oxygen is lethal to these bacteria) but they can form resistant spores that withstand exposure to O<sub>2</sub>. &nbsp;Sporulation can only occur in anaerobic environments and the neurotoxin is only produced during sporulation.&nbsp; &nbsp;This bacterium is widely distributed in soil, sediments of lakes and ponds, and decaying vegetation. Illness and death due to&nbsp;<em>Clostridium</em>&nbsp;is not due to an infection but rather intoxication as a result of consuming the toxin (the bacterium itself does not cause illness but the neurotoxin it produces does).</p>
<p>In the United States, one of the most common routes of exposure to the botulism toxin is due to the consumption of improperly canned foods. Some people have expressed concern that&nbsp;<em>Clostridium</em>&nbsp;<em>botulinum</em>&nbsp;could be used in a terrorist attack.What advantage does sporulation provide the&nbsp;<em>Clostridium botulinum</em>&nbsp;bacterium?</p>
