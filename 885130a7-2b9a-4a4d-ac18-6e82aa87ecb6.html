<p id="ProkaryotesII-StructureandFunction-TheProkaryoticCellWallandPeptidoglycan">The cells of all organisms (including prokaryotes) are encased in a plasma membrane, which consists of a phospholipid bilayer that is selectively permeable. This bilayer keeps salts and liquids in balance inside the cell by engulfing needed particles and ridding the cell of wastes. In addition to a plasma membrane, many organisms (including plants, fungi, and some protists) also have cell walls. These walls are involved in maintaining cell shape and protection.&nbsp; Most prokaryotes have cell walls, but they are structurally different than those of the plants, fungi, and protists (Archaea have unique molecules in their cell walls and cell membranes that we wonâ€™t discuss here).</p>

<p>Gram's stain is used to differentiate bacteria, based upon the amount of peptidoglycan in their cell walls.</p>
<p>The cell walls of Bacteria contain some amount of&nbsp;<strong>peptidoglycan</strong>, which is a polymer consisting of sugar and polypeptides. If one were attempting to identify bacteria, one might first examine them under a microscope to detect whether the specimens were rod-shaped, round, or spiral. Then one might analyze the amount of peptidoglycan in the cell walls of the unknown organisms by using a technique known as&nbsp;<strong>Gram's stain</strong>.</p>
<p>Bacteria containing a lot of peptidoglycan in their cell walls also tend to have less complex cell walls, and are called&nbsp;<strong>gram-positive</strong>&nbsp;bacteria. Conversely,&nbsp;<strong>gram-negative</strong>&nbsp;bacteria have less peptidoglycan, but have more complex cell walls overall. In particular, the gram-negative bacteria have an additional outer membrane with attached&nbsp;<strong>lipopolysaccharides</strong>.</p>
<p>Some of these lipopolysaccharides are toxic, serving to counteract the natural defenses of the host organism. Also, the additional membrane of gram-negative bacteria can make them more resistant to antibacterial medications (<strong>antibiotics</strong>). For these two reasons, a gram-negative bacterial infection can be far more severe than a gram-positive infection.</p>
<h2 id="ProkaryotesII-StructureandFunction-TheCapsuleandPilus">The Capsule and Pilus</h2>
<p>Numerous adaptations have evolved in host organisms to fight bacterial infections, and the numerous counter adaptations by bacteria to evade these adaptive defenses, have resulted in bacteria that are skilled at survival in inhospitable conditions. In addition to cell walls and cell membranes, many bacteria have an additional layer outside the cell wall termed the&nbsp;<strong>capsule</strong>. Capsules are sticky substances made and secreted by a bacterium, and they help bacteria adhere to surfaces or to each other. Capsules also provide an additional layer of protection to the encapsulated organism.</p>
<p>Recall from the last tutorial that pili can provide an avenue for exchange of genetic information. Some prokaryotes also use these surface appendages for attachment to a variety of substrates. For example,&nbsp;<em>Neisseria gonorrhoeae </em>attaches to the epithelium within the reproductive tract via pili, where they can inflict individuals with the sexually transmitted disease (STD) that carries the species name. Mutant strains that lack pili are nonpathogenic.</p>
