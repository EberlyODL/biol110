<p>Mendel was able interpret the results of his genetic crosses because he took careful notes, made accurate counts, and chose traits that exhibited a clear dominant or recessive expression pattern. In fact, alleles that show simple dominant or recessive expression patterns are sometimes called "Mendelian traits".&nbsp; Many alleles, however, do not behave in such a simple Mendelian manner. This tutorial will explore more complex patterns of expression as well as the application of genetic principles to the development of pedigrees. By the end of this tutorial you should have a basic understanding of:
</p>
<ul><li>
  Genes with multiple alleles
  </li><li>
  The distinctions between the three types of dominance
  </li><li>
  How genes can have multiple effects
  </li><li>
  How genes can affect the expression of other genes
  </li><li>
  How some characters are controlled by more than one gene
  </li><li>
  Pedigree analysis
  </li><li>
  Cystic fibrosis
  </li><li>
  Huntington's disease
  </li><li>
  Sickle-cell disease
  </li><li>
  Phenylketonuria
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Performance Objectives
