<p>The best evidence about the origin of life and the evolution of living organisms comes from the fossil record. <strong>Fossils</strong> can be preserved remnants of organisms (e.g., bones and teeth) or whole organisms embedded in amber, acid bogs and tar pits, or anywhere bacteria can't decompose a dead body. The fossil record is not complete and has gaps. This is, in part, because not all organisms are equally likely to fossilize. Organisms with hard body parts fossilized more often than those who lacked hard body parts. Organisms that lived near water and in areas of low oxygen were also more likely to form fossils than organisms who lived away from water. Organisms from large populations are typically more common in the fossil record than organisms from small populations; however, if none of the other conditions are in place, large population size is less&nbsp;important.&nbsp; Fossils can also be found in other forms (e.g., an animal's footprint). A scientist who studies fossils is a paleontologist. Fossils are divided into age groups according to a <strong>geological time scale</strong>, a classification of different periods in Earth’s history. For example, layers of rock bearing evidence of the origin of most modern animal phyla would be classified as belonging to the Cambrian period in the Paleozoic era. Layers of rock bearing fossils suggest a rapid diversification of reptiles took place during the Permian period in the Paleozoic era. While you will not need to know the different periods and epochs for this course, you should be familiar with the four great eras of the geological time scale: Precambrian (oldest), Paleozoic, Mesozoic, and Cenozoic; and you should know that we are currently in the Quaternary period of the Cenozoic era.</p>

<h2>Relative Dating</h2>
<p>The best source of fossils is <strong>sedimentary rock</strong>, which is formed by layers of minerals that settle out of water. Over time these minerals build up and pack the layers lying beneath them, along with any organisms that have settled with the sediments. The figure below summarizes the major events associated with the formation of sedimentary rock. Note that each stratum, or layer, represents a particular period in Earth's history and is characterized by a collection of fossils of organisms that lived at that time. The location of fossils in sedimentary rock is indicative of their relative age. This means that one fossil can generally be classified as older than another based on their relative position in the sedimentary rock. Deeper layers were formed earlier and their fossils are older than those found in more shallow layers of rock. This method of estimating the relative age of a fossil is known as <strong>relative dating</strong>.</p>

<h2>Absolute Dating</h2>
<p>A variety of methods are used to estimate a fossil's age in years, rather than simply in relative terms. These absolute dating methods include radiometric dating and dendrochronology. These methods will be explored below.</p>
<h2>Radiometric Dating</h2>
<p>The identity of a particular atom is determined by the number of protons it has in its nucleus. However, a collection of atoms of a particular element can have varying numbers of neutrons. For example, hydrogen atoms can have no neutrons (the most common form, sometimes called protium), one neutron (deuterium) or two neutrons (tritium). These are hydrogen's three <strong>isotopes</strong>. Moreover, different isotopes have different (but predictable) stabilities. Many elements have radioactive isotopes; their nuclei decay at predictable rates (unique for each isotope) and give off energy and atomic particles. When the decay leads to a change in the number of protons, it transforms the atom to an atom of a different element. For example, potassium-40 decays from a radioactive parent atom to a stable daughter atom of argon-40. Scientists have identified several elements with radioactive isotopes that decay at known rates; they can be used to date various rocks, including those containing fossils. This procedure is known as <strong>radiometric dating</strong>, and as mentioned earlier, this absolute dating method has been used to date material as old as meteorites. Let's take a closer look at how this method works.</p>
<p>[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=2984|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__right__lightboxed]</p>
<p>This graph illustrates how, over time, radioactive parent atoms decay and the number of stable daughter atoms, relative to the number of parent atoms, increases exponentially. Note how the two lines intersect at the first <strong>half-life</strong>&nbsp;point. In other words, a radioisotope's half-life is the amount of time it takes for one-half of the parental atom population to decay into daughter atoms. It takes 1.25 billion years for half of the potassium-40 in a sample to decay to argon-40; in other words, the half-life of potassium-40 is 1.25 billion years. Because living things contain so much carbon, radiometric dating using carbon-14 (C<sup>14</sup>), also called <strong>radiocarbon dating</strong>&nbsp;or <strong>carbon-14 dating</strong>, is quite common. What does carbon-14 decay into? Do a web search to find the answer to this question.</p>
<h2>How Do We Know That C-14 Dating is Accurate?</h2>
<p>So how does subatomic physics help establish an absolute dating method for fossils? Easy, well in theory at least; the technical details of how this is done can be a bit complex. As long as an organism is alive, it incorporates C<sup>14</sup>and C<sup>12</sup> into its body. Once an organism dies it no longer takes up new <sup>14</sup>C and the <sup>14</sup>C already in its tissues radioactively decays. The <sup>12</sup>C in its tissues remains the same because it is not radioactive and does not decay. By measuring the ratio of <sup>14</sup>C to <sup>12</sup>C and comparing it to the ratio of <sup>14</sup>C to <sup>12</sup>C present originally in the atmosphere, scientists can calculate the age of a fossil. The rate at which carbon decays (its half-life) is approximately 5730 years. After about 50,000 years, the amount of C<sup>14</sup> remaining is so small that material can't be dated reliably (although some specialized samples have been dated to about 75,000 years). How do we know this radiometric “clock” is accurate? In order to have confidence in a scientific fact, corroboration is required. In other words, without an independent means of verifying a fact, its scientific value is questionable. The more a fact is checked using different methods, the more reliable the scientific community judges that fact. Many experiments have verified the usefulness and accuracy of carbon-14 dating. For example, archaeologists know from the historical record the age of various Egyptian tombs. Wood taken from these tombs has been dated using the carbon-14 dating method, and the two dates agree. In addition, the argon/potassium-40 dating method has been used to date the time of the Mount Vesuvius eruption in Italy, and this date coincides with the date reported by Roman historians. Many other corroborative dates have validated the use of radiometric methods.</p>
<h2>Dendrochronology</h2>
<p><strong>Dendrochronology</strong>&nbsp;is also an absolute dating technique. This science relies on the fact that trees have annual growth rings that reflect the age of the tree – one ring is produced each year. The width of the ring may vary, depending on variations in water and sunlight; a tree ring from a dry year will be more narrow than a tree ring from a year with abundant rainfall. Therefore, the pattern of the rings can also often reveal something about past climate conditions. Remarkably, global fluctuations of weather patterns appear to be the best indicators of annual growth ring changes; growth rings from wood obtained from Egyptian tombs has been matched to tree growth ring patterns found in ancient trees located in California. This figure depicts the basic strategy used to date a piece of wood. Dendrochronology and radiometric dating have been used to date many bristlecone pine trees in the White Mountains of California. The oldest tree has been named Methuselah, and dendrochronology and carbon-14 dating methods have determined the tree to be 4,844 years old. Moreover, by matching tree growth ring patterns with dead wood laying in the vicinity, a tree growth ring catalog has been created that spans back 9,000 years.</p>
