<p>From a geneticist's point of view, a population composed of hundreds or thousands of individuals is less likely to evolve than a small population. The larger the population, the more of a buffer there is against random variations in allele frequencies; an infinite size population would be almost completely resistant to random fluctuations. In contrast, small populations are especially vulnerable to the loss of genetic variability due to random events; in fact, they may evolve into extinction.</p>
<p></p>
<h2 id="PopulationGeneticsandEvolution-EvolutioninSmallPopulations:GeneticDrift">Evolution in Small Populations: Genetic Drift</h2>
<p>Small populations are much more likely to experience&nbsp;<strong>genetic drift</strong>&nbsp;(random fluctuations of allele and genotype frequencies) than are large populations. If a population has an allele frequency of&nbsp;<em>p</em>&nbsp;= 0.25 or 1/4, then the allele frequency of&nbsp;<em>q</em>&nbsp;is 1 - 0.25 = 0.75 or 3/4. (Remember, the sum of all individual allele frequencies for a particular gene must add up to 1.) Therefore, for each&nbsp;<em>p</em>&nbsp;allele, there are 3&nbsp;<em>q</em>&nbsp;alleles in the population (or a 1:3 ratio). If a population consists of 1000 individuals and 1000 X 2 = 2000 alleles, then 500 of the alleles in the gene pool would be&nbsp;<em>p</em>&nbsp;(2 X 250) and 1500 of the alleles would be&nbsp;<em>q</em>&nbsp;(2 X 750). If the alleles in the next generation are counted, they may have drifted by five alleles (e.g., to 505 and 1495), but the new allele frequencies would be 0.253 and 0.748, which are very close to the original values of 0.25 and 0.75. Although there is very small &nbsp;measurable change, it would take many generations before one allele became fixed in the population and the other eliminated.</p>
<p>However, if the population in the example above contained only 10 individuals (2 X 10 = 20 alleles) and the initial allele frequencies were again&nbsp;<em>p</em>&nbsp;= 0.25 and&nbsp;<em>q</em>&nbsp;= 0.75, then there would be 5&nbsp;<em>p</em>&nbsp;alleles (2 X 2.5) and 15&nbsp;<em>q</em>&nbsp;alleles (2 X 7.5) in the population. If the next generation also drifted by five alleles, then there would be 10&nbsp;<em>p</em>&nbsp;alleles (5 + 5) and 10&nbsp;<em>q</em>&nbsp;alleles (15 - 5). Therefore, in one generation the allele frequencies would go from 0.25 and 0.75 to 0.5 and 0.5. If both alleles are selectively neutral (have no effect on fitness), then each faces a probability of being lost in the course of several generations, and eventually one allele will become fixed in the population. Heterozygosity at that gene would become zero and the genetic variation within the population would be reduced.</p>
<p>Next we'll examine the two major situations that restrict population size and lead to genetic drift.</p>
<p></p>
<h2 id="PopulationGeneticsandEvolution-GeneticDriftandtheBottleneckEffect">Genetic Drift and the Bottleneck Effect</h2>
<p>One situation that can result in genetic drift is the&nbsp;<strong>bottleneck effect</strong>. A bottleneck event (e.g., earthquakes, fires, over-hunting) decimates a population and results in only a small &nbsp;number of individuals surviving. In a bottleneck event, the remaining, random survivors may not have the same allele and genotype frequencies as the original population. In the new population, some alleles may be found at higher frequencies, whereas others may be found at lower frequencies or even lost altogether.</p>
<p>In a small but rapidly reproducing population, genetic drift will typically affect the population for a number of generations until the population size becomes &nbsp;large enough that genetic drift is negligible. While natural disasters have historically been the cause of bottleneck effects, overzealous hunting can also cause this effect.</p>
<p>[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3452|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__right__lightboxed]</p>
<p>Many endangered species, such as the cheetah (seen at right) and the American bison, provide examples of bottleneck events and reduced genetic variation. Among cheetahs, all &nbsp;living individuals are genetically very similar, which &nbsp;means this surviving population has less genetic variation upon which selection can act. Even when a species, such as the cheetah, is protected following a bottleneck event, the loss of genetic variability may make the species more likely to go extinct. Genetically homogeneous populations are more prone to catastrophes because a given insult (e.g., a disease or a predator) can sweep through the entire population quickly; without variation, there is nothing for natural selection to act on. &nbsp;Therefore, conservation efforts must not only preserve numbers, they must also promote genetic variability. Only when some individuals are better suited to the environment than others, can evolution increase the adaptation of a population to its environment. Perhaps the potential to undergo natural selection is one of the best measures of a healthy population.</p>
<p>There is reason to think that bottleneck effects might play a major role in extinction. There is evidence that major catastrophic events (e.g., meteor strikes) might have led to major bottleneck effects in Earth's past. Such events might not have necessarily killed off all members of a species (e.g., dinosaurs), but might have decimated their population enough such that they became genetically weakened due to a loss in variability; eventually these populations died out. One book with a catchy title,&nbsp;<u>Extinction: Bad Genes or Bad Luck?</u>&nbsp;by David M. Raup, explores this idea.</p>

<h2 id="PopulationGeneticsandEvolution-GeneticDriftandtheFounderEffect">Genetic Drift and the Founder Effect</h2>
<p>[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3456|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__right__lightboxed]</p>
<p>Another situation that can result in genetic drift is the&nbsp;<strong>founder effect</strong>. A founder event occurs when a few individuals (founding individuals) become geographically separated from the original population and &nbsp;form a new population. The alleles present in the founding individuals make up the gene pool of this new population. Most likely, the founding individuals will not have the same allele and genotype frequencies of the original population, nor will they possess all of the variation present in the original population. Because it will take several generations before their population &nbsp;increases much in size, genetic drift would continue to influence the allele frequencies in the population. This effect can be seen when remote islands are colonized.</p>
<p></p>
<p>An example of the founder effect in human populations occurred on the island of Tristan da Cunha. This island was settled in the 1800's by fifteen British immigrants. There have only been a couple of migrations since; today there are just seven surnames on this island that has about 250 inhabitants. Expectedly, this leads to problems associated with&nbsp;<strong>inbreeding</strong>&nbsp;(the mating of closely related individuals). One notable problem is the occurrence of retinitis pigmentosa (a rare form of blindness), which occurs at a much higher frequency in this population than in the original population. &nbsp;Some questions in the tutorial quiz &nbsp;will use this genetic disorder to illustrate how the founder effect alters the frequency of alleles in a small human population.</p>
