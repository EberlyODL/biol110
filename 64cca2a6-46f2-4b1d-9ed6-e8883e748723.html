<p>Water (H<sub>2</sub>O) is fundamental to the existence of life as we know it. Indeed, it is so familiar to us that we take its properties for granted. What makes water so important? What is the relationship between water and other biomolecules? In order to answer these questions we need to take a close look at water and at some of the properties of its electrons, which have a profound influence on its character.</p>
<p>As you have probably already learned, a single molecule of water consists of two hydrogen atoms covalently bound to one oxygen atom. This arrangement does not sound very exciting; however, a closer examination of the bonds within the water molecule reveals something unique. Specifically, water is a&nbsp;<strong>polar</strong>&nbsp;molecule, meaning that it has different electrical properties on opposite ends; specifically, it has two partial positive charges in association with the two H-atoms, and two partial negative charges associated with the oxygen atom.

<p>To understand these properties, you need to know that not all&nbsp;<strong>covalent bonds</strong>&nbsp;(those bonds that involve the sharing of electrons) are equal. Specifically, oxygen is highly&nbsp;<strong>electronegative</strong>&nbsp;and tends to pull electrons close to it when forming covalent bonds with hydrogen. This creates an unequal distribution around each O-H bond; therefore, the hydrogen has a partial positive charge (and conversely, the oxygen has a slightly negative character). Importantly, the partial negative charges on one water molecule can interact with the partial positive charges on another water molecule to form a&nbsp;<strong>hydrogen bond</strong>.&nbsp; See the image above to see the structure of a water molecule as well as how individual water molecules interact with each other via hydrogen bonds (the h-bonds are indicated with the dashed lines). Hydrogen bonds contribute to many of the unique features of water.</p>
