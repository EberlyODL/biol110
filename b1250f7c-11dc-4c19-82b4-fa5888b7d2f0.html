<p>Nitrogen is found in all proteins and nucleic acids, hence it is essential to all forms of life. This atom is abundant in the air around us in the form of atmospheric nitrogen. However, nitrogen availability is a problem because nitrogen, in its elemental form (N<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;gas), is not usable by most organisms. Nitrogen can only be transformed into a biologically usable state (i.e., "fixed") by certain nitrogen-fixing bacteria, in a process termed&nbsp;<strong>nitrogen fixation</strong>. "Nitrogen-fixers" live in the aquatic environment, the soil, and in or around the roots and stems of certain species of plants.
</p>
<p>Nitrogen gas (also known as dinitrogen or N<sub>2</sub>) is converted to ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>) by nitrogen-fixing bacteria. The fixed nitrogen is then used by plants (and other soil- and aquatic-dwelling microorganisms) in various anabolic pathways leading to the synthesis of proteins, nucleic acids, and other nitrogenous molecules.

  Bacteria, housed in these root nodules, fix nitrogen for this soybean plant.
</p>
<p>Plants, the primary energy producers in the terrestrial environment, are a major repository for fixed nitrogen in the terrestrial biosphere. When a plant is eaten, the herbivore obtains nitrogen in the form of proteins and nucleic acids (which are broken down during digestion and used by the herbivore for the production of its own nitrogen products). When a plant dies, a variety of organisms known as "decomposers" also obtain nitrogen from the nitrogenous compounds previously made by the plant. Finally, fixed nitrogen can be reconverted by soil bacteria back into atmospheric nitrogen. The&nbsp;<strong>nitrogen cycle</strong> is essential for all life on the planet. The previous tutorial briefly introduced the symbiosis that leads to nitrogen fixation. We will now examine this symbiosis in more detail.

<p>Almost all&nbsp;legumes&nbsp;(e.g., peas, alfalfa, and soybeans) are capable of housing nitrogen-fixing bacteria. The plant-prokaryote mutualism (the plant gets fixed nitrogen from the bacteria, while the bacteria get carbon from the plant) that results is determined by a complex series of events that begins with chemical communication between the participating organisms. Plants that participate in these symbioses secrete molecules (e.g., flavonoids) that act as chemical signals to a select species of bacteria. The term&nbsp;rhizobia&nbsp;is applied to several species of bacteria that participate in these symbioses. The targeted rhizobia are induced to respond when the specific chemical signal stimulates specific genes to "turn on." Bacteria then migrate toward the plant's root. Once bacteria reach the root, a developmental change is induced in the root, which results in&nbsp;<strong>nodule</strong>&nbsp;formation. The&nbsp;<em>Rhizobium</em>&nbsp;bacteria take up residence inside the nodule. Thus, the events of nodule formation involve chemical cross-signaling between the two participants. The environment of the plant-derived nodule is favorable for the fixation of nitrogen by the bacteria that live inside.

<p>[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=2384|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__right__lightboxed]In addition to rhizobia/legume symbioses, several other symbiotic nitrogen-fixing symbioses are known. For example, various species of cyanobacteria&nbsp;(often referred to as blue-green algae) are capable of nitrogen fixation. One symbiosis is particularly important to humanity.&nbsp;<em>Anabaena</em>&nbsp;is a Cyanobacterium genus that colonizes on the leaves of an aquatic fern that grows in rice paddies; the symbiosis supplies nitrogen to the pond, where it subsequently is taken up and used by rice plants. About 75% of all rice is cultivated in flooded fields, and this symbiosis has allowed rice farmers to maintain high levels of productivity without the need for expensive chemical fertilizers.
