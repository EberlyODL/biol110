<h2>Protists I Part 3 VoiceThread Transcript</h2>
<p>Slide 1<br>Kingdom Alveolata is a monophyletic kingdom comprised of three main groups of organisms - the ciliates, dinoflagellates, and apicomplexans.</p>
<p>We will see that these three groups of organisms are quite different from each other but this is still considered to be a monophyletic kingdom because all three share a common diagnostic characteristic - the presence of structures known as alveoli.</p>
<p>Alveoli are small cavities enclosed in membranes that hug the internal cell surface.</p>
<p>Slide 2<br>The Ciliates are a group of free-living organisms that are covered with cilia which are small hair-like structures. &nbsp;</p>
<p>A common representative of this group that you may have seen in a previous biology class are the paramercia - common inhabitants of pond water.</p>
<p>The ciliates are heterotrophic and they eat bacteria and other protists.</p>
<p>They make up an important part of the food chain in freshwater systems but they are not known to cause significant problems for humans.</p>
<p>Slide 3<br>The dinoflagellates are a large and ecologically and economically significant group of organisms.</p>
<p>They have two flagella that they use for locomotion and they can have very complex life cycles. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Some are free-living and photosynthetic and some are parasites of other organisms.</p>
<p>The most obviously distinguishing characteristic of this group are the presence of cellulose plates that give the organisms an armored appearance.</p>
<p>Slide 4<br>You can see some of these complex cell structures here.</p>
<p>Slide 5<br>Dinoflagellates are an ecologically important group that are found in both marine and freshwater systems.</p>
<p>Many are photosynthetic and thus form the base of aquatic food webs.</p>
<p>Some photosynthetic forms live within other organisms such as the zooxanthellae dinoflagellates that live in coral reefs.</p>
<p>Some are parasitic within marine animals and cause significant economic damage.</p>
<p>Some dinoflagellates are bioluminescent and luminesce when disturbed as seen in this picture here.</p>
<p>Slide 6<br>The term plankton refers to organisms living on the surface of bodies of water.&nbsp; This plankton can be comprised of bacteria, protists and small animals such as this small species of shrimp known as krill.</p>
<p>Plankton is hugely important for forming the base of the food chain in aquatic systems.&nbsp; To give you an idea of the amount of calories that are found in this plankton we can look at the example of the basking shark.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Basking sharks are huge animals - up to 33 feet long.&nbsp; They are not the scary carnivores we tend to think of when we think of sharks.&nbsp; They eat only plankton - and they feed by filtering the plankton through their large mouths with special filtering structures.</p>
<p>Slide 7<br>The plant-like component of plankton is known as phytoplankton.&nbsp; This is the photosynthetic component of plankton.</p>
<p>Ecologically phytoplankton is important for not only playing a role in food chains but also for its role in global carbon dioxide levels.</p>
<p>Carbon dioxide is an important so called "greenhouse gas" and it plays role in heat retention in the earth's atmosphere.</p>
<p>Some photosynthetic dinoflagellates can experience population "blooms" and produce potent neurotoxins that can poison food webs.</p>
<p>Slide 8<br>Red tides occur when dinoflagellate populations expand rapidly or "bloom".</p>
<p>When this happens the dinoflagellates can produce neurotoxins that can get taken up into the food chain.</p>
<p>For example, shellfish (bivalves) feed (by filtration) on these dinoflagellates and the shellfish concentrate the toxins their tissues.&nbsp; If a person eats these contaminated shellfish it results in a condition known as paralytic shellfish poisoning.</p>
<p>These neurotoxins can also accumulate in fish and result in a similar paralytic condition known as Ciguatera.</p>
<p>Slide 9<br>As an example of the complexity of the life cycles of some of these organisms we can look at a suggested life cycle for an organism know as Pfiesteria.</p>
<p>This is a controversial organism that has been blamed for massive fish dies offs off the coast of North Carolina.&nbsp; There is a video posted on ANGEL that explains the controversy around this organism and is a nice case study on the nature of science.</p>
<p>Slide 10<br>Our final group of alveolates are the apicomplexans.&nbsp; This is a group of heterotrophic parasites.</p>
<p>They have no known means of locomotion and are spread from one host to another as the result of the movement of other organisms.</p>
<p>The distinguishing characteristic of this group is a structure known as an apical complex - which is a dense structure that helps the organism gain entry into a host cell during infection.</p>
<p>Most of the organisms in this group are parasites on invertebrates and we even use some of them to help control insect populations in agriculture.</p>
<p>There is one member of this group, however, that is of huge importance to humans and this is an organism known as plasmodium that causes the disease malaria.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Slide 11<br>Malaria is spread through mosquito bites and plasmodium is an example of an organism with a complex life cycle.</p>
<p>Slide 12<br>Not all species of mosquitos spread malaria - the Anopheles mosquito that is now found mainly in equatorial Africa is the vector.</p>
<p>In 2008, an estimated 190 - 311 million cases of malaria occurred worldwide and 708,000 - 1,003,000 people died, most of them young children in sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
<p>Control efforts have focused on mosquito control but mosquitoes have evolved resistance to many pesticides</p>
<p>Efforts to develop a vaccine have had limited success to date but there is still hope that a vaccine will be developed.</p>
<p>In the meantime, there are low tech and relatively inexpensive means to control the spread of the mosquitoes and thus the disease.&nbsp; Bed nets are an example of this.</p>
<p>Slide 13<br>Nothing But Nets is an effort which brings together multimedia organizations, professional sports leagues, faith-based and civil society organizations, corporations, and foundations to raise funds to send bed nets to sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
<p>Bed nets can be an effective low tech tool&nbsp;</p>
