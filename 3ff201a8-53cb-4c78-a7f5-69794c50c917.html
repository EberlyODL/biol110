<h2>Chromosome Behavior and Gene Linkage Part 2 VoiceThread Transcript</h2><p>Slide 1<br>To further examine the idea of linked genes, we are going to examine a dihybrid cross the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. &nbsp;Fruit flies are common study organisms in genetics laboratories and much of what we know about genetics we owe to the fruit fly.</p><p><br>Slide 2<br>Before we look at one of these crosses, we should review Drosophila nomenclature (you were introduced to this information in the previous tutorial).</p><p>In Drosophila, genes are named after the first mutation that is discovered. &nbsp;For example, normal fruit flies have red eyes (so we say red eyes are the wild-type trait). &nbsp;The first eye color mutation that was found was white eyes. &nbsp;So white eyes are the mutant phenotype.</p><p>If the mutation is recessive, as is the case with the allele for white eyes, gene is symbolized with a lowercase letter - in this example, little w.</p><p>The wild-type allele is always indicated with a plus sign - so in this example w+ is the wild-type allele and w is the mutant allele.</p><p><br>Slide 3<br>This particular dihybrid cross includes the genes for body color (wild-type is gray and the mutant is black) and wing size (wild-type is normal and the mutant trait is vestigial wings - vestigial wings are small non-functional wings).</p><p>All of the fruit fly crosses in this unit on linked genes will be set up exactly the same way - a female who is heterozygous for both genes (so she is wild-type body color, wild-type wing size) is crossed with a homozygous recessive male. &nbsp;You can see the genotypes of the parents here.</p><p>For the moment, assume that these genes are not linked and they assort independently. &nbsp;If this is the case - what gametes can these parents make?</p><p><br>Slide 4<br>If the genes are not linked, the heterozygous female can make four different gamete types in a 1:1:1:1 ratio. &nbsp;The male is homozygous recessive so he can only make single gamete type.</p><p>Let's take this assumption to the next step and predict the offspring that will result from this cross.</p><p><br>Slide 5<br>A Punnett square can help us visualize the offspring - along the top axis are the female's gametes and along the side is the male's single gamete type. &nbsp;</p><p>This cross can produce four types of offspring - in a 1:1:1:1 ratio. &nbsp;Remember, we are assuming that the genes are not linked and they assort independently during meiosis.</p><p>Slide 6<br>If we look again at the image from this tutorial, we see these four categories of offspring. &nbsp;If the genes are not linked and they assort independently - then we expect these four categories of offspring to occur in approximately equal numbers.</p><p>If we observe something significantly different from a 1:1:1:1 ratio - then we know that our assumption was incorrect and the genes do not assort independently and are linked. &nbsp;This cross allowed us to determine that the gene for body color and wing size are linked.</p><p><br>Slide 7<br>Remember, linked genes are on the same chromosome and closer than 50 map units apart. &nbsp;Because they are on the same chromosome, they cannot assort independently.</p><p>These crosses can be used to determine more than whether or not two genes are linked. &nbsp;We can also use these crosses to determine the distance between the two genes so that we can ultimately create a genetic map.</p><p><br>Slide 8<br>Remember, linked genes can recombine into new combinations as a result of crossing over. &nbsp;The recombination frequency of linked genes provides information about the distance between two genes. &nbsp;We can set up crosses that allow us to determine recombination frequencies and thus distance.</p><p><br>Slide 9<br>Here is another view of our previous cross if a heterozygous female and a homozygous recessive male. &nbsp;This image adds details about how the alleles are arranged on the chromosomes. &nbsp;In this particular female, the two wild-type alleles are found on one chromosome and the two mutant alleles are found on its homologous partner. &nbsp;During meiosis, crossing over recombines the alleles on two of the non-sister chromatids to create a a chromatid with the genotype b+ vg and a chromatid with the genotype b vg+. &nbsp;Meiosis II separates the sister chromatids into individual gametes and we see the four different gamete types - b+ vg, b+ vg+, b vg+, and b vg. &nbsp;However, they are not in a 1:1:1:1 ratio. &nbsp;The gametes that reflect the parental arrangement of alleles (b+vg+ and bvg) occur more frequently than the recombinant arrangement. &nbsp;We call the orignal arrangement the parental gametes and those that result from crossing over are the recombinant gametes. &nbsp;This means that we call the offspring that result from the parental gametes - parental and those that result from the recombinant gametes are recombinant offspring.</p><p>To determine the distance between the gene for body color and wing size - you use the equation shown here - divide the # of recombinant offspring by the total number of offspring and multiply by 100. &nbsp;This gives the recombination frequency which we can use as a measure of distance.</p><p><br>Slide 10<br>The gene for body color is 17 map units from the gene for wing size.</p><p><br>Slide 11<br>By doing crosses like this one, we can create a linkage map which provides the order and relative position of genes along a chromosome.</p>
