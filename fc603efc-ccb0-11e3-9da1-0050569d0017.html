<h2>Introduction and Goals</h2>
<p>This tutorial emphasizes the work of Gregor Mendel, the father of modern genetics. Mendel was the first scientist to examine, in a quantitative manner, the behavior of traits between generations. By looking at the proportions of progeny, he was able to infer the basic tenets of modern genetics. By the conclusion of this tutorial you should have a basic understanding of:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Mendel and modern genetics</li>
	<li>The distinction between characters and traits</li>
	<li>Meiosis and the segregation of alleles</li>
	<li>The molecular relationship between genotype and phenotype</li>
	<li>The laws of segregation and independent assortment</li>
</ul>

Johann Gregor Mendel"><img alt="" class="lightbox" src="/courses/biol110/sites/edu.courses.biol110/files/images/Tutorial3_Figure1Mendel.jpg" style="width: 136px; height: 179px;" /></a>Johann Gregor Mendel was born in 1822 and was raised on his parents small farm, in what is now the Czech Republic. After attending high school and the Olmutz Philosophical Institute, Mendel became a friar at an Augustinian monastery in Brno in 1843 at the age of 21. After several years of theological study, Mendel failed his teacher&#39;s examination and was sent to the University of Vienna (Austria) for two years of study from 1851-1853.</p>
<p>He returned to the monastery and began his studies of inheritance with pea plants (<em>Pisum</em>) grown in the monastery&#39;s garden. He published his work in 1865; however, it went largely unnoticed until its rediscovery in 1900, sixteen years after his death. Mendel&#39;s experiments demonstrated many of the basic principles of genetics, and so, his studies are used to illustrate the first principles of inheritance.</p>
<h2>Characters (Genes) and Traits (Alleles)</h2>
<p>Mendel probably chose to work with pea plants because of the many variants that exist in their <strong>morphology</strong> (physical appearance). The color of the flowers, seeds, and pods can differ between individuals, as well as the position of the flower on the stem, the length of the stem, and the shape of the seeds and pods. <em>Pisum</em> provided Mendel with a wide variety of characteristics with which to examine patterns of inheritance. At this point, we need to introduce the terms that Mendel referred to as a character and a trait.</p>
<p>Mendel defined a character as a heritable feature for which variants exist, and a trait as a particular variant for the character. For example, flower color is a character, whereas purple and white are traits. Today, we use the term "gene" to refer to a character and "allele" to refer to a trait.&nbsp; For example, in pea plants there is a gene for flower color and the two alleles are purple and white. Other characters (and traits) that he studied included: seed color (yellow or green); seed shape (round or wrinkled); pod shape (inflated or restricted); flower position (terminal or axial); and plant height (tall or dwarf).&nbsp;</p>

<p>This figure illustrates the relationship between genotypes and phenotypes, with flower color used as an example. An organism&#39;s <strong>genotype</strong> is its genetic makeup for a particular trait; that is, a listing of its alleles at a given location. The <strong>phenotype</strong> is the organism&#39;s appearance; that is, the trait produced by the alleles at the location for that trait. How does the genotype for a trait lead to the phenotype? The different alleles at a given location differ in their DNA sequences, thereby producing different enzymes when transcribed into RNA. These enzymes can have different levels of activity; therefore, the organism&#39;s phenotype will differ depending on the enzymes present. The manner in which gene products interact to determine the phenotype is usually complex. The example provided below should help to clarify the relationship between genotype and phenotype.</p>
<p>In peas, the character "flower color" has two traits: the dominant purple flower and the recessive white flower.&nbsp; The <strong>dominant allele</strong> <em>P</em> codes for a functional enzyme that creates a pigment that makes the flower purple. The <strong>recessive allele</strong> <em>p</em>, however, has a defect in its DNA sequence and results in a nonfunctional enzyme - no pigment is produced and the flower appears white. .</p>
<p>In individuals with two copies of the recessive allele (<em>pp</em>), have white flowers because both copies of their allele code for nonfunctional pigment-producing enzyme.&nbsp; An individual that is <em>PP</em> or <em>Pp</em>, on the other hand, has at least one functional version of the pigment-producing allele and thus has purple flowers.</p>
<h2>Mendel&#39;s Technique for Crossing Peas</h2>
<p><a href="https://online.science.psu.edu/sites/default/files/biol110/Tutorial3_Figure2GeneticCross.jpg" onclick="return hs.expand(this)" style="float: right; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px;" title="Figure 2. A Genetic Cross"><img alt="Figure 2. Genetic Cross" class="lightbox" src="https://online.science.psu.edu/sites/default/files/biol110/Tutorial3_Figure2GeneticCross.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 335px; margin: 10px; float: right;" /></a>In addition to Pisum&#39;s variety of characters and traits with which to study patterns of inheritance, Mendel also probably chose to study peas because their reproduction can be easily controlled, which afforded him strict control over the mating of different individuals. The general process is shown in this figure. Peas will often <strong>self-fertilize</strong> (also termed "selfing"), transferring pollen from the stamens to the carpel on the same flower. The ease by which peas can be "selfed" played an important role in Mendel&#39;s studies. In some cases, Mendel wanted to cross plants with different traits. This required that he prevent selfing by removing the immature stamens before they produced pollen; he then brushed the carpel with pollen from another individual. This enabled him to control the fertilization process, and therefore the parentage of each individual. The pollinated carpel matured into a pod, and the seeds within the pod were planted to give rise to a new generation of adult plants. The mature plants (produced by the seeds) were then examined for traits, and the process repeated again as desired. This manipulation made it possible for Mendel to keep track of the parents of each individual, and to examine how traits were transmitted through generations.</p>
<h2>Mendel&#39;s Crosses</h2>
<p><a class="highslide" href="/courses/biol110/sites/edu.courses.biol110/files/images/Tutorial%203%20Figure%203%20Genetic%20Crosses%20F3.jpg" onclick="return hs.expand(this)" style="float: left; margin: 10px 10px 0px 0px;" title="Figure 3. Genetic Crosses"><img alt="Figure 3. Genetic Crosses F3" class="lightbox" src="https://online.science.psu.edu/sites/default/files/biol110/Tutorial%203%20Figure%203%20Genetic%20Crosses%20F3.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 351px; margin: 10px; float: left;" /></a>Mendel tracked heritable characters for three generations. In the first generation, the <strong>P generation</strong> (parental generation), Mendel crossed two "<strong>true-breeding</strong>" parents with differing traits for one or more characters. "True-breeding" means that all of the offspring of that individual have the same trait as the parent when the offspring are produced by self-pollination. In this figure, the individual with white flowers was true-breeding because all of the offspring produced from a self-pollination had white flowers. Similarly, the individual with purple flowers only produced offspring with purple flowers when self-pollinated.</p>
<p>The crossing of two true-breeding parents produced an <strong>F</strong><strong><sub>1</sub></strong> <strong>generation</strong> of hybrid individuals that exhibited only the trait found in one of the two parents. The trait that was expressed in the F<sub>1</sub> generation was termed a <strong>dominant trait</strong>. The F<sub>1</sub> generation hybrids were then each self-pollinated, producing an <strong>F</strong><strong><sub>2</sub></strong> <strong>generation</strong>. Although not present in the F<sub>1</sub> generation, the trait exhibited by the one parent reappeared in this generation, invariably at approximately a 3:1 ratio of one parental trait to the other. The trait that reappeared in the F<sub>2</sub> generation was termed a <strong>recessive trait</strong> because it receded in the previous generation. Mendel counted large numbers (hundreds to thousands) of offspring in the F<sub>2</sub> generation, allowing him to analyze his results mathematically; from which he determined the mode and manner of inheritance in this species.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2>Ratios</h2>
<p>The key to understanding Mendelian genetics is to understand what ratios are and how to determine them. Let&#39;s do a few exercises to insure that you are familiar with ratios.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Ratio order</h2>
<p>In ratios, order means everything. In the example shown above, the F<sub>2</sub> generation had a 3:1 ratio of individuals with purple to white flowers. The same results could be written as a 1:3 ratio of white to purple flowers. Therefore, the order of the traits listed within the ratio are important because the first number in the ratio is related to the first trait listed and the second number in the ratio corresponds to the second trait.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Converting counts to ratios</h2>
<p>Some of Mendel&#39;s actual data are listed below. Note that the ratios are obtained by dividing the larger of the two counts by the smaller.</p>
<table>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td><em>Flower color</em><br />
				Purple = 705 individuals<br />
				White = 224 individuals<b> 705/224 = 3.15<br />
				Ratio of purple:white<br />
				flowers is 3.15:1</b></td>
			<td><em>Pod shape</em><br />
				Inflated = 882 individuals<br />
				Constricted = 299 individuals<br />
				882/299 = 2.95<br />
				Ratio of inflated:constricted<br />
				pods is 2.95:1</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>
<p>An examination of the ratios listed above shows that they are all approximately a 3:1 ratio, some being slightly higher and others slightly lower. The inheritance of traits is governed in some respects by probability (as you will learn in upcoming exercises), therefore, it is sometimes advisable to round off ratios to the nearest whole number.</p>
<p>The relationship between ratios and fractions can be confusing. A ratio of 1:3 means that there are four "units" being considered. In other words, 1:3 does not mean 33% have one trait, while 66% have the other. Rather, 1:3 means that 25% (1 unit) have one trait and 75% (3 units) have the other.</p>
<h2>Estimating Offspring Counts from Ratios</h2>
<h2><object align="right" classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0" data="https://online.science.psu.edu/sites/default/files/biol110/Tutorial3_MendelsCross.swf" height="480" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="640"><param name="quality" value="high" /><param name="movie" value="https://online.science.psu.edu/sites/default/files/biol110/Tutorial3_MendelsCross.swf" /><embed height="480" hspace="10" pluginspage="http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer" quality="high" src="https://online.science.psu.edu/sites/default/files/biol110/Tutorial3_MendelsCross.swf" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" vspace="10" width="640"></embed></object></h2>
<p>Just as you can calculate ratios from counts of offspring, you can also work backwards and estimate offspring counts from ratios. Let&#39;s do an example to demonstrate.</p>
<p>You cross two true-breeding parents, one with purple flowers and one with white flowers, grow and self-pollinate the F<sub>1</sub> generation, and then count the number of offspring with purple and white flowers. If you counted 1,000 offspring and there was a 3:1 ratio of purple:white flowers, how many offspring would have purple flowers? How many would have white flowers?</p>
<p>Pull out a piece of paper and pencil (and/or your calculator) to see if you can get the right answer before viewing the solution below.</p>
<h2>Ratio Problem Solution</h2>
<p><em>n</em> = total number of offspring = 1,000<br />
	3:1 ratio = total of 4 "units" (3 + 1 = 4)<br />
	<sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub> of units have purple flowers, <sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> have white flowers (Recall, there was a 3:1 ratio of purple:white flowers.)<br />
	<sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub> = 75%, <sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> = 25%<br />
	75% purple flowers, 25% white flowers<br />
	Convert to decimal equivalent: 0.75 purple flowers, 0.25 white flowers<br />
	Numbers = <em>n</em> X 0.75 for purple, <em>n</em> X 0.25 for white<br />
	purple = 1,000 X 0.75 = 750, white = 1,000 X 0.25 = 250</p>
<p>Estimate = 750 offspring with purple flowers, 250 with white flowers</p>
<h2>Mendel and the First Principles of Genetics</h2>
<p>Mendel was not the first person to study how features were passed between generations, however, he was the first to take a careful and quantitative look at the situation. In doing so, he made a number of inferences that continue to have a profound influence on how we think about the transmission of information between generations. He didn&#39;t know about DNA, genes, or chromosomes, but his insightful studies laid the groundwork for their discovery.</p>
<p>Mendel quantitatively analyzed how specific traits behaved between generations and concluded that all offspring have two factors for a given character: one was received from the father and one was received from the mother. For a given character (e.g., flower color), one trait was always expressed (i.e., purple was dominant), whereas the other trait might recede between generations (i.e., white was recessive). In other words, recessive traits are only expressed if the two factors are the same (in the <strong>homozygous</strong> state), whereas a dominant trait will be expressed even if only one factor is present (in the <strong>heterozygous</strong> state).</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><object align="left" data="https://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2092734" height="480" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="640"><param name="quality" value="high" /><param name="movie" value="https://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2092734" /><param name="wmode" value="transparent" /><embed height="480" hspace="10" quality="high" src="https://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2092734" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" vspace="10" width="640" wmode="transparent"></embed></object></h2>
<p>Mendel proposed that the discrete units for a given character would segregate away from one another during gamete production (e.g., individuals that were heterozygous with purple flowers could produce gametes with either a white or purple factor, but not both). This is often referred to as the Law of Segregation. Mendel looked at seven different characters and found that each character behaved independent of the other. He concluded that the factors associated with different characters assorted independently (in a random fashion) from one another. This is often referred to as the Law of Independent Assortment.</p>
<p>It has been almost 150 years since Mendel made his observations and inferences. In the years since, geneticists have validated his basic conclusions and we now know they describe the first principles of genetics. While we now refer to "factors" as genes, Mendel was the first to predict their presence and behavior between generations. His basic conclusions are as correct today as they were when he first proposed them, and his work spurred the work of thousands of geneticists.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Modern Mendelian Genetics</h2>
<p>Traits with simple dominant/recessive expression patterns, such as those examined in the previous exercise, are called <strong>Mendelian traits</strong>. Mendelian traits are found in humans, and include attached versus unattached earlobes, mid-digital hair, bent thumbs, and a few other traits. These traits are useful for understanding the basic principles of genetics, but as you will learn in other genetics tutorials, very few traits are actually inherited in this simple manner.</p>

<p>Mankind has been aware of life cycles for thousands of years. Over the millennia, plant breeders have used variations in crop plants to select for improved varieties without really understanding the basic first principles of genetics. They simply crossed individuals that had the most favorable traits. The science of modern genetics is rooted in the work of Gregor Mendel, who was the first to carefully document the behavior of traits between successive generations. Mendel did not know about chromosomes, yet his observations predicted their presence. His careful analyses of monohybrid crosses allowed him to deduce that traits may skip a generation, depending on whether or not they are recessive (i.e., heterozygous recessive alleles are not expressed). In other words, he was able to infer the genetic composition (the genotype) by carefully observing the pattern of the observed character traits (the phenotypes) between successive generations.</p>
<p>We now know that the reason for the particular pattern of phenotypic expression in the F<sub>2</sub> generation is because of the behavior of chromosomes during meiosis in the F<sub>1</sub> generation. Be sure that you understand how the segregation of chromosomes in meiosis provides a mechanism to account for the segregation frequencies observed in the F<sub>2</sub> generation.</p>
<p>Keep in mind, Mendel did his work around the time of the American Civil War.&nbsp; For a vivid historical perspective, imagine Mendel tending his garden in Brno (now in the Czech Republic), while across the Atlantic the armies of the North and South were engaged in a very different activity. Since the work of Mendel, we have learned a good deal about genetics. Not only do we understand why Mendel observed the frequencies that he did in the different generations, the molecular events that relate the genotype directly to the phenotype are also understood.</p>
