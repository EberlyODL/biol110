<h3>Which technique should you choose?</h3>
<p>You are reading a blog written by a student who is working at an archeological dig in Cyprus. She mentions that they just uncovered an ancient burial site in which the skeletal remains of a human are found next to those of a cat. The arrangement of the bones suggests that the cat was buried with its owner and may have been a pet. Remarkably, the location of the grave relative to other known artifacts suggests it is 10,000 years old. If this is correct, then this is the earliest evidence for cat domestication. The blog author suggests that dendrochronological analysis of some of the wood fragments found nearby, together with C<sup>14</sup> analysis should confirm the dates. You are not so sure these two methods will work equally well.</p>
<ul><li>Which method is most likely to shed accurate insight into the age of these two skeletons? Why?</li><li>Which one of these techniques is most reliable?</li></ul>
