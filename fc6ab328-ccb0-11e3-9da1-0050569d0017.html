		<h6>Is this plagiarism or academic dishonesty? Are all three of them at fault? Is Mike more so than Todd? Is Chris obligated to tell the instructor what he saw?</h6>
		<p><strong>Response 1: </strong><em>This is cheating. When completing a group assignment, it is the responsibility of each member to know all of the content, not just the content of their particular piece. Chris might need to talk to the instructor, but first he needs to talk to his friends and try to persuade them to go to the instructor themselves. If that fails, then Chris is obliged to tell the instructor what he knows. </em></p>
		<p><strong>Response 2:</strong> <em>Although the instructor may not say this, you should assume that you are responsible for knowing ALL the content of a group project, not just the part you worked on individually. In a test-taking situation, it is generally safe to assume that no collaboration will be allowed UNLESS the instructor says otherwise. Todd and Chris may want to help their friend Mike, but if Mike were caught, both of them could be implicated and have their grades affected also.</em></p>
		<p><strong>Response 3: </strong><em>This is academic dishonesty. Though several people might work on a project together, they all should take responsibility for understanding the whole project. Communication is important here, so that all participants on the project are well informed during its creation and at its completion. I wouldn&#39;t want these people working for or with me, since I couldn&#39;t trust their accountability for their own work or for the project as a whole. I can imagine if one of them ended up leading a team project out in the workforce they might turn out to be the kind of person who would blame other team members for delays or obstacles, rather than the kind of person who would take responsibility and go the extra mile to get successful project results. I don&#39;t know that Chris is obligated to tell the instructor. It is the instructor&#39;s job to monitor security during a test. It would be a hard decision for Chris--I do know that if it were me in that position I would avoid the others in the future.</em></p>
