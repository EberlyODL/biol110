<h3 id="PlantsI-EvolutionandDiversity,NonvascularPlants-IntroductionandLearningObjectives">Introduction and Learning Objectives</h3>
<p>Plants are a dominant component of terrestrial ecosystems and are the source of energy for the majority of other terrestrial organisms. Modern plants descended from an ancestral plant that lived in an aquatic environment. We will study the evolutionary history of the plant kingdom to better understand the selective forces that have shaped plants' development and led to the diversity of forms in existence today.</p>
<p>First we'll examine the similarities and differences between members of the Kingdom Plantae and the red, brown, and green algae covered in the tutorial "Protists II". Of the three groups of algae, green algae are the closest living relatives to modern land plants. Adaptations for the transition from an aquatic to a terrestrial habitat distinguish members of the plant kingdom, so these features will be discussed in detail. Plants have been evolving for at least 450 million years, and based on their major adaptive features, four major plant lineages (taxonomic groups) are currently recognized. This tutorial will introduce each of these groups. You will also examine the nonvascular plants, the most primitive of the living plants lineages, Throughout the tutorials discussing plant evolution and diversity, a good strategy is to understand the major characteristics of each group, which characteristics are unique to a group, or are found across groups, and how these characteristics reflect adaptations to different environmental conditions. By the end of this tutorial you should have a working understanding of:</p>
<ul><li>The origins of plants and the major factors shaping their evolution</li><li>Plant features that are adaptations to the terrestrial environment</li><li>The major plant lineages and features that are characteristic of each group</li><li>The evolutionary relationships among the nonvascular plants, seedless vascular plants, nonflowering seed plants, and flowering seed plants</li><li>The distinguishing characteristics of nonvascular plants and their life cycles</li><li>The three groups (mosses, liverworts, hornworts) of nonvascular plants</li></ul>
<p>Performance Objectives:</p>
<ul><li>Identify the characteristics of plants</li><li>Describe the benefits and challenges of living in a terrestrial environment</li><li>Summarize the adaptations to terrestrial environments seen in plants</li><li>Explain alternation of generations and the change in the dominant generation as plants evolved</li><li>For each major group, identify the major characteristic(s) of that group and be able to discuss representatives that demonstrate the diversity of the group (this objective also applies to the other Plant tutorials).</li><li>Identify the characteristics of non-vascular plants</li><li>Describe the adaptations in members of this group that allow them to be successful in terrestrial environments</li><li>Summarize the life cycle of a moss, a heterosporous plant, and identify the dominant stage in the life cycle</li></ul>
