<h2>Subcellular Architecture Part 2 VoiceThread Transcript</h2>
<p>Slide 1<br>Cells have an internal support system known as the cytoskeleton.&nbsp; This skeletal system also plays a role in moving substances around the inside of the cell.</p>
<p>Slide 2<br>The smallest cytoskeletal fibers are microfilaments made of contractile protein known as actin.<br>Microfilaments play a critical role in cell motility such as amoeboid movement - the streaming-type movement seen in amoeba and also seen in our white blood cells in our immune system.&nbsp; I have posted a video on ANGEL of a white blood cell engulfing a bacterium - this is possible because of the microfilaments in the cell.</p>
<p>Microfilaments also play an important role in muscle contractions along with a protein known as myosin.<br>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Slide 3<br>Intermediate filaments are somewhat larger than microfilaments, yet smaller than microtubules. Intermediate filaments are made of fibrous proteins wrapped around one another to form a thick, cable-like structure. Intermediate filaments play an important role in supporting cell structures and anchoring organelles in the correct position within the cell.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Slide 4<br>Microtubules are the largest cytoskeletal elements that we will discuss.&nbsp; Microtubules are actually hollow tubes consisting of rows of paired tubulin molecules. Microtubules play a structural role in the cell but they also play an important role in the movement of substances around the cell.&nbsp; For example, microtubules help move the chromosomes during mitosis and meiosis.&nbsp; Microtubules also help move vesicles around the inside of the cell.</p>
<p>You can see this elaborate movement in the "Life of the Cell" video posted on ANGEL.</p>
<p>Slide 5<br>Lysosomes are vesicles that contain digestive or hydrolytic&nbsp; enzymes.&nbsp; These are enzymes that help to break down materials within the cell.&nbsp; The lysosomes play a role in digestion of food particles, destruction of bacteria and viruses in our immune system, and the breakdown of cellular materials to maintain normal concentrations within our cells. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Slide 6<br>When there are problems with subcellular structures - disease can result.&nbsp; A tragic example of this is the genetic disease Tay-sachs.&nbsp; Tay sachs is a recessive genetic condition that results in a nonfunctional lysosomal enzyme being produced.&nbsp; This enzymes normal role is to break down lipids in the brain.&nbsp; In a person with Tay Sachs - this enzyme does not function and the lipids build up in the brain and destroy nerve cell function.&nbsp; There is no cure for this disease and the affected individual dies in childhood.</p>
<p>Slide 7<br>Vacuoles are large membrane bound sacs that play a role in storage of materials within the cell.&nbsp; Plant cells have a very large cenral vacuole - seen here - that stores water to maintain structural support sort of like a water balloon.&nbsp; These vacuoles can also house toxins, pigments, and starches.</p>
<p>Animal cells often do not have vacuoles - but liver cells have vacuoles for the storage of glycogen.</p>
<p>Single-celled protists often have vacuoles for storing and processing food and they typically have contractile vacuoles for pushing water out of their cell.&nbsp; Most single-celled protists live in fresh water - so osmosis is constantly causing water to flow into their cell over the cell membrane.&nbsp; If they did not expel this water - they would explode like an over-filled water ballon.&nbsp; The contractile vacuole pushes excess water out of the cell.</p>
<p>Slide 8<br>This image shows a contractile vacuole in a paramecium.&nbsp; At the top the vacuole is filling with water that is flowing into the cell - a system of canals leadds the water to the vacuole.</p>
<p>When it is full - the vacuole contracts and forces the water back out.</p>
