<p>Many protists, but not all, are single-celled organisms. Like other eukaryotes, most have membrane-bound nuclei and organelles. Protists appear to be relatively simple organisms - only because most are unicellular. However, a closer inspection reveals that they really are surprisingly sophisticated. All of the essential metabolic functions that occur in multicellular organisms (e.g., respiration, photosynthesis, digestion, and excretion) also occur in protists. Many also have sophisticated locomotion. <em>Euglena</em>, found in most freshwater ponds, illustrates this complexity.</p>

<p><em>Euglena</em>&nbsp;possess (within a single cell): a flagellum for locomotion; an eyespot and light detector which, when used in concert, allows them to discern the direction of the most intense light (phototaxis); chloroplasts and mitochondria; a contractile vacuole for osmoregulation; a nucleus; and an extensive endomembrane system.</p>

<p>Protists are a metabolically and ecologically diverse group. Metabolically, they range from photosynthetic autotrophic species to heterotrophic species. They occupy diverse ecological habitats ranging from marine, to freshwater, to terrestrial. They have diverse relationships with other organisms, and are found free-living or as members of various symbioses.</p>
<p>With all of this diversity, protistan taxonomy is uncertain and the field is currently undergoing major changes. Some of these changes are confusing and reflect the uncertainty of how to best classify these organisms.</p>
<p>Some scientists still place all protists together into one kingdom, Protista. Although there are arguments for this classification scheme, in this course we will use a newer system that accommodates the great diversity of protists and recognizes many kingdoms within this group (Figure 5). Scientists working with protists generally agree that these organisms, as a group, are&nbsp;<strong>paraphyletic</strong>. While all eukaryotes arose from a single common ancestor (based on genetic sequence analyses and investigation of cellular components) and are a&nbsp;<strong>monophyletic</strong>&nbsp;group, the group “protists” does not contain all of its descendents because the fungi, plants and animals are recognized as separate kingdoms, making the “protists” paraphyletic.&nbsp; The previous classification of protists into animal-like (Protozoa), plant-like (Protophyta) and fungus-like organisms created many&nbsp;<strong>polyphyetic</strong>&nbsp;groups (members of the groups are descendants of different protist lineages).&nbsp; Because it did not reflect the evolutionary history of the group, that classification system has been discarded but you will see&nbsp; the terms "protozoa" or "protist" used.</p>
<p>For the sake of convenience we will use the term "protist," but keep in mind that this is not a taxonomic term; rather, "protist" describes a diverse group of mostly single-celled eukaryotes.</p>

<p>In this tutorial, you will learn about two of the five kingdoms that have been best characterized: Euglenozoa and Alveolata.&nbsp; You will also learn about the protists with modified mitochondria.&nbsp; In&nbsp;<a href="https://wikispaces.psu.edu/display/bio/Protists+II+-+Kingdoms+Stramenopila%2C+Rhodophyta%2C+Chlorophyta%2C+and+the+Slime+Molds">t</a>he next tutorial, two more kingdoms will be examined: Stramenopila and Chlorophyta. There are&nbsp; protists that do not fit into these kingdoms and we will not discuss them in this course.</p>
