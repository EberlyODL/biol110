<h2>Fungi II Part 1 VoiceThread Transcript</h2>
<p>Slide 1</p>
<p>Phylum Ascomycota are sometimes called the "sac fungi" because they produce a sac-like structure known as an ascus to house their sexual spores.</p>
<p>The ascus is the distinguishing feature of this group.</p>
<p>This a monophyletic group that is the largest most abundant group of fungi - about 75% of all fungi are members of this group.</p>
<p>Some important members of this group include the yeast we use to make beer and bread, the fungi that make up many types of lichen, some important plant parasites, and the organism that gave us the first antibiotic - penicillium.</p>
<p>Slide 2</p>
<p>The distinguishing characteristic of this group is the ascus.&nbsp; An ascus is a sac-like structure that houses eight sexual ascospores.</p>
<p>The ascomycota can also reproduce asexually and produces spores known as conidia but these asexual spores are not produced in an ascus.</p>
<p>The ascus is only produced during sexual reproduction.</p>
<p>Slide 3</p>
<p>The ascomycete sexual life cycle shows karyogamy, plasmogamy, and the formation of the dikaryon.</p>
<p>Two individuals of opposite mating type fuse together during plasmogamy to form the dikaryon - in this group the dikaryon is the ascus.</p>
<p>Within the dikaryon, karyogamy takes place to produce the diploid stage.</p>
<p>The diploid cells undergo meiosis to produce haploid spores.&nbsp; Each spore then goes through mitosis to produce the eight sexual ascospores.&nbsp; These ascospores are then released from the parent fungus to start the new generation.<br>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Slide 4</p>
<p>There are two very important plant diseases caused by ascomycete fungi.</p>
<p>Dutch elm disease is a fungal disease that was first found in the U.S. in 1930.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is spread by the elm beetle and has spread throughout North America and has destroyed more than half of the elm trees.&nbsp;</p>
<p>American chestnut blight is another ascomycete disease that was first found in North America in approximately 1900. &nbsp;</p>
<p>By 1940, 3.5 billion chestnuts had died. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Chestnuts were once a major hardwood component of eastern forests and now they are essentially gone.</p>
<p>Penn State researchers have created a resistant strain and hope to replant forests - if you are interested I have included a link to the Penn State program.<br>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Slide 5</p>
<p>Ascomycete fungi also produce some important mycotoxins - which are toxic substances produced by fungi.</p>
<p>Aflatoxins are toxic substances that can cause diseases in humans and other species.&nbsp; The symptoms of exposure can range from acute symptoms when large amounts of aflatoxins are consumed at once to chronic symptoms such as cancer.</p>
<p>In fact, aflatoxins are the most carcinogenic substances known.&nbsp; Our food supply is screened to make sure that there are not excessive levels of aflatoxins.</p>
<p>Ergot is another toxin produced by fungi that grow on grains and can cause hallucinations.&nbsp; Ergot poisoning was common in Europe prior to modern food processing.&nbsp; In fact, it has been suggested that Ergot poisoning may have helped fuel the French revolution.</p>
<p>A more current concern is Sick House Syndrome<br>from the fungus Stachybotrys that grows on wet cellulose like the cellulose that can be found in dry wall.&nbsp; Improper ventilation lets moisture build up and people can become sick when exposed to the fungal spores.</p>
