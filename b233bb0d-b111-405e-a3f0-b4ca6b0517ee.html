<p>DNA fingerprinting is used in a variety of fields including agriculture, medicine, and historical investigations. It has become particularly useful in forensics, especially in criminal investigations.</p>
<p>A DNA fingerprint is created in a series of steps:</p>
<ol><li>DNA must be isolated - at a crime scene DNA can be isolated from blood, saliva, semen, hair or skin.&nbsp;</li><li>If the amount of DNA that is isolated is small, PCR is used to amplify the isolated DNA (you learned about PCR in the tutorial on DNA Replication).&nbsp;</li><li>The amplified DNA is then cut into pieces using special enzymes known as "restriction enzymes". Restriction enzymes cut DNA at precise sequences (for example, the restriction enzyme EcoR1 cuts DNA at the sequence GAATTC)<em>.</em></li><li>The DNA pieces are then run through a gel (using electricity); the smaller pieces travel further than the larger pieces. This creates a banding pattern that can be seen by fluorescing the DNA bands.&nbsp;</li><li>The pieces of DNA can be treated as alleles. If the frequencies of these alleles in the population are known, it is possible to calculate the probability, using the Hardy-Weinberg equation, that 2 unrelated people have the same set of alleles.</li></ol>
<p>The DNA fingerprints below come from 3 sources â€“ the victim of a violent crime, DNA evidence collected at the crime scene, and the primary suspect in the crime. There are 4 different gene sequences shown. For each gene, if a single band is seen that indicates the individual is homozygous for that particular gene. If two bands are seen, that indicates the individual is heterozygous.</p>
<ul><li>Using the allele frequency information provided in the table below, calculate&nbsp;the probability that the DNA from the crime scene belongs to the suspect.</li></ul>
