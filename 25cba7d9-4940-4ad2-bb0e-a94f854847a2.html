<p>During sexual reproduction in many organisms, such as humans, a sperm fertilizes an egg to produce a zygote. This zygote then begins to divide via mitosis to produce genetically identical daughter cells. Eventually these genetically identical cells will differentiate into different cell and tissue types. &nbsp;This process of cell differentiation is the result of&nbsp;<strong>gene regulation</strong>&nbsp;(gene regulation describes how genes are "turned on" and "turned off"). &nbsp;In each cell type, only certain genes are expressed (in fact, in most human cells only 3-5% of genes are expressed). &nbsp;This control of gene expression is due, in part, to the appropriate binding of transcription factors to the promoter region of a gene. &nbsp;When the transcription factor binds to the promoter, it starts the process of gene expression.</p>

<h2 id="FromGenetoProtein-Mutations">Mutations</h2>
<p>A&nbsp;<strong>mutation</strong>&nbsp;is a change in the nucleotide sequence of a cell. &nbsp;Many of the genetic diseases you learned about in the genetics tutorials are the result of a&nbsp;<strong>point mutation</strong>&nbsp;(a change in a single nucleotide). &nbsp;For example, sickle cell anemia is the result of a single base-pair substitution that replaces a thymine with an adenine. &nbsp;The result is a change in the amino acid sequence of hemoglobin where a glutamic acid (a hydrophilic amino acid) is replaced with a valine (a hydrophobic amino acid).</p>
<p>Additions and deletions of nucleotides can result in mutations known as "<strong>frameshift mutations</strong>" because they throw off the reading frame of the genetic message. &nbsp;Frameshift mutations often result in a completely nonfunctional protein and are thus often significantly more damaging than a point mutation. &nbsp;</p>
