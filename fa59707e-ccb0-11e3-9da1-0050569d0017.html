<p>Now that you have a better idea of how data is gathered, lets look at how is it treated once gathered.</p>
<p>First, let&#39;s introduce the common different types of data that you may have, or will come across.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Binary data - generally Yes/No.</li>
	<li>Categorical data - where individuals are placed into categories e.g. male and female.</li>
	<li>Continuous data - most commonly used where finer measurements are taken e.g. weight, blood pressure, speed etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Binary and categorical data are commonly used in social science and behavioral science, whereas continuous data is commonly used in the life sciences.</p>
<h3>Examples:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Binary - questionnaire - have you ever suffered from a heart condition? (Yes/No); did you graduate from high school? (Yes/No).</li>
	<li>Categorical - smoking status (none, light, heavy); hair color (blond, brown, black, red).</li>
	<li>Continuous - weight gain, size of fish, death rates, carbon emissions per country.</li>
</ul>
