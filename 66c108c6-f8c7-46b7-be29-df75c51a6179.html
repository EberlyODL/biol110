<p><strong>Carbohydrate</strong>&nbsp;biomolecules generally have a basic structural formula that is written as C(H<sub>2</sub>O)n. For example, glucose has the structural formula C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub>. The carbohydrates have many functions in cells. They can be used for energy storage (e.g., starch) and as structural molecules (e.g., cellulose). And as we will see, they also play a role in genetic information storage in <strong>nucleic acids</strong>&nbsp;(organic compounds that make up RNA and DNA).
</p>
<p>The basic monomer of carbohydrates are the simple sugars (<strong>monosaccharides</strong>). Monosaccharides include glucose (also known as dextrose), fructose, ribose, galactose, and ribulose. Note, the -ose suffix is used by chemists to describe all carbohydrates.
</p>
<p>A&nbsp;<strong>disaccharide</strong>&nbsp;is a sugar formed by a condensation reaction between two monosaccharides. Condensation synthesis of maltose (glucose + glucose), a common disaccharide, is illustrated in the following animation. Other disaccharides include sucrose (glucose + fructose) and lactose (glucose + galactose); sucrose is common table sugar, and lactose is milk sugar.&nbsp; Many disaccharides are sweet tasting and are used as a source of energy for cell metabolism.

<p>This animation shows the formation of disaccharides.

<p>More complex forms of carbohydrates can be synthesized by cells via additional condensation reactions.&nbsp;<strong>Polysaccharide</strong>&nbsp;polymers can consist of up to several thousand monomers of simple sugars. The type of polysaccharide is determined by the number, type, and arrangement of its monomers. Starch is a polymer of glucose monomers. It is used by plants to store surplus sugar and when we and other animals eat a starchy plant (such as a potato) we use the starch for energy and nutrients. Animals store surplus sugar in their livers in the form of a molecule known as&nbsp;<strong>glycogen</strong>.

<p>[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=2294|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__right__lightboxed]Cellulose, another polymer of glucose, is an important component of plant cell walls; it is also the most abundant polymer on the planet. Although humans cannot digest cellulose, it is a valuable part of our diet because this "fiber" helps to maintain a healthy digestive tract. Some animals, such as the crab shown here, and fungi use another polysaccharide, chitin, for structural purposes.
