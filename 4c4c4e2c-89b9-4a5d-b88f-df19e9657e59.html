<p>Organisms reproduce in one of two ways: asexually or sexually. In&nbsp;<strong>asexual reproduction</strong>, organisms such as bacteria produce genetically identical offspring or&nbsp;<strong>clones</strong>. The bacterium in the image above is dividing via binary fission - a cloning process.&nbsp; The two bacteria that result from this process will be genetically identical to each other (unless a mutation occurs).</p>
<p>Asexual reproduction is sometimes advantageous to organisms because it is relatively fast, requires less energy, and avoids the potential for creating a bad combination of genes. The major disadvantage of asexual reproduction is that offspring are genetically identical to the parent, and this lack of genetic variation may be detrimental if conditions change and genetic diversity becomes valuable. This situation could occur with the introduction of a new disease or predator, changing environmental conditions, or other factors.</p>
<p>In&nbsp;<strong>sexual reproduction</strong>&nbsp;the genetic material from two parents combines to form offspring that are genetically distinct from their parents (and that are also distinct from other siblings produced by the same parents). Even though sexual reproduction requires more energy and time than asexual reproduction, it provides offspring with a unique genetic makeup that may provide them with a selective advantage in an unpredictable environment. The key to understanding how this genetic variation is maintained lies in examining the behavior of chromosomes during meiosis.</p>
<p>In many of the organisms we will discuss, the exchange (or recombination) of genetic information is obligatorily coupled to reproduction, which is why such an organism is characterized as undergoing sexual reproduction. However, the exchange (or recombination) of genetic information is not always coupled to reproduction. For example, conjugation in bacteria can be accompanied by a brief exchange of genetic material without division; so, bacteria can engage in a form of sex (i.e., exchange of genetic material) known as conjugation and also undergo asexual reproduction (binary fission). Sex and reproduction are not always linked.</p>
