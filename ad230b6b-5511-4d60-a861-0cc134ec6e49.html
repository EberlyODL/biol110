<h2>Chromosome Behavior and Gene Linkage Part 4 VoiceThread Transcript</h2><p>Slide 1<br>Let's work through these problems to help prepare you for the quiz and exam questions you will see.</p><p>This question can best be answered by writing out the genotypes of the parents and then creating a Punnett square.</p><p><br>Slide 2<br>The heterozygous parent can make four different gamete types and the homozygous parent makes one gamete type. &nbsp;If the offspring occur in a 1:1:1:1 ratio - the genes are not linked and they assort independently.</p><p><br>Slide 3<br>If the genes are assorting independently, the genes are not linked and they may or may not be on the same chromosome. &nbsp;Remember for genes to be linked they have to be on the same chromosome AND closer than 50 map units. &nbsp;So unlinked genes can either be on different chromosomes or on the same chromosome but further than 50 map units apart.</p><p>Slide 4<br>To answer this question - you need to write out the genotypes of the parents and think about the way the genes are linked. &nbsp;To be completely linked means that they are so close together on the chromosome they crossing over never recombines them - so they stay together.</p><p><br>Slide 5<br>The original parents are CCdd and ccDD so this means parent 1 has chromosomes with alleles C and d and parent two has chromosomes with alleles c and D. &nbsp;Each parent can only make one gamete type.</p><p>Their offspring will all have the genotype CcDd - but you need to pay attention to the arrangement of alleles - because the genes are completely linked C stays with d and c stays with D - no crossing over occurs. &nbsp;When one of these offspring is crossed with a homozygous recessive individual - there are only two possible offspring that can result - Ccdd or ccDd.</p><p>Slide 6<br>So the answer to this question is B - two.</p><p>Slide 7<br>This question asks you to determine the distance between the genes for bristle structure and body color. &nbsp;The first thing you need to determine is which offspring are the recombinants.</p><p><br>Slide 8<br>Remember, recombinant means the offspring that were created as a result of a crossover between the two genes. &nbsp;By definition, the recombinants are the two smallest categories of offspring and the parentals are the two largest categories of offspring.</p><p><br>Slide 9<br>So the offspring with wildtype bristles, wildtype body and with scute bristles, ebony body are the recombinants. &nbsp;This means that the parental arrangement of alleles is s+ eb and s eb+. &nbsp;Crossing over created the s+ eb+ and s eb gametes.</p><p><br>Slide 10&nbsp;</p><p>So the answer to this question is B - 38 map units. &nbsp;192 + 188 = 380/1000 x 100 = 38% recombination or 38 map units.</p><p>Slide 11<br>This question asks you to determine the percent of gametes the female parent made that have the genotype m eb+. &nbsp;To answer this question - draw out the females chromosomes and subsequent gametes.</p><p>Slide 12<br>You know that the female is heterozygous - but you do not know the specific arrangement of alleles on her chromosomes until you look at her offspring. &nbsp;She can either have both wild-type alleles on one chromosome and both mutants on the other OR she can have one wild-type and one mutant on one chromosome and the other combination of mutant and wild-type on the other chromosome.</p><p>You determine her arrangement by looking at the offspring and determining the parental arrangement. &nbsp;In this example, the Wild type eye color, wild type body color and the mahogany eyes, ebony body are the parental offspring. &nbsp;Therefore, arrangement one is her arrangement of alleles. &nbsp;</p><p>Her gametes that are m eb+ resulted in offspring that have the phenotype mahogany eyes and wild-type body. &nbsp;This category has 176 offspring out of a total of 1000 offspring.</p><p>Slide 13<br>Therefore the answer is A - 17.6%. &nbsp;</p><p><br>If you have questions about any of these practice problems - please let me know.</p>
