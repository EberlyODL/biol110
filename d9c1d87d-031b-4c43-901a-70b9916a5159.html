<h3 id="ChromosomeBehaviorandGeneLinkage-IntroductionandLearningObjectives">Introduction and Learning Objectives</h3><p>Previously we examined the relationship between gene segregation and meiosis. As you should now know, Mendel was able to infer independent assortment between different genes because they were located on different chromosomes (each of which assorts randomly during meiosis). We also mentioned that genes located on the same chromosome may segregate together because they are linked. Next, you will learn why they may, or may not, segregate together. Moreover, you will learn how the frequency at which they become unlinked can be used to construct a genetic map of each chromosome. By the end of this tutorial you should have a basic understanding of:</p><ul><li>Why genes are linked</li><li>How genes become separated by crossing over during prophase I</li><li>The stochastic nature of crossing over</li><li>How crossover frequency can be used to map genes</li><li>How meiotic recombination and independent assortment contribute to generational variation</li></ul><p>Performance Objectives:</p><ul><li>Review the events in meiosis that result in the independent assortment of genes, and the phenomenon of crossing over</li><li>Describe the relationship of the distance between genes on the same chromosome and the frequency of crossing over between the genes</li><li>Calculate the recombination frequency between linked genes based upon the frequency of offspring phenotypes</li><li>Use the recombination frequency between genes to map genes to a chromosome</li><li>Explain how the position of genes on a chromosome can affect the recombination frequency</li><li>Discuss how some genes may be completely linked and not assort independently</li></ul><p></p>
