<h2>Fungi I Part 1 VoiceThread Transcript</h2>
<p>Slide 1</p>
<p>As we continue our survey of earth's biodiversity, our next group of organisms are the members of Kingdom Fungi.</p>
<p>Slide 2</p>
<p>There are six major groups of fungi.</p>
<p>The microsporidians are the newest members of Kingdom Fungi and they are all anmals parasites.&nbsp; We believe this group is monophyletic but as we learn more about them - this may change. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The Chytridiomycota (or "Chytrids") are a group of flagellated fungi - many of which are parasites.&nbsp;&nbsp; We now think this group is paraphyletic and most likely will be reorganized. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The Zygomycota includes common organisms such as bread mold - you know, the stuff that grows on your bread when you leave it on the counter too long.&nbsp;&nbsp; This group is also paraphyletic and will be reorganized.</p>
<p>The remaining three groups are all thought to be monophyletic and include the glomeromycota (an important group of plant symbionts - we will talk more about them later). &nbsp;</p>
<p>Phylum Ascomycota are commonly referred to as the cup or the sac fungi because they have a cup or sac shaped fruiting body. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The Basidiomycota are known as the club fungi because they have club-shaped fruiting bodies.</p>
<p>Just like the plants and animals, the Fungi evolved from a protist ancestor - specifically single-celled protists with flagella.</p>
<p>Slide 3</p>
<p>Fungi live in a variety of habitats and have a variety of modes of obtaining nutrients - but they are all chemoheterotrophs - just like us.</p>
<p>Some fungi are even predatory like this netatode-trapping fungus.&nbsp; Nematodes are smal worm-like creatures that live in the soil and other environments.</p>
<p>Nematode-trapping fungi develop loop traps that they use to trap nematodes as they move through the soil.&nbsp; They then eat these nematodes - but instead of ingesting them the way an animal predator would - they digest the worms alive outside the fungal body and absorb the nutrients back over their cell walls.</p>
<p>Slide 4</p>
<p>Kingdom Fungi contains the largest known organism.</p>
<p>It is a Basidiomycete fungus that measures 3.5 miles across and extends an average of three feet into the ground.&nbsp; It is found in eastern Oregon.</p>
<p>This fungus covers an area as big as 1,665 football fields&nbsp; and is 2400 years old.</p>
<p>It is a parasite on trees and eventually kills the trees it is associated with.</p>
<p>Slide 5</p>
<p>Characteristics of Kingdom Fungi include that they are mainly multicellular (with the exception of the yeasts which are single celled fungi)</p>
<p>They are all heterotrophic (specifically chemoheterotrophs) and can be parasitic, a saprobe, or, as we have just seen, predatory. Saprobes are decomposers - they break down already dead organic material whereas parasites feed on living organic material - that is the distinction between a saprobe and a parasite.</p>
<p>The Fungi are what are described as absorptive heterotrophs.&nbsp; They feed by secreting digestive enzymes into their food and then absorb the nutrients into the cells.&nbsp; This is in contrast to the animals which are ingestive heterotrophs - we have to ingest our food and then digest it.</p>
<p>Fungi have cell walls made of chitin and most of them are nonmotile - meaning they do not have flagellated cells.</p>
<p>Many have a dikaryon state (1N + 1N) -&nbsp; 2 haploid nuclei in same cytoplasmic compartment - the can exist for an extended period of time during the life cycle and it is unique to the fungi.<br>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Slide 6</p>
<p>The bodies of multicellular fungi are made up of structures known as hyphae - slender filaments that have a large surface area for secreting digestive enzymes over and absorbing nutrients.</p>
<p>Some species of fungi can digest cellulose and lignin so they are important recyclers in forest ecosystems.</p>
<p>Unfortunately this ability also makes them problematic if they start growing in your house and digesting your cellulose-based dry wall and the lignin the wood that holds your house together.</p>
<p>Hyphae can be either septate - when there are walls or septa that divide the hypha, or coenocytic if the hypha is not divided.</p>
<p>Slide 7</p>
<p>When we look at a mushroom, for example, we are seeing a mass of hyphae collected together into a structure known as a mycelium.</p>
<p>Slide 8</p>
<p>This image shows some of the diverse fungi that were found on the Penn State campus in the fall.&nbsp; The bright orange fungus in the center of the slide is commonly referred to as a chicken mushroom and, it might seem strange, is delicious when sauteed with butter and garlic.&nbsp; But remember - only hunt for edible mushrooms with an expert.</p>
<p>Slide 9<br>Fungi are involved in some important mutualistic symbiotic relationships.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mycorrhizae are an association between a fungus and plant roots.&nbsp; This relationship is very important in helping plants to survive in the terrestrial environment.&nbsp; The fungus benefits by getting sugars from the plant and the plant benefits by being better able to take up water and nutrients from the environment.</p>
<p>Lichen are a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a photosynthetic partner (a green algae or cyanobacteria)</p>
<p>Just as with the mycorrhizae - the fungus gets fixed carbon (or sugars) and the photosynthetic partner gets minerals and water. So both of these are mutualistic relationships. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Slide 10</p>
<p>Reproduction in the fungi is quite different from other organisms.</p>
<p>For one thing, the fungi are haploid throughout most of their life cycle.</p>
<p>For another, most fungi can reproduce both sexually and asexually and often only reproduce sexually when stressed.</p>
<p>Each of the four main groups of fungi produce distinct features during sexual reproduction and these features are used to classify the fungi.</p>
<p>Slide 10</p>
<p>To understand the fungal life cycle, there are some vocabulary words you need to know.</p>
<p>First, there are no sexes in the fungi because they do not produce gametes.&nbsp; Instead, the fungi are or of mating types, either + or -.&nbsp; The distinct strains are compatible in sexual reproduction and produce a zygote.&nbsp; In other words, only a + and - can reproduce together - two positives can't reproduce and two negatives can't reproduce.</p>
<p>The term Plasmogamy refers to the&nbsp; fusion of cytoplasm of two (or more) cells to form either a dikaryon (if two cells fuse) or a heterokaryon (if more than two cells fuse).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The term karyogamy refers to the fusion of nuclei during sexual reproduction.</p>
<p>Slide 11</p>
<p>During sexual reproduction in the fungi, two haploid mycelia of opposite mating type grow toward each other and during the process of plasmogamy fuse together to produce the dikaryotic stage.&nbsp; The dikaryon is two haploid nuclei in the same cytoplasmic compartment.</p>
<p>The dikaryon then goes through karyogamy - fusion of the nuclei to produce a diploid nucleus.</p>
<p>This starts the diploid stage.&nbsp; The diploid stage is typically very brief and meiosis occurs to produce haploid spores.</p>
<p>These spores are then released from the parent fungus and germinate into new individuals.</p>
<p>As we look at the different groups of fungi - we will see that it is the dikaryon or heterokaryon stage that is unique between the different groups.<br><br>&nbsp;</p>
