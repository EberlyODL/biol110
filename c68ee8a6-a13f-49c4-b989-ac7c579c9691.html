<h2>Plants II Part 2 VoiceThread Transcript</h2><p>Slide 1</p><p>This fern is exhibiting a homosporous life cycle. &nbsp;This fern produces a single spore type that gives rise to a bisexual gametophyte.</p><p>The part of the fern that we think of as the fern - is the sporophyte. &nbsp;On the underside of the leaves are structures known as sporangia that produce the spores via meiosis.</p><p><br>A spore is released from the parent plant when the wind blows, the rain falls, or an animal brushes against it. &nbsp;That spore disperses into the environment and grows into a gametophyte.</p><p>The gametophyte is bisexual - it has both male and female gamete producing structures on the same gametophyte.</p><p>The sperm are flagellated so they must swim to the egg for fertilization to take place. &nbsp;Fertilization produces the diploid zygote which then grows into a new multicellular sporophyte.</p><p>Slide 2</p><p>This image shows the sporangia - the spore producing structures - on the underside of a fern leaf.</p><p>The bottom image is a closeup of a single sporangium with spores forming inside.&nbsp;</p><p>These spores will be released from the sporangium and grow into a gametophyte.</p><p>Slide 3</p><p>The top image shows a gametophyte and the blue circular structures are archegonia - the egg producing structures at 100 times magnification.<br>The gametophyte is independent at this stage - it is not associated with any sporophyte tissue.</p><p><br>The bottom image shows a gametophyte after fertilization has taken place and the sporophyte is growing out of the gametophyte. &nbsp;Eventually the gametophyte will atrophy and wither away and only the sporophyte will remain.</p><p>This remaining sporophyte will produces more spores so the life cycle can continue.&nbsp;</p>
