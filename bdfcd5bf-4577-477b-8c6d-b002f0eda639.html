<p>The life cycle of flowering seed plants is closely tied to their flower and seed structures. In all cases, plants show a pattern of alternation of generations. In addition, all flowering plants show double fertilization, which produces a diploid zygote and triploid endosperm to feed the developing plant embryo. &nbsp;Pollination biology is an important part of the flowering plant life cycle.&nbsp; Pollination can be accomplished by the wind, or by animals pollinators that carry pollen from one flower to another. &nbsp;Plants have evolved a number of different strategies to reduce self-pollination, an extreme form of inbreeding.&nbsp; Seeds protect the developing plant embryo and are found within a fruit. The fruit can help to disperse the seed away from the parent plant to reduce competition.&nbsp; Plants show indeterminate growth and will grow throughout their life time, although the rate of growth will vary at different stages.</p>
