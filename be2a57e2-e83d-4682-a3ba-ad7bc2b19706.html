<p>During fermentation, many microorganisms produce ethanol. The beverage industry exploits this process in the production of beers, wines, and distilled spirits. When humans consume ethanol it is metabolized in the liver.&nbsp; This metabolism of ethanol occurs in three main steps.</p>
<p>In the first step of metabolizing ethanol, alcohol dehydrogenase converts ethanol to acetylaldehyde and a molecule of NADH is produced.&nbsp; In the second step, acetylaldehyde oxidase converts acetylaldehyde to acetate and another molecule of NADH is produced.&nbsp; In the third step, acetyl-CoA synthase produces acetyl CoA from acetate and Coenzyme A. Acetyl CoA then enters the Krebs cycle.</p>
<ul><li>Assuming that the Krebs cycle and the electron transport chain are working efficiently, how many TOTAL molecules of NADH and FADH2 are produced in the catabolism of one molecule of ethanol?</li></ul>
<ul><li>Assuming NADH and FADH2 are converted to ATP at 40% of maximum efficiency in our bodies, how many molecules of ATP are produced from the breakdown of one molecule of ethanol?</li></ul>
