<h2>Prokaryotes II Part 1 VoiceThread Transcript</h2>
<p>Slide 1<br>Within Domain Bacteria, there are two basic types of organisms.&nbsp; Bacteria can be either gram + or gram -.&nbsp; Gram + bacteria are bacteria that absorb a stain known as a gram stain.&nbsp; The gram + bacteria have a relatively thick layer of peptidoglycan (the peptidoglycan is shown in blue) and they do not have an outer membrane.</p>
<p>The gram - bacteria have a relatively thin layer of peptidoglycan and they have a complex outer membrane.&nbsp; They are called gram - because they do not absorb the gram stain.</p>
<p>Slide 2<br>When you are feeling ill and go to the doctor - she may suspect a bacterial infection and perform a bacterial culture.&nbsp; If you have a sore throat for example, she will swab your throat with a cotton swab and grow the bacteria on a petri dish.&nbsp; She will then stain the bacteria to determine if they are gram + or gram - because this distinction will help her determine a course of treatment.</p>
<p>Examples of gram + infections are strep throat, some types of food poisoning, tetanus, and anthrax.&nbsp; As you can see from this picture - the gram + bacteria stain a dark purple from the gram strain.</p>
<p>Slide 3<br>Gram - organisms do not take up the gram stain and instead of being dark purple are pink.&nbsp; E. coli is an example of a gram negative bacterium. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Infections due to gram - bacteria can be difficult to treat because the complex structure of their outer membrane can evade antibiotics and even contain endotoxins that can cause disease.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Slide 4<br>Prokaryotes are capable of movement in their environment and even though they do not have a brain, they can orient themselves in their environments and move toward or away from environmental stimuli.</p>
<p>One way in which bacteria can move is by exceting a slime layer that they can then use to glide across a surface.</p>
<p>Large numbers of bacteria can cooperate with each other and secrete a slime layer known as a biofilm.&nbsp; When you wake up in the morning your teeth probably feel a bit slimy.&nbsp; This is the biofilm that the bacteria in your mouth have produced over night.&nbsp; We brush our teeth to help break up and wash away this biofilm to avoid cavities.</p>
<p>Some bacteria have flagella which are hair-like structures that they can move like a whip to propel themselves through their environment.</p>
<p>This movement is usually in response to an environmental stimulus - for example, some bacteria can respond to light - this is known as phototaxis.&nbsp; Bacteria can respond to gravity (geotaxis) and chemicals in the environment (chemotaxis).</p>
<p>Slide 5<br>Biofilms are common in nature, as bacteria commonly have mechanisms by which they can adhere to surfaces and to each other. As mentioned earlier, dental plaque is a biofilm. In industrial environments, biofilms can develop on the interiors of pipes and lead to clogs and corrosion. In medicine, biofilms spreading along implanted tubes or wires can lead to serious infections in patients. Biofilms on floors and counters can make sanitation difficult in food preparation areas.</p>
<p>Biofilms can also be harnessed for constructive purposes. For example, many sewage treatment plants include a treatment stage in which waste water passes over biofilms grown on filters, which extract and digest harmful organic compounds.&nbsp;</p>
