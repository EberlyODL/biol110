<h3 id="MendelandModernGenetics-IntroductionandLearningObjectives">Introduction and Learning Objectives</h3>
<p>This tutorial emphasizes the work of Gregor Mendel, the father of genetics. Mendel was the first scientist to examine, in a quantitative manner, the behavior of traits between generations. By looking at the proportions of different traits in the offspring of a particular genetic cross, he was able to infer the basic tenets of modern genetics. By the conclusion of this tutorial you should have an&nbsp;understanding of:</p>
<ul><li>Mendel and modern genetics</li><li>The distinction between characters and traits</li><li>Meiosis and the segregation of alleles</li><li>The molecular relationship between an organisms' genotype and phenotype</li><li>Mendel's&nbsp;Laws of Segregation and Independent Assortment</li></ul>
<p>Performance objectives:</p>
<ul><li>Describe the experiments that Mendel did in garden peas to determine the pattern of inheritance for the characters he studied, using correct terminology</li><li>Explain the phenomenon of complete dominance</li><li>Create and use Punnet&nbsp;Squares to make predictions about patterns of inheritance</li><li>Determine possible offspring types and phenotypic ratios resulting from a genetic cross</li><li>Summarize the relationships between meiosis and both of Mendelâ€™s laws (Segregation and Independent Assortment)</li></ul>
