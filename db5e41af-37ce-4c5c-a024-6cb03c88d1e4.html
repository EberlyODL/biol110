<p>There are thousands of different types of biochemical reactions. Although they may involve the joining or breaking down of a myriad of molecules, most use the same basic chemical reaction. Anabolic reactions typically involve the joining of monomers by the removal of a water molecule. In this case a hydroxide (OH) is removed from one molecule and a hydrogen (H) is removed from the adjacent combining molecule. This type of reaction, termed&nbsp;<strong>condensation synthesis</strong>&nbsp;(or&nbsp;<strong>dehydration synthesis</strong>), is illustrated in the animation shown here. Select condensation, and hit play.</p><hydrolysis-condensation></hydrolysis-condensation><p></p>

<p>This animation also depicts a&nbsp;<strong>hydrolysis</strong>&nbsp;reaction (a type of catabolism whereby a polymer is broken down by the addition of water).&nbsp; Hit the "home" icon to return to the beginning; select condensation and hit play.</p>
