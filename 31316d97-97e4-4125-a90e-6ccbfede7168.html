<p>CFTR (Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator) is the gene that causes the genetic&nbsp;condition Cystic Fibrosis (CF). The normal CFTR gene codes for an ion channel protein that regulates the&nbsp;movement of chloride ions across the cell membrane. The most common mutant allele (ΔF508) codes for&nbsp;a defective protein that does not get established in the cell membrane and thus cannot regulate the proper&nbsp;movement of chloride ions. The result is the buildup of a thick mucus layer in the lungs that allows for&nbsp;frequent bacterial infections. Left untreated, CF is a lethal condition. The coding regions of the CFTR gene are over 250,000 base pairs (250 kb) long. The ΔF508 mutation is&nbsp;located approximately 15,000 base pairs into the coding region.</p>
<p>The normal allele has, as part of its sequence along the coding strand (not the template strand), the<br>nucleotides:</p>
<ul><li>5’ AATATCATCTTTGGTGTTTCC 3’</li></ul>
<p>The ΔF508 allele has along the coding strand the corresponding sequence:</p>
<ul><li>5’ AATATCATCGGTGTTTCC 3’</li></ul>
<p>• First, determine the mRNA sequences that are transcribed from both the normal and the ΔF508&nbsp;allele.<br>• Next, use the genetic code below to determine the amino acid sequences that both alleles encode.<br>• What is the specific mutation in the ΔF508 allele?&nbsp;</p>
