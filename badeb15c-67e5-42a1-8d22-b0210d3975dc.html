<h3>Introduction and Learning Objectives</h3>
<p>All living organisms use energy. As you will learn, the basic principles of energy transformations are widely applicable and apply not just to living organisms, but also to other transformations (e.g., the conversion of wind energy to electrical energy by these windmills). The biological molecules that make up living organisms were discussed in the tutorial Carbon and Life. This tutorial will concentrate on how some of these biomolecules are used to provide energy to cells and will provide an overview of the basic rules that govern energy transformations.</p>
<p>By the end of this tutorial you should understand:</p>
<ul><li>What constitutes energy</li><li>The relationship between chemical bonds and energy</li><li>The first and second laws of thermodynamics</li><li>The free energy equation</li><li>The nature of ATP, and how it can be used to perform work</li></ul>
<p>Performance Objectives:</p>
<ul><li>Distinguish between potential and kinetic forms of energy and their importance to organisms</li><li>Describe how energy is stored in chemical bonds</li><li>State the first and second laws of thermodynamics and their importance to biological systems</li><li>Summarize the free energy equation</li><li>Contrast spontaneous and nonspontaneous reactions</li><li>Explain how ATP is used for cellular work</li><li>Discuss the importance of reaction coupling in biological organisms</li></ul>
