<h3>Introduction and Learning Objectives</h3>
<p>This tutorial will cover four protist kingdoms. They have members that are mostly photosynthetic; additionally, many members have a profound influence on humans. We will begin with a discussion of Kingdom Stramenopila, which includes the diatoms, water molds, and brown algae. Next we will examine Kingdom Rhodophyta (the red algae), &nbsp;the Kingdom Chlorophyta (green algae), and will conclude with slime molds, members of the Kingdom Amoebozoa. By the end of this tutorial you should have a fundamental understanding of:</p>
<ul><li>The life histories and classifications of Kingdoms Stramenopila (Phyla Bacillariophyta, Chrysophyta, Oomycota, and Phaeophyta), Rhodophyta &nbsp;Chlorophyta, and Slime molds.</li><li>The organisms that caused the "Great Potato Famine" in Ireland, and the outbreak of downy mildew that nearly destroyed the French wine industry</li><li>The basic characteristics of algae, seaweeds, and kelps</li><li>The relationship between plants and photosynthetic protists</li><li>The relationship of the Amoebozoa to fungi and animals</li></ul>
<p>Performance Objectives (for both tutorials covering the Protists):</p>
<ul><li>Describe the general characteristics of the protists</li><li>Summarize the basic classification of protists</li><li>Explain why Kingdom "Protista" is no longer recognized</li><li>Identify monophyletic, parpaphyletic and polyphyletic groups</li><li>For each taxonomic group of protists, identify the major characteristic(s) of that group and be able to discuss representatives that demonstrate the diversity of the group</li><li>Explain different ways in which protists impact humans, either directly or indirectly</li></ul>
