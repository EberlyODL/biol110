<p>Energy and its relationship with matter were examined in this tutorial. Life exists within the context of the physical rules of the universe. Life does not violate any of these rules; rather, these rules can be used to understand the functioning of life. It is important to understand what energy really is; that which does, or can, move matter. Matter can be things as small as electrons or as large as whales. Most of this tutorial dealt with movement of matter at the chemical level, but these first principles apply to all levels of organization.</p><p>The breakage and formation of chemical bonds at a subatomic level deals with the movement of electrons. Therefore, it is not surprising that these processes involve energetic considerations. Generally, energy is required to break bonds, but energy is released during bond reformation. In a chemical reaction with two reactants, bonds typically must be broken before new bonds form. For example, when methane combines with oxygen, carbon dioxide and water are formed. In this reaction, more energy is released as the bonds reform than was required to break the original bonds. This energy released is available to do work. You will learn that those chemical reactions in the cell that release energy are an important component of energy transduction and are associated with catabolic reactions.</p><p>Some reactions do not release energy. Rather, energy is required in order for these reactions to take place. In fact, anabolic reactions typically require energy (this is why food is required for growth). The chemicals in food are used to supply energy, which are used, in part, to build new biomolecules.</p><p>It is important to recognize the behavior of energy and matter in the universe. These two quantities are described by the laws of thermodynamics. The first law states that energy cannot be created or destroyed; rather, energy is conserved. The second law deals with matter and states that matter is becoming more disordered.</p><p>The two laws of thermodynamics can be related into a quantity known as free energy. The free energy equation is useful because it predicts whether a given reaction will occur spontaneously or non-spontaneously. If the change in free energy is negative, then the reaction will occur spontaneously. If the change in free energy is positive, then the reaction will be non-spontaneous. Virtually all anabolic reactions have an overall positive free energy, but nonetheless occur with the help of energy.</p><p>If a reaction requires energy, where does it come from? It depends on the species. Chemoheterotrophic organisms obtain energy from various high-energy carbon compounds. Photoautotrophic organisms obtain their energy from the sun. Ultimately most chemoheterotrophs depend on photoautotrophs for food, so most life on the planet depends on the sun as an energy source.</p>
