<h2>DNA Replication Part 1 VoiceThread Transcript</h2><p>Slide 1<br>DNA replication is the process of replicating a chromosome - this occurs prior to cell division and is the process that creates the sister chromatids.</p><p>Slide 2<br>Recall from our discussions of mitosis and meiosis that before a cell divides it must make a copy of each chromosome. &nbsp;In the image on this slide we see on the left the unreplicated chromosome and on the right the replicated chromosome comprised of two identical sister chromatids. &nbsp;DNA replication is the process that creates the identical sister chromatids.</p><p><br>Slide 3<br>In order to understand the process of DNA replication, we must understand the structure of the DNA molecule. &nbsp;As mentioned in the previous tutorial, a DNA molecule is double stranded molecule that is held togther by hydrogen bonds between nitrogenous bases of the two strands.</p><p><br>Slide 4<br>The hydrogen bonds between the two nitrogenous bases are specific and only form between an adenine and thymine and a guanine and cytosine - these are the DNA base pairing rules.</p><p>There is another rule to the way the two DNA strands pair. &nbsp;Each strand of DNA has a 5' end and a 3' end. &nbsp;The 5' and 3' refer to the numbering of the carbons in the sugar molecule of the nucleotides. &nbsp;The top nucleotide on the left of this image shows the numbering of the carbons. &nbsp;On the strand on the left, the 5' carbon is oriented toward the 5' end of the molecule. &nbsp;The 3' end of the molecule is oriented toward the 3' sugar. &nbsp;The strand on the right has the opposite orientation - the 3' end is toward the top of the molecule and the 5' end is toward the bottom. &nbsp;Whenever nucleic acids base pair together - the 3' end of one strand must be aligned with the 5' end of the other. &nbsp;This rule will be very important when we discuss both DNA replication and protein synthesis.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Slide 5<br>The process of DNA replication takes place within the nucleus (the DNA in our cells is mainly in the nucleus). &nbsp;In order for a cell to build a new molecule of DNA it needs some raw materials. &nbsp;</p><p>First, there needs to be a template or original molecule of DNA. &nbsp;During DNA replication, both strands of DNA are copied.</p><p>There also needs to be a supply of nucleotides to build the new DNA.</p><p>Finally, there needs to be enzymes to actually do the job of building the molecule. &nbsp;Enzymes are proteins that perform jobs within cells. &nbsp;The enzymes that do the job of replicating DNA are helicase, primase, DNA polymerase, and Ligase. &nbsp;We can tell by the names that these are all enzymes because they all end in the suffix "ase". &nbsp;Most enzymes are named this way.</p><p>DNA polymerase is the enzyme that actually builds the DNA polymer. &nbsp;It has one very important limitation - it can only add nucleotides to the 3' end of the newly synthesized DNA strand. &nbsp;We will see why this is important shortly.</p><p>Slide 6<br>This image shows most of the details about DNA replication. &nbsp;Note that this image shows the overall direction of replication - this means that parental DNA molecule is unwinding from right to left. &nbsp;</p><p>Before the DNA can be replicated - the two strands must unwind and separate from each other. &nbsp;It is the job of helicase to unwind the parental strands and proteins known as single-strand binding proteins anchor the two strands so they cannot reattach to each other.</p><p>Slide 7<br>To begin replication, the process must be primed. &nbsp;This means that an existing piece of nucleic acid must be placed along the original DNA to start the process of replication. &nbsp;The enzyme primase is responsible for priming the process. &nbsp;It places a small RNA primer along the original DNA. &nbsp;Each strand is being copies so each strand requires primers. &nbsp;</p><p>The reason the process requires a primer is because DNA polymerase cannot start producing new DNA from scratch. &nbsp;DNA polymerase can only add to an existing piece of nucleic acid.</p><p><br>Slide 8<br>DNA polymerase adds nucleotides to the 3' end of the newly placed primer and continues to add nucleotides until the entire molecule has been replicated. &nbsp;Each strand is replicated so DNA polymerase is working along each strand. &nbsp;Because the two DNA strands are antiparallel DNA polymerase cannot add continously along both strands. &nbsp;Along the top strand - referred to as the leading strand, the newly synthesized DNA is oriented in the 5' to 3' direction. &nbsp;So DNA polymerase can happily go along adding nucleotides in the direction of replication in a continous fashion.</p><p>Along the bottom strand - known as the lagging strand, DNA polymerase has to work opposite to the overall direction of replication. &nbsp;This is because DNA polymerase can only add nucleotides to the 3' end of the new DNA. &nbsp;The result is that along the lagging strand DNA gets produced in discontinous fragments known as Okazaki fragments. &nbsp;Each fragment requires its own primer so primase has to work multiple times along the lagging strand.</p><p><br>Slide 9<br>The final enzyme to work is ligase. &nbsp;Its job is to connect the Okazaki fragments together into one seamless piece of DNA. &nbsp;First the RNA primers are removed and then the fragments are sealed together. &nbsp;The result is that at the end of DNA replication - an entire chromosome has been copied to create an identical sister chromatid.</p><p><br>Slide 10&nbsp;<br>The next three slides are practice problems. &nbsp;Work them through and then access the next Voice Thread to see the solutions.</p>
