<p><strong>Lipids</strong>&nbsp;are an assortment of molecules so diverse that it may seem odd to group them together. However, they do share one common trait; they are all (to some extent) hydrophobic. Also, in contrast to the other groups of macromolecules, the lipids are&nbsp;<strong>not</strong>&nbsp;polymers. The lipids main biological functions include energy storage (e.g., fats), the main structural components of cell membranes (e.g., phospholipids and cholesterol), and hormones and other cell signaling molecules (e.g., estrogen and testosterone). The lipids include dietary fats (also known as&nbsp;<strong>triacylglycerols</strong>),&nbsp;<strong>phospholipids&nbsp;</strong>(which are an important component of cell membranes), and&nbsp;<strong>steroids</strong>&nbsp;(e.g., cholesterol, estrogen and testosterone).</p>
<p>Fats and oils are triacylglycerols, which are formed when three fatty acid molecules and one glycerol molecule join via condensation synthesis. This animation depicts the synthesis of a triacylglycerol molecule. The following animation shows synthesis of a fat.</p>

<p>Fats can be saturated or unsaturated.&nbsp;<strong>Saturated fats</strong>&nbsp;do not have double bonds in their hydrocarbon chains and each carbon is bound to two other carbons and two hydrogens.<strong>Unsaturated fats</strong>&nbsp;have double bonds along their lengths (monounsaturated = one double bond, polyunsaturated = more than one double bond). Saturated fats have straight chains that organize into more tightly packed arrangements. In contrast, unsaturated fats have kinks caused by the double bonds, which do not permit tight packing. Thus, saturated fats tend to be solids at room temperature, whereas unsaturated fats are usually liquid. A liquid unsaturated fat can be converted to a solid saturated fat by a process called hydrogenation (e.g., margarine).</p>
<p>Fats are used in energy storage, protection, and insulation. Aquatic and polar mammals counteract heat loss by having extra fat for insulation. Compare the Arctic polar bear and subtropical gazelle. Clearly, they don't have a similar need for extra insulation.</p>
<p>In contrast to the fats,&nbsp;<strong>phospholipids</strong>&nbsp;are amphipathic molecules that have only two fatty acids molecules, and a glycerol joined to a phosphate group. This figure depicts this arrangement of two hydrophobic "tails" attached to a hydrophilic "head" (the phosphate group is charged, allowing it to dissolve in water). This unique structure forms the basis for the phospholipid bilayer of cell membranes.</p>

<p style="clear: left;">Another group of lipids, the&nbsp;<strong>steroids</strong>, is characterized by a four-fused ring structure. The steroids include cholesterol, and some hormones (e.g., estrogen and testosterone) produced from cholesterol. Cholesterol is an important component of cell membranes and the vertebrate animal sex hormones estrogen and testosterone are synthesized from cholesterol. &nbsp;</p>
