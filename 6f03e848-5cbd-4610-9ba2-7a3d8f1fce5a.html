<h2>Mendel and Modern Genetics Part 3 VoiceThread Transcript</h2>
<p>Slide 1<br>The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster has 3 pairs of autosomal chromosomes and an X and Y chromosome (males are XY, females are XX).&nbsp; How many different chromosome combinations are produced by independent assortment in D. melanogaster?&nbsp;</p>
<p>The answer is 16 different chromosome combinations.<br>2^4 = 16<br>In this example, there are 4 homologous pairs of chromosomes (the X and Y are not truly homologous but they behave like homologs during meiosis)</p>
<p>Slide 2<br>An individual has genotype AaBbCC.&nbsp; How many different gamete types can this individual make with respect to these genes?</p>
<p>The answer is 4.&nbsp; There are two heterozygous genes - gene A and gene B.&nbsp; Gene C is homozygous and does not result in any genetic variation.</p>
<p>2^2 = 4, where 2 = # of heterozygous genes</p>
<p>Slide 3<br>An individual has genotype AaBbCc. How many different gamete types can this individual make with respect to these genes?</p>
<p>The answer is 8.&nbsp; In this example, all 3 genes are heterozygous. &nbsp;</p>
<p>2^3 = 8, where 3 = # of heterozygous genes</p>
