<p>Although there are now more than 100,000 described species of fungi, mycologists (scientists who study fungi) estimate that there are probably more than 1.5 million species. The kingdom is comprised of six major groups:</p>
<ul><li>Microsporidians</li><li>Chytridiomycota</li><li>Zygomycota</li><li>Glomeromycota</li><li>Ascomycota</li><li>Basidiomycota</li></ul>

<p>The categorization of fungi is based on molecular data from DNA sequences and life cycle features. In some cases, a complete sexual life cycle has not been observed and some mycologists use a fifth phylum (Imperfecta or Deuteromycota) as a repository for these species, but with the information now available from molecular data this category is rarely used.</p>
<p>Although originally grouped with plants, modern molecular systematists now think the lineage that gave rise to modern fungi arose before plants; the molecular data suggest that this occurred just over one billion years ago. &nbsp;The amoeboid protists are the sister group to fungi and animals.</p>
<p>All fungi are heterotrophic, and many are important and prolific decomposers, recycling organic carbon trapped mostly in plant cell walls as lignin and cellulose. A major distinguishing feature of the kingdom is&nbsp;<strong>absorptive nutrition</strong>. Food sources are digested externally, then absorbed into their cells. They produce large amounts of organic acids to acidify their local environment, followed by powerful digestive enzymes to break down their food source. Fungi are almost unlimited in what they can digest. Everything from trees to human skin (e.g., athlete's foot, ringworm) are subject to fungal decay.Fungi are also distinguished by their filamentous vegetative structures,&nbsp;<strong>hyphae</strong>&nbsp;(hypha, sing.; somewhat different structurally from the hyphae of the oomycetes discussed in the Protist II tutorial), and the presence of chitin as a primary cell wall polymer. A group or mass of hyphae (<strong>mycelium</strong>) may be visible to the naked eye as a white or gray fuzz on moldy bread or on a decaying tree.</p>

<p>Extensive networks of mycelia&nbsp;give fungi a tremendous amount of surface area in a small space, making them ideally adapted to their absorptive mode of nutrition. Cellular specialization is somewhat limited in the kingdom. Hyphae can be characterized as having cells divided by structures called&nbsp;septa&nbsp;(septate hyphae), or the absence of septa (coenocytic hyphae). How is this body structure an adaptation to absorptive feeding?</p>
<p>Many fungal plant parasites invade host tissue with specialized structures (haustoria) that are used to absorb the cellular contents of their hosts. These fungi can either decrease the fitness of the host or cause death to the host.</p>
