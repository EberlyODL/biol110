<p>Imagine that you are a forensics investigator and you have been called to a crime scene to look for any potential evidence a criminal may have left behind. &nbsp;You carefully analyze the scene of the crime and find a single drop of blood on the windowsill where the culprit cut himself while breaking the window.</p>
<p>What can you do with this single drop of blood?&nbsp; If you have enough DNA, you can create a DNA fingerprint that may allow you to identify the person responsible for the crime.&nbsp; But a single drop of blood does not contain enough DNA to create a fingerprint.&nbsp; What can you do?</p>
<p>The answer is to use PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) to amplify (or make many copies of) the DNA.&nbsp;</p>
<p>PCR is a laboratory technique that uses the basic steps and materials of DNA replication to create a large number of copies of a small piece&nbsp;of DNA in a short period of time (PCR cannot be used to copy entire chromosomes).&nbsp; Invented in 1983 by Kerry Mullis (who won the Nobel Prize for his invention in 1993), PCR has revolutionized the study of biology and its applications.&nbsp;</p>
<p>PCR involves using a machine called a thermocycler to repeatedly heat and copy a segment of DNA.&nbsp; Added to the thermocycler are the template DNA, specific DNA primers, DNA polymerase, and DNA nucleotides (along with some other chemicals that help the reactions run).</p>

<p>The basic steps of PCR are:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; <u>Denaturation</u>:&nbsp; the DNA is heated to separate the two complimentary strands (note that in a cell helicase would play this role).</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; <u>Annealing</u>:&nbsp; the temperature is lowered and the DNA primers attach (or anneal) to the regions around the segment of DNA to be copied.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; <u>Elongation</u>:&nbsp; DNA polymerase copies the template segment of DNA.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; <u>Repeat the process:</u>&nbsp; The process is repeated until the desired amount of DNA is obtained.&nbsp; In a few hours, millions of copies of a piece of DNA can be created.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The earliest generations of this technology were relatively slow and labor intensive because the denaturation stage would destroy the DNA polymerase (DNA polymerase, like all proteins, is heat sensitive).&nbsp; &nbsp;A technician would need to add new DNA polymerase after each heating cycle.&nbsp; However, in 1976 biologists had discovered a heat resistant DNA polymerase from a bacterium that lives in hot springs (<em>Thermus aquaticus</em>).&nbsp; This DNA polymerase is now referred to as <em>Taq</em> polymerase and its use in PCR has made the process faster and less labor intensive because the <em>Taq</em> polymerase survives the heating cycles.</p>
<p>Yet another example of biodiversity playing an important role in improving human lives!</p>
