<p>Prokaryotes are everywhere. They have been found at the deepest depths of the oceans and high above in the atmosphere. Based on sheer numbers and species diversity, they are the most successful group of life on the planet. A group of studies published in Summer 2012 showed that each human has their own “microbiome” with as many as a thousand different strains of bacteria. Prokaryotes are an essential component of Earth’s ecology, and many human diseases are caused by bacteria, so understanding their biology is important in many different fields.</p>
<p>This tutorial is the first in a three-part series discussing prokaryotes. By the end of this first tutorial you should have a basic understanding of:</p>
<ul><li>The basic features of all prokaryotes</li><li>The diverse lifestyles of prokaryotes</li><li>Why prokaryotes can undergo rapid evolutionary change</li><li>The basic genetic organization of prokaryotes</li><li>How prokaryotes can acquire new genetic information through asexual reproduction</li></ul>
<p>Performance objectives:</p>
<ul><li>Summarize the major differences between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells</li><li>Describe the two domains within prokaryotes, including their relationship to eukaryotes</li><li>Describe the differences between the archaea and the bacteria</li><li>Explain how prokaryotes reproduce and exchange genetic information</li><li>Discuss the evolutionary consequences of a short generation time</li></ul>
