    <title>Life and Natural Selection</title>
    <body>&lt;h3&gt;What is Life?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;Biology is the study of life. But, what is life? We all recognize it, but defining it can be a challenge and there is no single correct definition. Some of the usual definitions that you may have encountered in the past may be unsatisfactory. For example, a common definition is, &quot;the ability to self-replicate.&quot; This works most of the time, but what about viruses? They don&amp;#39;t replicate (on their own), but they behave in many other ways as living entities. One definition that is particularly satisfying deals with how life behaves over successive generations. That is, life is not static; rather, it changes with time. In this course we will define life as &quot;that which undergoes, or is subject to, natural selection.&quot; This definition sounds simple, but as you will learn, it involves complex interactions.&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Natural Selection and Evolution&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;The title of this course is Concepts of Biology and Biodiversity. Evolution is an important process in biology, and it explains the diversity of life that exists in our world. We now know that all life is related and can be traced back to a common ancestor that existed some 3.5 billion years ago. In the vast time since life first appeared, evolution has resulted in a continuous branching of new species that can be described as a tree of life. Rooted firmly at the bottom is life&amp;#39;s common ancestor, whereas modern species reside at the tree&amp;#39;s tips; the vast branching that exists between the two describes the history of life on the planet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;In this class, evolution will be a reoccurring theme. Whenever appropriate, we will discuss how evolutionary processes have shaped life&amp;#39;s intricacies. As you will learn, evolution has many facets that have contributed to the diversity of life. However, only one process adapts life to the environment; namely, natural selection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What is Natural Selection?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;Natural selection is a process by which a population becomes adapted to an environment over time. At the most fundamental level, natural selection results in changes in the frequency of certain genes and/or alleles over successive generations within a population. As you might gather, genetics plays an important role in understanding natural selection; therefore, this course will begin by discussing the basic tenets of genetics. In the next few tutorials you will learn how heritable traits are passed between generations and how these traits behave in a population.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Introduction and Goals:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;This tutorial addresses the concept of evolution on a broad scale by looking at biological diversity in the context of a changing planet. As you will learn, Earth&amp;#39;s environment has had a varied past. By the end of this tutorial you should have a basic understanding of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The age of the universe, the solar system, and life&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The dynamic structure of Earth&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The distinction between relative and absolute dating methods&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The basic principles behind radiometric dating, dendrochronology, and racemization.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How Old is the Earth?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;The available astronomical data indicate that the universe is about 13.7 billion years old. This estimate is based, in part, on the observation that the universe is constantly expanding. Astronomers have plotted the trajectories (directional movement) of various stars and galaxies and determined that all matter in the known universe arose from a common point. In an event often referred to as the &quot;Big Bang,&quot; the universe arose in a relatively brief moment in time and matter was flung outward from this central origin. Matter has been hurling through space, undergoing a number of changes as it traverses the cosmos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;Since the beginning, this vast amount of matter has been undergoing constant change. By using radiometric dating techniques (discussed in this reading) of pristine meteorites, astronomers have determined that our own solar system formed 4.55 - 4.56 billion years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;The Hubble telescope was dispatched in 1990 to explore the far reaches of our galaxy and to photograph events (e.g., star formation). Astronomers use images captured by the Hubble telescope to further understand the origin of the universe and solar systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Early Earth&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class="content" style="text-align: justify;"&gt;Our own limited lifespan could lead us to believe that Earth is a stable structure, however, geological data indicate that Earth has changed radically since its birth. In fact, Earth&amp;#39;s surface is dynamic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Tutorial 14. Figure 2. Continental Drift Pangaea" src="assets/tutorial14_figure2continentaldriftpangaea.jpg" style="height: 135px; width: 300px;" title="Tutorial 14. Figure 2. Continental Drift Pangaea" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earth&amp;#39;s crust consists of large plates that move with respect to each other (as depicted here).&amp;nbsp;This movement, termed&lt;strong&gt; plate tectonics&lt;/strong&gt;, is due to spreading centers and subduction zones. As a result of this crust movement, the continents are constantly rearranging themselves in a phenomenon known as &lt;strong&gt;continental drift&lt;/strong&gt;.When two plates intersect, any number of geological events (e.g., mountain building, volcanic eruptions, and earthquakes) can result. Continental drift can be measured by a variety of techniques, and geologists have discovered that different land masses drift at different rates. The slowest rates of movement are about 2.5 cm/year, whereas the fastest are around 15 cm/year. Given the vast amount of water on the planet, this redistribution of land also influences ocean partitioning and water levels. (Climatic changes also influence water distributions.) In the last 4.5 billion years, many changes in landmasses have occurred on the planet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 1. Continental Drift Plate Tectonics" src="assets/tutorial14_figure1continentaldriftplatetectonics.jpg" style="height: 269px; width: 250px;" title="Figure 1. Continental Drift Plate Tectonics" /&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:;"&gt;About 250 million years ago, all of the landmasses were joined as a supercontinent that geologists named &lt;strong&gt;Pangaea&lt;/strong&gt;. About 180 million years ago, Pangaea began to break apart into the Northern Laurasia and Southern Gondwana landmasses, which eventually separated to create the landmasses that exist today. The history of a supercontinent explains many of the similarities observed in modern animals on separate landmasses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;How Do We Know What We Know?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The fossil record:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Tutorial 14, figure 3.  Sedimentary Rock and Fossil Formation" src="assets/tutorial14_figure3sedimentaryrockandfossilformation.jpg" style="height: 182px; width: 300px;" title="Tutorial 14, figure 3.  Sedimentary Rock and Fossil Formation" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;This figure summarizes the major events associated with the formation of sedimentary rock. Note that each stratum, or layer, represents a particular period in Earth&amp;#39;s history and is characterized by a collection of fossils of organisms that lived at that time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best evidence about the origin of life and evolution of living organisms comes from the fossil record. &lt;strong&gt;Fossils&lt;/strong&gt; can be preserved remnants of organisms (e.g., bones and teeth) or whole organisms embedded in amber, acid bogs and tar pits, or anywhere bacteria can&amp;#39;t decompose a dead body. Fossils can also be found in other forms (e.g., an animal&amp;#39;s footprint). A scientist who studies fossils is a paleontologist.&lt;img border="0" height="0" src="http://c.gigcount.com/wildfire/IMP/CXNID=2000002.0NXC/bT*xJmx*PTEzMDY1MTI2MzY5NzgmcHQ9MTMwNjUxMjc*ODMwMiZwPTIwNjQyMSZkPWIyMDU*MDUxJmc9MiZvPTk2NjhhNGRlZDA4/NDRmNzlhYTY1ZTI4N2RlOTA2Y2E4Jm9mPTA=.gif" style="visibility: hidden; width: 0px; height: 0px;" width="0" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Relative Dating&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;Probably the best source of fossils is &lt;strong&gt;sedimentary rock&lt;/strong&gt;,which is formed by layers of minerals that settle in water. Over time these minerals build up and pack the layers lying beneath them, along with any organisms that have settled with the sediments. The location of fossils in sedimentary rock is indicative of their relative age. This means that one fossil can be classified as older than another based on their relative position in the sedimentary rock. Deeper layers were formed earlier and their fossils are older than those found in more shallow layers of rock. This method of estimating the relative age of a fossil is known as relative dating. Fossils are divided into age groups according to a geological time scale, whereby explosions of life or mass extinctions mark the general age of Earth. For example, layers of rock bearing evidence of the origin of most modern animal phyla would be classified as belonging to the Cambrian period in the Paleozoic era.&amp;nbsp; Layers of rock bearing fossils suggest a rapid diversification of reptiles that belong to the Permian period in the Paleozoic era.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;img alt="Tutorial 14 Figure 5. Mesozoic and Cenozoic Eras" src="assets/Tutorial14_Figure5MesozoicandCenozoicEras.jpg" style="height: 178px; width: 300px;" title="Tutorial 14 Figure 5. Mesozoic and Cenozoic Eras" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Absolute Dating&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;A variety of methods are used to estimate a fossil&amp;#39;s age in years, rather than simply in relative terms. These absolute dating methods include radiometric dating, dendrochronology and racemization. These methods will be explored below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Radiometric Dating&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;The identity of a particular atom is determined by the number of protons it has in its nucleus. However, a collection of atoms of a particular element can have varying numbers of neutrons. For example, hydrogen atoms can have no neutrons (the most common form, sometimes called protium), one neutron (deuterium) or two neutrons (tritium). These are hydrogen&amp;#39;s three &lt;strong&gt;isotopes&lt;/strong&gt;. Moreover, different isotopes have different (but predictable) stabilities. Many elements have radioactive isotopes; their nuclei decay at predictable rates (unique for each isotope) and give off energy and atomic particles. When the decay leads to a change in the number of protons, it transforms the atom to an atom of a different element. For example, potassium-40 decays from a radioactive parent atom to a stable daughter atom of argon-40. Scientists have identified several elements with radioactive isotopes that decay at known rates; they can be used to date various rocks, including those containing fossils. This procedure is known as &lt;strong&gt;radiometric dating&lt;/strong&gt;, and as mentioned earlier, this absolute dating method has been used to date material as old as meteorites. Let&amp;#39;s take a closer look at how this method works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Tutorial 14. Figure 6. Radiometirc Dating" src="assets/Tutorial14_Figure6RadiometircDating.jpg" style="height: 210px; width: 300px;" title="Tutorial 14. Figure 6. Radiometirc Dating" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;This illustration describes how, over time, radioactive parent atoms decay and the number of stable daughter atoms, relative to the number of parent atoms, increases exponentially. Note how the two lines intersect at the first &lt;strong&gt;half-life&lt;/strong&gt; point. In other words, a radioisotope&amp;#39;s half-life is the amount of time it takes for one-half of the parental atom population to decay into daughter atoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;It takes 1.25 billion years for half of the potassium-40 in a sample to decay to argon-40; in other words, the half-life of potassium-40 is 1.25 billion years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;Because living things contain so much carbon, radiometric dating using carbon-14 (C14), also called &lt;strong&gt;radiocarbon dating&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;carbon-14 dating&lt;/strong&gt;, is quite common.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How Do We Know That C-14 Dating is Accurate?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;When a living organism dies, it stops absorbing C14 and the C14 that is already in the organism begins to decay. C14 decays at a slow, steady rate and reverts to N14. The rate at which carbon decays (its half-life) is typically between 5600 and 5700 years. After about 50,000 years, the amount of C14 remaining is so small that material can&amp;#39;t be dated reliably.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;How do we know this is accurate? In order to have confidence in a scientific fact, corroboration is required. In other words, without an independent means of verifying a fact, its scientific value is questionable. The more a fact is checked using different methods, the more reliable the scientific community judges that fact. Many experiments have verified the usefulness and accuracy of carbon-14 dating. For example, archaeologists know from the historical record the age of various Egyptian tombs. Wood taken from these tombs has been dated using the carbon-14 dating method, and the two dates are the same. In addition, the argon/potassium-40 dating method has been used to date Mount Vesuvius&amp;#39;s eruption in Italy, and this date coincides with the date reported by Roman historians. Many other corroborative dates have validated the use of radiometric methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 style="text-align: justify;"&gt;Dendrochronology&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dendrochronology&lt;/strong&gt; is an absolute dating technique. This science relies on the fact that tree growth occurs in spurts, depending on seasonal variations in water and sunlight. Trees have annual growth rings that reflect their ages, and that often reveal something about past climate conditions. Remarkably, global fluctuations of weather patterns appear to be the best indicators of annual growth ring changes; wood obtained from Egyptian tombs has been matched to tree growth ring patterns found in ancient trees located in California. This figure depicts the basic strategy used to date a piece of wood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;object align="" data="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2067837" height="480" width="640"&gt;&lt;param name="quality" value="high" /&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2067837" /&gt;&lt;param name="wmode" value="transparent" /&gt;&lt;embed height="480" quality="high" src="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2067837" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="640" wmode="transparent"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;Dendrochronology and radiometric dating have been used to date many bristlecone pine trees in the White Mountains of California. The oldest tree has been named Methuselah, and dendrochronology and carbon-14 dating methods have determined the tree to be 4,767 years old. Moreover, by matching tree growth ring patterns with dead wood laying in the vicinity, a tree growth ring catalog has been created that spans back 9,000 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Tutorial 14. Figure 7. Dendrochronology" src="assets/Tutorial14_Figure7Dendrochronology.jpg" style="height: 171px; width: 300px;" title="Tutorial 14. Figure 7. Dendrochronology" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Amino Acid Racemization&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;Amino acids (subunits of proteins; to be discussed in tutorial 16) exist in two &lt;strong&gt;isomer&lt;/strong&gt; forms: a left-handed (L-form) isomer and a right-handed (D-form) isomer. During protein synthesis, organisms only use the L-form amino acids; however, when an individual dies, its L-form amino acids are slowly converted to D-form amino acids. This chemical conversion is termed &lt;strong&gt;racemization&lt;/strong&gt;, and knowing the rate of racemization for a given amino acid allows scientists to date some fossils. While this absolute dating technique has its uses, it is constrained by the fact that racemization is temperature-sensitive. Therefore, this method can only be used if the climate has remained relatively stable. It also cannot be used on fossils that have mineralized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;object align="" height="480" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="640"&gt;&lt;param name="quality" value="high" /&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2068185" /&gt;&lt;param name="wmode" value="transparent" /&gt;&lt;embed height="480" hspace="10" quality="high" src="http://voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2068185" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" vspace="10" width="640" wmode="transparent"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;This tutorial explored the age of Earth and some techniques for investigating Earth&amp;#39;s past. What do we know about events that occurred in Earth&amp;#39;s distant past? To answer this question, biology has turned to the sciences of geology, physics, and astronomy to learn about the conditions that existed in Earth&amp;#39;s distant past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;The available astronomical data indicate that the universe is about 15 billion years old. This estimate is based, in part, on the observation that the universe is constantly expanding. Astronomers have plotted the trajectories of various stars and galaxies and determined that all matter in the known universe arose from a common point. In an event, often referred to as the &quot;Big Bang,&quot; the universe arose in a relatively brief moment in time and matter was flung outward from the central origins. Matter has been hurling through space and undergoing a number of changes as it traverses the cosmos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;Our solar system formed about 4.5 billion years ago. It appears that Earth began forming shortly thereafter, and evidence suggests that life first appeared about 1 billion years later. The available evidence indicates that evolutionary events have been ongoing over the last 3.5 billion years and that these processes have led to the diversity of life we see around us today. In thinking about evolution, remember that all extant species represent &quot;modern&quot; forms of life. The challenge that faces evolutionary biologists is to reconstruct events that have occurred in Earth&amp;#39;s distant past, and to infer the nature of ancient events that have contributed to the diversity of organisms that we see today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;One of the first challenges is to know the temporal sequences of historical events. Fortunately, geologic events provide valuable information. The Earth&amp;#39;s crust is not a static structure. It changes as a result of plate tectonics (which leads to continental drift, which is measured at about 1 inch/year), as well as changes in the water levels of the oceans (due to redistributions during one of several ice ages), wind, the successive layering of sediments (material in the oceans sink), and erosion (wind and water pound on the exposed terrestrial ground). The bottoms of these ancient oceans exist in the form of sedimentary rock in many places on the planet. Many extinct species have left their fossilized impressions in these sedimentary layers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;Geologists have studied these layers around the world and have noted common species&amp;#39; patterns of fossils in these various layers. Generally speaking, the deeper the layers, the older the sediment and the more ancient the fossilized species. This relationship is so pervasive that geologists use fossils to describe the layer they are examining. (This has certain practical uses, as geologists looking for oil use the presence of certain fossilized species to know when their drills are approaching oil-bearing strata.) The geological time scale is based on the relative distribution of fossils in sedimentary layers. A close examination of these layers reveals various patterns in the distribution of various fossilized species at different depths (i.e., relative ages). Various changes in the patterns of fossilized species are noted and these are used to delineate four major eras: the Precambrian, the Paleozoic, the Mesozoic, and the Cenozoic. The geological time scale provides a relative time scale, but it does not directly establish an absolute time scale. Atomic physicists can determine absolute time scales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;Matter is composed of subatomic particles. Each atom of a particular element is characterized by the number of protons that exist within its central core. Also, in each core are a variable number of neutrons. Carbon, a prominent atom found in living organisms, has 6 protons. The most prevalent form of carbon has 6 protons and 6 neutrons and is referred to as carbon-12, or C12. However, a much less common form (and one that is unstable) also exists and is known as carbon-14, or C14 . This unstable form decays at regular intervals. The key here is &quot;regular intervals.&quot; It takes about 5600 years for 10 molecules of C14 to decay into 5 molecules of N14. In other words, C14 has a half-life of about 5600 years. So how does subatomic physics help establish an absolute dating method for fossils? Easy, well in theory at least; the technical details of how this is done can be a bit complex. As long as an organism is alive, it incorporates C14 and C12 into its body. At death, however, assimilation ceases. The carbon that is immobilized into the hard tissues is quite insoluble and resists decomposition. Slowly, but at a predictable rate, the C14 disappears. These two isotopes of carbon can be analytically separated and the ratio of the two can provide an absolute dating method for &quot;carbon-dating&quot; a sample. This method&amp;#39;s validity has been independently verified using dendrochronology. The carbon-14 dating method is fairly reliable for samples that are less than about 50,000 years old. For samples that are older, or that do not contain carbon, isotopes of other elements can be used. A new method that measures the decay of K20 into Ar20 shows great promise in dating samples as young as 2,000 years and as old as several billions years (the half-life of K20 is 1.25 billion years).&lt;/p&gt;</body>

	&lt;h2&gt;Mitosis/Cell Cycle Regulation&lt;/h2&gt;
	&lt;h3&gt;Terms:&lt;/h3&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;You should have a working knowledge of the following terms:&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;ul&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;anaphase&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;cell cycle&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;chromatid&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;cytokinesis&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;interphase&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;M phase&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;metaphase&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;metaphase plate&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;mitosis&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;prophase&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;telophase&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order for cells to give rise to new cells, all genetic information and cellular contents must be replicated. This tutorial will focus on the cell division in eukaryotic cells known as mitosis.&amp;nbsp; Mitosis is cell division for growth and repair in multicellular organisms.&amp;nbsp; By the end of this tutorial you should have a basic working understanding of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The phases of the cell cycle&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The major events of each stage of mitosis&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Chromosome movement during the cell cycle&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Cell Cycle&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Cell division is a precisely regulated process. Although&amp;nbsp;mitosis&amp;nbsp;is the process by which cell division occurs, many events need to take place prior to the physical separation of a mother cell into two daughter cells. Mitosis is a highly orchestrated process, with many checkpoints that insure events occur in the proper sequence. However, cells only divide at certain times and in specific situations.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Cell Components" src="assets/Tutorial25_animal_cell.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 201px;" title="Cell Components" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;All of the components of a cell must be replicated prior to cell division (only a fraction of the components are shown in this figure of an animal cell). The replication of new components is highly regulated. Only if the cell receives the proper signal (the nature of which is dependent on the particular cell and the environment in which it exists), will events be set in motion that lead to cell division. As long as the signal is present, the two new daughter cells will continue to replicate themselves in a cyclical process known as the&amp;nbsp;cell cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Animal Cell Components" src="assets/Tutorial25_cell_cycle.jpg" style="height: 253px; width: 300px;" title="Animal Cell Components" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cell cycle is a continuous process, but to make it easier to study it can be broken down into four phases. The&amp;nbsp;M phase&amp;nbsp;is the mitotic phase. The other three phases are collectively known as&amp;nbsp;interphase. The three phases of interphase following mitosis are: the the&amp;nbsp;G1&amp;nbsp;growth phase, the&amp;nbsp;S phase&amp;nbsp;or synthesis phase, which is when DNA is replicated, and the&amp;nbsp;G2&amp;nbsp;growth phase. Although the synthesis of nuclear DNA is restricted to the S phase, replication of cellular components can occur throughout the cell cycle (mostly being limited to G1, S, and G2).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Introduction to Mitosis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dynamic process of mitosis takes many eukaryotic cells about 1-3 hours to complete. During this time, the cell completes a number of stages. Often the process is simplified and drawn as discrete steps, but it is important to remember that these steps represent landmarks in a continuous process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To determine which stage of cell division is occurring during mitosis, one observes the behavior of the nucleus. The stages of mitosis are prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase. Each stage will be discussed next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Major Events of Mitosis: Prophase&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The first phase of mitosis,&amp;nbsp;prophase, is marked by the condensation of chromosomes.&amp;nbsp; During interphase, DNA is replicated and the replicated chromosomes remain relatively stretched out. It is difficult to visualize individual chromosomes prior to prophase using standard microscopy. This changes once the cell progresses into G2.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="DNA Organization" src="assets/Tutorial25_DNA_organization.jpg" style="width: 450px; height: 257px;" title="DNA Organization" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chromosomes begin to condense at some point during G2. In this complex process, each replicated elongated chromosome becomes supercoiled and, as a result, becomes considerably shorter and more tightly packed (depicted in this figure). Each replicated chromosome is only a few microns long, and by the end of prophase appears as two replicated&amp;nbsp;chromatids&amp;nbsp;attached at the&amp;nbsp;centromere. It is important to consider the significance of chromosome condensation; a highly compacted chromosome is easier to move than a stretched-out one. Moreover, chromosomes will physically be moved around in the cell later. If the DNA were stretched out, it would be subject to physical shearing. In the condensed form, it is less prone to physical damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="480" scrolling="no" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/_IzfJSxa-uA" width="640"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Major Events of Mitosis: Metaphase&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the spindle fibers begin attaching to the condensed chromosomes, a complex interaction begins between the mitotic spindle and the chromosomes. The chromosomes begin to jostle back and forth; the microtubules push and pull each of the attached chromosomes. This scenario marks the transition into&amp;nbsp;metaphase and represents an intricate cellular event whereby all of the chromosomes appear in a line (themetaphase plate) because the balance of forces drives the collection of all replicated and condensed chromosomes into a single plane in preparation for their segregation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Metaphase" src="assets/Tutorial25_metaphase.jpg" style="width: 450px; height: 357px;" title="Metaphase" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not understood how the cell &quot;knows&quot; when the chromosomes are precisely lined up. However, it is known that this is an important &quot;checkpoint&quot; and that the cell will not proceed to the next step until all of the chromosomes are properly positioned. The jostling of chromosomes can take a good deal of time. Therefore, this stage takes the longest time in most cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Major Events of Mitosis: Anaphase&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spindle fibers typically attach to replicated chromosomes at the centromere. Importantly, each chromatid has a centromere; therefore, in metaphase, the back-and-forth jostling results in chromosomes that are not only lined up in a single plane, but each sister chromatid is aligned opposite one another. This arrangement is well suited for accurate partitioning of the chromatid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the cell senses proper alignment along the metaphase plate, the replicated chromatids separate rapidly, signifyinganaphase. Three things happen during anaphase: first, the centromeres that hold the chromatids together dissolve, separating the pairs from each other; second, the newly freed chromatids (now properly called chromosomes) move rapidly toward the spindle poles; and third, the spindle poles move apart. Anaphase is a rapid process (in some cells it is completed within 5 minutes).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Major Events of Mitosis: Telophase and Cytokinesis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The replicated chromosomes (formally called chromatids) are at opposite ends of the spindle poles at the end of anaphase. Both halves of the cell contain equal numbers and kinds of chromosomes. At this point, the nuclear membranes of the daughter cells begin to reform around the new chromosomes located at either end of the cell. At the same time, the chromosomes begin to decondense. The decondensation of chromosomes and nuclear envelope reformation characterizes the&amp;nbsp;telophasestage of mitosis. Note that these two new nuclei contain identical genetic material. For instance, in a human cell there are 46 chromosomes: 23 of paternal origin and 23 of maternal origin. Telophase marks the last part of karyokinesis (the division of genetic material).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time that nuclear membranes are reforming during telophase, something remarkable is happening to the other cellular components. Remember, the other organelles have already replicated on their own. They are also being separated into the two ends of the cell. The cell then closes off the center of the parent cell, thereby forming two new daughter cells. This process of partitioning the parental cytoplasm (including organelles) is called&amp;nbsp;cytokinesis.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

		&lt;li&gt;sexual reproduction&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;sister chromatid&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;zygote&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Introduction and Goals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has long been noted that offspring resemble their parents in many ways, and that many traits are passed from one generation to the next. This is evident in the physical similarities of siblings, and in offspring and their parents. Although there are definite similarities between parents and offspring (and between offspring), there also is variation. After all, children never look entirely like either of their parents because they have inherited traits from both parents. Variation between generations is an important feature of natural selection because it provides the genetic basis of differential reproductive success. This tutorial will examine how chromosomes are passed from parents to offspring, and how this process gives rise to genetic variation in offspring. By the end of this tutorial you should be familiar with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Asexual and sexual reproduction&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Sexual life cycles&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Meiosis&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The two sources of genetic variation during meiosis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Types of Reproduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Organisms reproduce in one of two general ways: asexually or sexually. In&amp;nbsp;asexual reproduction&amp;nbsp;individuals (e.g., bacteria,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.micrographia.com/specbiol/cnidari/hydrozo/hydr0100/hydra-00.htm" target="_blank" title="Hydra"&gt;Hydra&lt;/a&gt;) produce genetically identical offspring termed&amp;nbsp;clones. For example, many plants can be cloned by vegetative propagation of root and stem cuttings.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Tutorial 2 Figure 1. Binary Fission" src="assets/Tutorial2_Figure%201%20Binary%20Fission.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 238px;" title="Tutorial 2 Figure 1. Binary Fission" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asexual reproduction is sometimes advantageous to organisms because it is generally quick and requires less energy. The major disadvantage of asexual reproduction is that offspring are genetically identical to the parent, and this lack of genetic variation may be detrimental if conditions change and genetic diversity becomes valuable. This situation could occur with the introduction of a new disease or predator, changing environmental conditions, or other factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In&amp;nbsp;sexual reproduction&amp;nbsp;the genetic material from two parents combines to form offspring who are genetically distinct from their parents (and who are also distinct from other siblings produced by the same parents). Even though sexual reproduction requires more energy and time than asexual reproduction, it provides offspring with a unique genetic makeup that may provide them with a selective advantage in an unpredictable environment. The key to understanding how this genetic variation is maintained lies in examining the behavior of chromosomes during the sexual&amp;nbsp;life cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many of the organisms we will discuss, the exchange (or recombination) of genetic information is obligatorily coupled to reproduction, which is why such an organism is characterized as undergoing sexual reproduction. However, the exchange (or recombination) of genetic information is not always coupled to reproduction. For example, conjugation in bacteria can be accompanied by a brief exchange of genetic material without division; so, bacteria can engage in a form of sex (i.e., exchange of genetic material) known as conjugation and also undergo asexual reproduction (binary fission). Sex and reproduction are not always linked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Chromosomes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The inheritance of traits is due to the transmission of&amp;nbsp;genes&amp;nbsp;from parents to offspring, and these genes code for the physical similarities that we observe. A gene is a heritable unit. In cells, nuclear DNA is organized into chromosomes. Genes occupy specific positions on chromosomes. More than one form of a gene may exist, and these alternative forms of the gene (alleles) result in the formation of slightly different proteins and enzymes that sometimes manifest themselves as differences in physical appearance, physiological functioning, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;img alt="Chromosome Breakdown" src="assets/Tutorial2_Chromosome.jpg" style="height: 518px; width: 400px;" title="Chromosome Breakdown" /&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;By passing chromosomes from parents to offspring, genes are transmitted from one generation to the next resulting in similarities between parents and offspring. All eukaryotic organisms have their genetic material subdivided into chromosomes, although the number of chromosomes differs by species (e.g., humans have 46 chromosomes, dogs have 78, cats have 34, and mosquitoes have only 6). Regardless of the number of chromosomes, the underlying principles of inheritance are the same for all species. To better understand the scale and relationship of nucleotide sequences, genes and chromosomes, examine the figure illustrating the Comparative Scale of Mapping below.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Comparative Scale of Mapping" src="assets/Tutorial2_Compartive%20Scale%20of%20Mapping1.jpg" style="width: 400px; height: 424px;" title="Comparative Scale of Mapping" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In normal humans, any cell that is not a sperm or ovum contains 46 chromosomes. These 46 chromosomes actually occur as 23 pairs of chromosomes, and the two chromosomes in a pair are identical in length and shape (except in males, who have one pair of nonidentical chromosomes: an X and a Y chromosome). The two chromosomes in the pair also have the same genes; if a gene for hair color is located at one location on one chromosome (commonly referred to as a locus; plural, loci), its&amp;nbsp;homologous chromosome&amp;nbsp;will have the hair color gene at the same location. Importantly, the homologues may or may not have the same allele for the gene. This is because one homologue comes from each parent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Life Cycles&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;This figure illustrates the human life cycle. Adults produce&amp;nbsp;gametes&amp;nbsp;(reproductive cells termed sperm and eggs) by&amp;nbsp;meiosis&amp;nbsp; (a type of nuclear division), and each gamete contains only one-half the number of chromosomes found in the nonreproductive cells of the parent. The nonreproductive cells (containing 46 chromosomes) are called&amp;nbsp;diploid cells, and are abbreviated as &quot;2n.&quot; The gametes (containing 23 chromosomes) are called&amp;nbsp;haploid cells, and are abbreviated as &quot;n.&quot; When a haploid ovum and a haploid sperm unite through&amp;nbsp;fertilization, a diploidzygote&amp;nbsp;is produced. This life cycle describes how diploid (2n) adults produce haploid (n) gametes, which then unite to form a new diploid (2n) zygote.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 2. The Human Life Cycle" src="assets/Tutorial2_Figure2TheHumanLifeCycle.jpg" style="width: 400px; height: 351px;" title="Figure 2. The Human Life Cycle" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This alternation of meiosis and fertilization is found in the sexual life cycles of all sexually reproducing organisms, but its timing can differ considerably depending on the organism. The human life cycle typifies the most common life cycle found in animals, where the gametes are the only haploid cells. They combine to form a zygote, which divides by mitosis (another type of nuclear division) and grows to form a new individual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a second type of life cycle, as seen in most fungi and some protists (unicellular eukaryotes and their somewhat simple multicellular relatives), the diploid zygote produces haploid cells by meiosis; these develop into free-living, haploid multicellular organisms. These haploid organisms then produce modified gametes by mitosis (they are already haploid, therefore, they cannot undergo meiosis), and these gametes unite to form diploid zygotes. Some plants and algae exhibit yet another type of life cycle, which will be described when we discuss plants and algae later in this course. Although these three types of life cycles differ in the timing of fertilization and meiosis, they all produce genetic variation in their offspring. Next we will examine the process of meiosis and see how genetic variation arises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Meiosis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Organisms such as humans have two haploid sets of chromosomes, one set inherited from a male in the sperm and the second set from a female in the egg. Thus, we have a duplicate set of each of our 23 chromosomes. A pair of duplicate chromosomes is known as a homologous pair. Each generation, human males and females reduce their chromosome numbers in half, but must insure that each gamete has a complete set of half of the chromosomes.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;h2&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 3. Meiosis" src="assets/Tutorial2_Figure3Meiosis.jpg" style="width: 400px; height: 241px;" title="Figure 3. Meiosis" /&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The primary function of meiosis in diploid organisms is the proper distribution of homologous chromosomes. Meiosis has three essential phases, (1) pairing of homologous chromosomes, (2) locking of the chromosomes together via crossing over, and disjunction or segregation of the chromosomes into two daughter cells. As shown in this figure, cells go from the diploid to haploid state through an initial replication of chromosomes (resulting in&amp;nbsp;sister chromatids&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;nonsister chromatids), followed by two divisions called meiosis I and meiosis II. At the conclusion of meiosis, four daughter cells are formed, each with one-half the normal number of chromosomes. One consequence of meiosis isthat new genetic diversity arises due to two factors: the independent assortment of homologous chromosomes to gametes, and crossing over (recombination) in prophase I of meiosis. Before we examine these two factors, you must first familiarize yourself with the process of meiosis. To do so, view the illustrations of meiosis below.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Meiosis" src="assets/Tutorial2_Meiosis.jpg" style="width: 400px; height: 537px;" title="Meiosis" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that you are familiar with meiosis, let&amp;#39;s examine the factors that lead to genetic diversity in this process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Independent Assortment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The first source of genetic variation,&amp;nbsp;independent assortment, occurs in metaphase I, when the homologous chromosomes line up on the metaphase plate. Orientation of the pairs is random; therefore, which chromosome (maternal or paternal) goes to each daughter cell is random. A particular daughter cell has a 50% chance of getting either the maternal or paternal chromosome for each homologous pair. This figure illustrates two pairs of homologous chromosomes and how their random alignment at the metaphase plate can lead to different combinations of chromosomes in the daughter cells that are produced. The chromosome pairs align independently of one another. Therefore, the number of different combinations of chromosomes in the daughter cells is equal to 2n, where n = the haploid number of chromosomes (or the number of chromosome pairs). In this example there are two chromosomes, so there are 22&amp;nbsp;= 4 different chromosome combinations in the daughter cells. If we look at the whole human genetic complement (n = 23), the number of different combinations is 223&amp;nbsp;= 8,388,608. Due only to the independent assortment of chromosomes in meiosis I, over 8 million genetically distinct gametes can be produced.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 4. Meiosis I" src="assets/Tutorial2_Figure4MeiosisI.jpg" style="width: 400px; height: 361px;" title="Figure 4. Meiosis I" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When making these computations, calculate the number of possibilities using the number of pairs, not the total number of chromosomes; remember that sex chromosomes are not homologous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Crossing Over&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;A second source of genetic variation during meiosis is the exchange of genetic material between the maternal and paternal chromosomes, a process called&amp;nbsp;crossing over&amp;nbsp;or&amp;nbsp;recombination. While the homologous chromosomes are paired together in prophase I, pieces of one chromosome may be exchanged with the identical portion of the other chromosome. This means that the resulting chromosomes are not entirely maternal or paternal, but rather a mixture of both. In humans, crossing over occurs about 2-3 times per chromosome pair, between nonsister chromatids only (not between sister chromatids).&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a assets/Tutorial2_Figure5CrossingOver.jpg" rel="lightbox[][Figure 5. Crossing Over]"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 5. Crossing Over" src="assets/Tutorial2_Figure5CrossingOver.jpg" style="width: 715px; height: 295px;" title="Figure 5. Crossing Over" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;View the animation below to reinforce the concept of crossing over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As previously described, meiosis gives rise to genetic variation through the independent assortment of chromosomes and recombination between pairs of homologous chromosomes. If we also consider random fertilization, the amount of genetic variation increases more. Let&amp;#39;s consider the example of a human couple having a child. Over 8 million different genetic combinations are possible in the father&amp;#39;s sperm, and an equal number in the mother&amp;#39;s ovum. The number of unique genetic combinations would be (8 million)(8 million) = 64 trillion when a sperm and ovum randomly unite to form a zygote. Therefore, sexual reproduction is an effective way to create offspring with genetic variation. Why is this important?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Populations evolve through natural selection. In order for natural selection to operate, genetic variation must be present. Genetic variation leads to heterogeneity between generations; if the environment favors one variant, then this advantageous variant will increase in frequency over generational time. If environmental conditions change, individuals migrate, or new predators or pathogens are introduced, then genetic variation may enable some individuals to do better in these new conditions. Therefore, genetic variation is &quot;insurance&quot; for organisms against changing conditions because it helps to insure that some of their offspring will survive if conditions change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tutorial demonstrated how traits are passed from one generation to the next. In each generation, sexually reproducing eukaryotes undergo a series of reproductive events that can be summarized by a life cycle. There are some differences in the details of various life cycles, but in essence the life cycle describes how the genetic composition of the cells involved in reproduction alternates between a 1n (haploid) and 2n (diploid) state. Superficially, this seems simple and straightforward; that is, two haploid gametes fuse (at some point in the life cycle), resulting in a diploid (2n) organism; one or more cells in this 2n organism then (at some point) undergo meiosis, giving rise to haploid gametes that potentially go on to form the next generation, etc. However, this is only part of the importance of the life cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mechanisms involved in the haploid/diploid/haploid transitions lead to genetic variation. All eukaryotic organisms have the majority of their DNA arranged in a set of chromosomes (found within the nucleus). Humans have 46 chromosomes (2n). Our gametes have 23 chromosomes (1n). Each of us received half of our chromosomes from each parent. However, the combination of 23 chromosomes received from each of our parents was not the same complement that our siblings received (which explains why most siblings look similar but nonidentical). This scenario provides a major source of variation between generations (as does crossing over between paternal and maternal chromosomes).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of our 23 haploid chromosomes has a similar but nonidentical partner termed a homologue. It is essential to remember that homologues are not identical. Therefore, the diploid composition can be described as 23 pairs of homologous chromosomes. During meiosis, these homologues will be segregated into four progeny cells, each of which will have a haploid chromosome complement. The cellular process by which these similar, yet nonidentical, chromosomes are physically moved during meiosis results in a random distribution of the 23 chromosomes into the haploid cells. Because this process occurs randomly, we can use statistics to predict the number of possible outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In metaphase I of meiosis, the replicated chromosomes appear situated in a row with the homologues lined up opposite one another. Importantly, how they pair is random. For example, the paternal homologue of chromosome 1 may line up on one side, whereas the paternal homologue of chromosome 2 may line up on the other side (remember, then the maternal pair would be on opposite sides as well). The odds that the paternal member of a given homologous pair lines up on one side is equal to 50% (or 0.5 or 1:1); i.e., it goes either on one side or the other. The odds that the paternal members of two chromosomes line up on the same side is then a product of their individual probabilities; i.e., 0.5 x 0.5 = 0.25 (or 1:4). What would be the odds of all 23 paternal chromosomes lining up on one side? The solution is 223&amp;nbsp;or 1 in 8 million. This is also the odds of any other specific combination occurring during metaphase I. In metaphase II, the segregated homologues will separate. There is only one way this will occur, so the probabilities outlined for the events at metaphase I can be extended to the entire process of meiosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s put together the events occurring during meiosis for both parents. If the combination for a specific arrangement of chromosomes in each parent is 8 million, what are the odds of a specific diploid arrangement occurring? (Fertilization is somewhat random and therefore can be described statistically.) Again, the probability is a product of their independent probabilities, which is 8 million x 8 million = 64 trillion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process of random segregation of chromosomes during meiosis provides for an incredible amount of potential variation. Crossing over in prophase I adds another level of variation to the genetic character of gametes, and this will be explored in more detail later.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <title>Pedigree Analysis</title>
    <body>&lt;h2&gt;Terms&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should have a working knowledge of the following terms:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;carrier&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;pedigree&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Introduction and Goals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genetics is not an abstract science. You probably can see inheritance patterns in your own family. Usually these patterns relate to ear shape, eye color and hair color, etc. This tutorial will show you how a pedigree analysis can provide insight into the genotype of relatives. You will also look at some of the more common human genetic diseases. By the time you finish this tutorial you should have a basic working knowledge of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Pedigree analysis&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Cystic fibrosis&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Huntington&amp;#39;s disease&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Sickle-cell disease&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Phenylketonuria&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The inheritance of dominant and recessive traits&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mendelian Inheritance in Humans&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mendelian inheritance in humans is difficult to study because humans produce relatively few offspring (as compared to most other species) and they have a generation time of about 20 years. These two factors, not to mention ethical issues, make it impossible to design breeding experiments using humans. Nonetheless, there are few traits that are passed on by Mendelian inheritance (e.g., dimples, freckles, and hairlines).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Pedigrees&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our understanding of Mendelian inheritance in humans is based on the analysis of matings that have already occurred (the opposite of planned experiments), a family &lt;strong&gt;pedigree&lt;/strong&gt;. Human pedigrees describe the interrelationships between parents and children, over generations, regarding a specific trait. Mendel&amp;#39;s laws of inheritance can be used to analyze the pedigree and genotypes of the individuals in the pedigree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to read family pedigrees, it is important to understand the conventions of pedigrees; as shown on the &lt;a class="external-link ext" href="http://faculty.clintoncc.suny.edu/faculty/michael.gregory/files/Bio%20101/Bio%20101%20Laboratory/Pedigree%20Analysis/PEDIGREE.HTM" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;Pedigree Analysis Web&lt;/a&gt; page. After reading and understanding the analysis of pedigrees, close the Mendelian Genetics window and return to this page&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Inheritance of Recessive Traits&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial6_Figure%201%20Recessive%20pedigree.jpg" style="width: 250px; height: 185px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This figure shows the pattern of inheritance that can be observed for a recessive trait. The half-filled symbols denote &lt;strong&gt;carriers&lt;/strong&gt; (heterozygotes). Note that an individual expressing a recessive trait (homozygous recessive) may not appear every generation, but carriers are still present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="lightbox lightbox-processed"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 2. Pedigree for the recessive albinism trait" class="lightbox" src="assets/Tutorial6_Figure%202%20Albinism.jpg" style="float: ; width: 430px; height: 267px; margin: 10px;" title="Figure 2. Pedigree for the recessive albinism trait" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This figure shows the pattern of inheritance for albinism, which typically shows a recessive mode of inheritance in humans. In this pedigree (as with most pedigree charts) heterozygotes are not marked, but you can infer their presence by the pattern of expression. Take a close look at this pedigree and locate the two cousins who marry and have children. Can you see why most societies have taboos regarding the marriage of first cousins?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Disease Inheritance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="0" src="http://c.gigcount.com/wildfire/IMP/CXNID=2000002.0NXC/bT*xJmx*PTEzMDc*NjQ*NDM4NjImcHQ9MTMwNzQ2NDQ*NjE*MyZwPTIwNjQyMSZkPWIyMDk4MTczJmc9MiZvPTk2NjhhNGRlZDA4/NDRmNzlhYTY1ZTI4N2RlOTA2Y2E4Jm9mPTA=.gif" style="visibility: hidden; width: 0px; height: 0px;" width="0" /&gt;Next we will examine three diseases caused by deleterious recessive alleles: &lt;strong&gt;cystic fibrosis&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;phenylketonuria&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;sickle-cell&lt;/strong&gt; disease. Phenotypically normal parents must both be carriers (heterozygous) in order for the disease to be observed in their offspring. Remember, these are recessively inherited traits; an individual must inherit one allele from each carrier parent to exhibit the phenotype. Each time two carriers conceive a child, there is a 25% chance that the child will exhibit the phenotype, a 50% chance that the child will be a carrier, and a 25% chance that the child will be a non-carrier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;object align="" data="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2098173" height="480" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="640"&gt;&lt;param name="quality" value="high" /&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2098173" /&gt;&lt;param name="wmode" value="transparent" /&gt;&lt;embed height="480" hspace="10" quality="high" src="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2098173" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" vspace="10" width="640" wmode="transparent"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cystic Fibrosis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cystic fibrosis (CF) is one of the most common genetic diseases that affects people of Caucasian ancestry. In a room of 20-30 such persons, approximately one is a carrier. The deleterious allele that causes this disease encodes for a protein that is involved in chloride ion transport; as a result, individuals with homozygous alleles for this gene have extreme problems with salt balance in cells (particularly those cells that line the lungs and intestines). This salt imbalance causes the mucous coating of certain cells to become unusually thick, causing affected individuals to have an extreme buildup of mucous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does a salt imbalance lead to thick mucous? The answer lies in understanding osmosis. Affected individuals accumulate salt in their epithelial cells (the cells that line body cavities). As a result, the cells become hypertonic (relative to outside the cell) and water is drawn into the cell. The mucous that lies outside the cell (which normally is relatively thin and watery) becomes thickened. This viscous mucous does not clear as efficiently as does normal mucous. This disease is pleiotropic, and a number of symptoms can result (e.g., lung infections, sterility in males).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is this deleterious allele so prevalent if it is so bad? Molecular evolutionary analyses of this allele indicate that it first appeared about 52,000 years ago (about the time when nearby eastern human populations were invading Europe to displace the Neanderthals). The prevalence of this gene in modern populations, along with its age, compels researchers to conclude that there must have been some selective advantage for the heterozygous state. What was this advantage? No one knows for sure. Read a short article entitled&lt;a href="http://bric.postech.ac.kr/science/97now/98_5now/980506b.html"&gt; &quot;A Silver Lining for Cystic Fibrosis?&lt;/a&gt;&quot; that presents one possibility. When you return, consider what could be one reason Cystic Fibrosis may have persisted because of Heterozygotic Advantage?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Phenylketonuria&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phenylketonuria (PKU) is not as prevalent as cystic fibrosis. About 1 in 50 persons of Caucasian ancestry carry the defective allele. (1 in 64 persons of Asian ancestry have this allele; write this number down because you will need it to answer the next question.) The disease is only observed in individuals that are homozygous for the recessive allele, and the main symptom of PKU is mental retardation. The defective allele encodes for a nonfunctional phenylalanine hydrolase enzyme that normally converts the amino acid phenylalanine to the amino acid tyrosine. Those affected with PKU accumulate high levels of phenylalanine (and/or its metabolites), therefore, they have low levels of tyrosine. The high levels of phenylalanine metabolites affect neuronal development, which leads to mental retardation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Importantly, the symptoms associated with this disease can be prevented with proper nutrition. Phenylalanine is an amino acid found in many proteins; therefore, patients affected with PKU can escape the disease by strictly limiting themselves to low protein diets. Providing that PKU is detected early (most states require that all newborns be tested), proper nutrition will prevent the disease. There are doctors, lawyers, and teachers who are homozygous for PKU, yet they lead relatively normal lives (albeit with a life-long restricted diet).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PKU is a good example of not only a disease caused by a recessive allele, but also an example of a genetic state whereby the phenotype is strongly affected by the environment - with the proper diet, the phenotype is not expressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sickle-Cell Anemia&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sickle-cell disease is one of the most common genetic diseases that affects persons of African ancestry. About 10% of such persons carry the allele for this trait. (In some areas of Africa, upwards of 40% carry the allele.) Individuals that carry homozygous alleles for sickle-cell disease suffer from a number of problems including anemia, pain, fever, and fatigue. The sickle-cell trait affects the hemoglobin molecule found in red blood cells, which is involved in oxygen transport. Left untreated, patients with sickle-cell disease typically die by the age of thirty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with cystic fibrosis, the prevalence of the allele in the population suggests that there is some benefit to carrying it in a heterozygous state. Indeed, this is the case. It is known that those individuals with heterozygous alleles are less susceptible to malaria than those with homozygous alleles. It is not surprising then that the highest frequency of this allele is found in areas where malaria is prevalent. This allele is probably the best example of natural selection in humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Inheritance of Dominant Traits&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="lightbox lightbox-processed" assets/Tutorial6_Figure 3. Wooly Hair2_0.jpg" id="Figure 3. Pedigree of Wooly Hair" rel="lightbox[][Figure 3. Pedigree of Wooly Hair]" title="Figure 3. Pedigree of Wooly Hair"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 3. Pedigree of Wooly Hair" class="lightbox" src="assets/Tutorial6_Figure%203.%20Wooly%20Hair.jpg" style="width: 250px; height: 138px; margin: 10px;" title="Figure 3. Pedigree of Wooly Hair" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Example 1. Wooly hair results from a dominant allele; therefore, individuals that are homozygous dominant (WW) or heterozygous (Ww) have this trait. Individuals that are homozygous recessive (ww) for this gene have normal hair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial6_Figure%204%20Brachydactyly.jpg" style="width: 400px; height: 298px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Example 2. Brachydactyly - a condition associated with shortness of fingers and toes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pedigree examples shown here best fit a dominant pattern of inheritance because:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The trait does not skip a generation.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Where one parent is affected, about half of the progeny are affected.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Sexes are about equally affected.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Huntington&amp;#39;s Chorea&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Huntingtons Disease&lt;/strong&gt; (HD) is a hereditary disease that causes progressive damage to the nervous system. It generally develops subtly in a person&amp;#39;s thirties or forties (though it can begin any time between childhood and old age). It is characterized by difficulties in three areas: uncontrollable movements, dementia, and psychiatric disturbances. Unlike the previous diseases described, which were caused by recessive alleles, HD is caused by a dominant allele. Most HD sufferers have one copy of the deleterious allele and one normal allele, so each child has a 50% chance of inheriting the disease. As you just read in the description of inheritance of dominant traits, HD does not skip generations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to note the late onset of this disease. This disease becomes noticeable after the normal child-bearing age. Also, consider that the life expectancy of men in America in the year 1900 was forty-six. Therefore, for much of modern human history (about 100,000-150,000 years) this disease probably was not prevalent because people died of other causes before HD symptoms appeared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Using Pedigrees&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="lightbox lightbox-processed"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 5. Wooly Hair" class="lightbox" src="assets/Tutorial6_Figure%203.%20Wooly%20Hair2.jpg" style="float: ; width: 250px; height: 138px; margin: 10px;" title="Figure 5. Wooly Hair" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Presented here is a pedigree for wooly hair.&lt;br class="atl-forced-newline" /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	The man at the top of the pedigree has normal hair, so his genotype is ww. His wife has wooly hair, but must be heterozygous (Ww) since three of their six children have normal hair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A pedigree not only allows a geneticist to understand the past, but it helps to predict the occurrence of a trait in future generations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a wooly hair grandson marries a normal hair woman and they plan on having three children, the probability that all three children will have wooly hair is &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;. Since the man is heterozygous (Ww) and the wife is homozygous (ww), each child has a &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; probability of inheriting the wooly hair allele (&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; X &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; X &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;object align="" classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0" data="https://online.science.psu.edu/sites/default/files/biol110/Tutorial6_pedigreeEmbed.swf" height="480" hspace="10" title=" This animation will help you check your understanding of pedigree analysis.

&lt;h2&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pattern of phenotypic expression can be quite useful in determining the mode of transmission for a given characteristic. In fact, geneticists often study the expression of particular traits in family lineages, or pedigrees, in order to gain insight into the mode of expression for a given character trait. Not only can pedigree analyses provide insight into the mode of transmission, but importantly, they can be used to predict the genotype of particular individuals. This tutorial examined some human genetic diseases, including cystic fibrosis, PKU, and sickle-cell disease. These diseases are found in individuals that are homozygous for the gene, but as you learned, the heterozygous state has a well-documented advantage in the case of the sickle-cell disease and a probable advantage in the case of cystic fibrosis. Moreover, you learned that the phenotype can be affected by the environment; in the case of PKU, a person that is homozygous for the gene can escape the disease with a proper diet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;object align="" data="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2098185" height="480" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="640"&gt;&lt;param name="quality" value="high" /&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2098185" /&gt;&lt;param name="wmode" value="transparent" /&gt;&lt;embed height="480" hspace="10" quality="high" src="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2098185" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" vspace="10" width="640" wmode="transparent"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not all genetic diseases that behave in a Mendelian fashion behave recessively. Huntington&amp;#39;s disease is a degenerative disease of the nervous system. Individuals with either homozygous or heterozygous genotypes develop this disease, ensuring that the defective allele is expressed in all generations as a dominant character trait. Individuals carrying this dominant allele do not begin to show symptoms until late in life (after their child-bearing years), and so, natural selection cannot act directly to affect the frequency of this allele in the population. In other words, through their reproductive years, individuals with this detrimental allele are just as fit (likely to reproduce) as normal individuals.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;You should have a working knowledge of the following terms:&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h1 style="text-align: justify;"&gt;Introduction and Goals&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;This tutorial emphasizes the work of Gregor Mendel, the father of modern genetics. Mendel was the first scientist to examine, in a quantitative manner, the behavior of traits between generations. By looking at the proportions of progeny, he was able to infer the basic tenets of modern genetics. By the conclusion of this tutorial you should have a basic understanding of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul style="text-align: justify;"&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Mendel and modern genetics&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The distinction between characters and traits&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Meiosis and the segregation of alleles&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The molecular relationship between genotype and phenotype&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The laws of segregation and independent assortment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 style="text-align: justify;"&gt;Modern Genetics&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: justify;"&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Johann Gregor Mendel was born in 1822 and was raised on his parents small farm, in what is now the Czech Republic. After attending high school and the Olmutz Philosophical Institute, Mendel became a friar at an Augustinian monastery in Brno in 1843 at the age of 21. After several years of theological study, Mendel failed his teacher&amp;#39;s examination and was sent to the University of Vienna (Austria) for two years of study from 1851-1853.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial3_Figure1Mendel.jpg" title="Figure. Johann Gregor Mendel" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;He returned to the monastery and began his studies of inheritance with pea plants (&lt;em&gt;Pisum&lt;/em&gt;) grown in the monastery&amp;#39;s garden. He published his work in 1865; however, it went largely unnoticed until its rediscovery in 1900, sixteen years after his death. Mendel&amp;#39;s experiments demonstrated many of the basic principles of genetics, and so, his studies are used to illustrate the first principles of inheritance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 style="text-align: justify;"&gt;Characters (Genes) and Traits (Alleles)&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;Mendel probably chose to work with pea plants because of the many variants that exist in their &lt;strong&gt;morphology&lt;/strong&gt; (physical appearance). The color of the flowers, seeds, and pods can differ between individuals, as well as the position of the flower on the stem, the length of the stem, and the shape of the seeds and pods. &lt;em&gt;Pisum&lt;/em&gt; provided Mendel with a wide variety of characteristics with which to examine patterns of inheritance. At this point, we need to introduce the terms that Mendel referred to as a character and a trait.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;Mendel defined a character as a heritable feature for which variants exist, and a trait as a particular variant for the character. For example, flower color is a character, whereas purple and white are traits. Today, we use the term &quot;gene&quot; to refer to a character and &quot;allele&quot; to refer to a trait.&amp;nbsp; For example, in pea plants there is a gene for flower color and the two alleles are purple and white. Other characters (and traits) that he studied included: seed color (yellow or green); seed shape (round or wrinkled); pod shape (inflated or restricted); flower position (terminal or axial); and plant height (tall or dwarf).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;object align="left" data="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2092519" height="480" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="640"&gt;&lt;param name="quality" value="high" /&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2092519" /&gt;&lt;param name="wmode" value="transparent" /&gt;&lt;embed align="bottom" height="480" hspace="10" quality="high" src="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2092519" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" vspace="10" width="640" wmode="transparent"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h1 style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Molecular Relationship Between Genotype and Phenotype&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: ;"&gt;This figure illustrates the relationship between genotypes and phenotypes, with flower color used as an example. An organism&amp;#39;s &lt;strong&gt;genotype&lt;/strong&gt; is its genetic makeup for a particular trait; that is, a listing of its alleles at a given location. The &lt;strong&gt;phenotype&lt;/strong&gt; is the organism&amp;#39;s appearance; that is, the trait produced by the alleles at the location for that trait. How does the genotype for a trait lead to the phenotype? The different alleles at a given location differ in their DNA sequences, thereby producing different enzymes when transcribed into RNA. These enzymes can have different levels of activity; therefore, the organism&amp;#39;s phenotype will differ depending on the enzymes present. The manner in which gene products interact to determine the phenotype is usually complex. The example provided below should help to clarify the relationship between genotype and phenotype.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;In peas, the character &quot;flower color&quot; has two traits: the dominant purple flower and the recessive white flower.&amp;nbsp; The &lt;strong&gt;dominant allele&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; codes for a functional enzyme that creates a pigment that makes the flower purple. The &lt;strong&gt;recessive allele&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;, however, has a defect in its DNA sequence and results in a nonfunctional enzyme - no pigment is produced and the flower appears white. .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;In individuals with two copies of the recessive allele (&lt;em&gt;pp&lt;/em&gt;), have white flowers because both copies of their allele code for nonfunctional pigment-producing enzyme.&amp;nbsp; An individual that is &lt;em&gt;PP&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Pp&lt;/em&gt;, on the other hand, has at least one functional version of the pigment-producing allele and thus has purple flowers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 style="text-align: justify;"&gt;Mendel&amp;#39;s Technique for Crossing Peas&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: justify;"&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;In addition to Pisum&amp;#39;s variety of characters and traits with which to study patterns of inheritance, Mendel also probably chose to study peas because their reproduction can be easily controlled, which afforded him strict control over the mating of different individuals. The general process is shown in this figure. Peas will often &lt;strong&gt;self-fertilize&lt;/strong&gt; (also termed &quot;selfing&quot;), transferring pollen from the stamens to the carpel on the same flower. The ease by which peas can be &quot;selfed&quot; played an important role in Mendel&amp;#39;s studies. In some cases, Mendel wanted to cross plants with different traits. This required that he prevent selfing by removing the immature stamens before they produced pollen; he then brushed the carpel with pollen from another individual. This enabled him to control the fertilization process, and therefore the parentage of each individual. The pollinated carpel matured into a pod, and the seeds within the pod were planted to give rise to a new generation of adult plants. The mature plants (produced by the seeds) were then examined for traits, and the process repeated again as desired. This manipulation made it possible for Mendel to keep track of the parents of each individual, and to examine how traits were transmitted through generations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h1 style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h1 style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h1 style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h1 style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h1 style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h1 style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h1 style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h1 style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h1 style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h1 style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h1 style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h1 style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h1 style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h1 style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h1 style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h1 style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h1 style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h1 style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h1 style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h1 style="text-align: justify;"&gt;Mendel&amp;#39;s Crosses&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: justify;"&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Mendel tracked heritable characters for three generations. In the first generation, the &lt;strong&gt;P generation&lt;/strong&gt; (parental generation), Mendel crossed two &quot;&lt;strong&gt;true-breeding&lt;/strong&gt;&quot; parents with differing traits for one or more characters. &quot;True-breeding&quot; means that all of the offspring of that individual have the same trait as the parent when the offspring are produced by self-pollination. In this figure, the individual with white flowers was true-breeding because all of the offspring produced from a self-pollination had white flowers. Similarly, the individual with purple flowers only produced offspring with purple flowers when self-pollinated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;The crossing of two true-breeding parents produced an &lt;strong&gt;F&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;generation&lt;/strong&gt; of hybrid individuals that exhibited only the trait found in one of the two parents. The trait that was expressed in the F&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; generation was termed a &lt;strong&gt;dominant trait&lt;/strong&gt;. The F&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; generation hybrids were then each self-pollinated, producing an &lt;strong&gt;F&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;generation&lt;/strong&gt;. Although not present in the F&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; generation, the trait exhibited by the one parent reappeared in this generation, invariably at approximately a 3:1 ratio of one parental trait to the other. The trait that reappeared in the F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; generation was termed a &lt;strong&gt;recessive trait&lt;/strong&gt; because it receded in the previous generation. Mendel counted large numbers (hundreds to thousands) of offspring in the F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; generation, allowing him to analyze his results mathematically; from which he determined the mode and manner of inheritance in this species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 style="text-align: justify;"&gt;Ratios&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;The key to understanding Mendelian genetics is to understand what ratios are and how to determine them. Let&amp;#39;s do a few exercises to insure that you are familiar with ratios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 style="text-align: justify;"&gt;Ratio order&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;In ratios, order means everything. In the example shown above, the F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; generation had a 3:1 ratio of individuals with purple to white flowers. The same results could be written as a 1:3 ratio of white to purple flowers. Therefore, the order of the traits listed within the ratio are important because the first number in the ratio is related to the first trait listed and the second number in the ratio corresponds to the second trait.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 style="text-align: justify;"&gt;Converting counts to ratios&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;Some of Mendel&amp;#39;s actual data are listed below. Note that the ratios are obtained by dividing the larger of the two counts by the smaller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="table-wrap" style="text-align: justify;"&gt;
	&lt;table class="confluenceTable"&gt;
		&lt;tbody&gt;
			&lt;tr&gt;
				&lt;td class="confluenceTd"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Flower color&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br class="atl-forced-newline" /&gt;
					&lt;br /&gt;
					Purple = 705 individuals&lt;br class="atl-forced-newline" /&gt;
					&lt;br /&gt;
					White = 224 individuals&lt;br class="atl-forced-newline" /&gt;
					&lt;br /&gt;
					705/224 = 3.15&lt;br class="atl-forced-newline" /&gt;
					&lt;br /&gt;
					Ratio of purple:white&lt;br class="atl-forced-newline" /&gt;
					&lt;br /&gt;
					flowers is 3.15:1&lt;/td&gt;
				&lt;td class="confluenceTd"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pod shape&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br class="atl-forced-newline" /&gt;
					&lt;br /&gt;
					Inflated = 882 individuals&lt;br class="atl-forced-newline" /&gt;
					&lt;br /&gt;
					Constricted = 299 individuals&lt;br class="atl-forced-newline" /&gt;
					&lt;br /&gt;
					882/299 = 2.95&lt;br class="atl-forced-newline" /&gt;
					&lt;br /&gt;
					Ratio of inflated:constricted&lt;br class="atl-forced-newline" /&gt;
					&lt;br /&gt;
					pods is 2.95:1&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;/tr&gt;
		&lt;/tbody&gt;
	&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;An examination of the ratios listed above shows that they are all approximately a 3:1 ratio, some being slightly higher and others slightly lower. The inheritance of traits is governed in some respects by probability (as you will learn in upcoming exercises), therefore, it is sometimes advisable to round off ratios to the nearest whole number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;The relationship between ratios and fractions can be confusing. A ratio of 1:3 means that there are four &quot;units&quot; being considered. In other words, 1:3 does not mean 33% have one trait, while 66% have the other. Rather, 1:3 means that 25% (1 unit) have one trait and 75% (3 units) have the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 style="text-align: justify;"&gt;Estimating Offspring Counts from Ratios&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0" data="https://online.science.psu.edu/sites/default/files/biol110/Tutorial3_MendelsCross.swf" height="480" width="640"&gt;&lt;param name="quality" value="high" /&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="https://online.science.psu.edu/sites/default/files/biol110/Tutorial3_MendelsCross.swf" /&gt;&lt;embed height="480" pluginspage="http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer" quality="high" src="assets/Tutorial3_MendelsCross.swf" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="640"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;Just as you can calculate ratios from counts of offspring, you can also work backwards and estimate offspring counts from ratios. Let&amp;#39;s do an example to demonstrate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;You cross two true-breeding parents, one with purple flowers and one with white flowers, grow and self-pollinate the F&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; generation, and then count the number of offspring with purple and white flowers. If you counted 1,000 offspring and there was a 3:1 ratio of purple:white flowers, how many offspring would have purple flowers? How many would have white flowers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;Pull out a piece of paper and pencil (and/or your calculator) to see if you can get the right answer before viewing the solution below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 style="text-align: justify;"&gt;Ratio Problem Solution&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = total number of offspring = 1,000&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	3:1 ratio = total of 4 &quot;units&quot; (3 + 1 = 4)&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; of units have purple flowers, &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; have white flowers (Recall, there was a 3:1 ratio of purple:white flowers.)&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; = 75%, &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; = 25%&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	75% purple flowers, 25% white flowers&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Convert to decimal equivalent: 0.75 purple flowers, 0.25 white flowers&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Numbers = &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; X 0.75 for purple, &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; X 0.25 for white&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	purple = 1,000 X 0.75 = 750, white = 1,000 X 0.25 = 250&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;Estimate = 750 offspring with purple flowers, 250 with white flowers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 style="text-align: justify;"&gt;Mendel and the First Principles of Genetics&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;Mendel was not the first person to study how features were passed between generations, however, he was the first to take a careful and quantitative look at the situation. In doing so, he made a number of inferences that continue to have a profound influence on how we think about the transmission of information between generations. He didn&amp;#39;t know about DNA, genes, or chromosomes, but his insightful studies laid the groundwork for their discovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;Mendel quantitatively analyzed how specific traits behaved between generations and concluded that all offspring have two factors for a given character: one was received from the father and one was received from the mother. For a given character (e.g., flower color), one trait was always expressed (i.e., purple was dominant), whereas the other trait might recede between generations (i.e., white was recessive). In other words, recessive traits are only expressed if the two factors are the same (in the &lt;strong&gt;homozygous&lt;/strong&gt; state), whereas a dominant trait will be expressed even if only one factor is present (in the &lt;strong&gt;heterozygous&lt;/strong&gt; state).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 style="text-align: ;"&gt;&lt;object align="" data="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2092734" height="480" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="640"&gt;&lt;param name="quality" value="high" /&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2092734" /&gt;&lt;param name="wmode" value="transparent" /&gt;&lt;embed height="480" hspace="10" quality="high" src="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2092734" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" vspace="10" width="640" wmode="transparent"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;Mendel proposed that the discrete units for a given character would segregate away from one another during gamete production (e.g., individuals that were heterozygous with purple flowers could produce gametes with either a white or purple factor, but not both). This is often referred to as the Law of Segregation. Mendel looked at seven different characters and found that each character behaved independent of the other. He concluded that the factors associated with different characters assorted independently (in a random fashion) from one another. This is often referred to as the Law of Independent Assortment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;It has been almost 150 years since Mendel made his observations and inferences. In the years since, geneticists have validated his basic conclusions and we now know they describe the first principles of genetics. While we now refer to &quot;factors&quot; as genes, Mendel was the first to predict their presence and behavior between generations. His basic conclusions are as correct today as they were when he first proposed them, and his work spurred the work of thousands of geneticists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 style="text-align: justify;"&gt;Modern Mendelian Genetics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;Traits with simple dominant/recessive expression patterns, such as those examined in the previous exercise, are called &lt;strong&gt;Mendelian traits&lt;/strong&gt;. Mendelian traits are found in humans, and include attached versus unattached earlobes, mid-digital hair, bent thumbs, and a few other traits. These traits are useful for understanding the basic principles of genetics, but as you will learn in other genetics tutorials, very few traits are actually inherited in this simple manner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 style="text-align: justify;"&gt;Summary&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;Mankind has been aware of life cycles for thousands of years. Over the millennia, plant breeders have used variations in crop plants to select for improved varieties without really understanding the basic first principles of genetics. They simply crossed individuals that had the most favorable traits. The science of modern genetics is rooted in the work of Gregor Mendel, who was the first to carefully document the behavior of traits between successive generations. Mendel did not know about chromosomes, yet his observations predicted their presence. His careful analyses of monohybrid crosses allowed him to deduce that traits may skip a generation, depending on whether or not they are recessive (i.e., heterozygous recessive alleles are not expressed). In other words, he was able to infer the genetic composition (the genotype) by carefully observing the pattern of the observed character traits (the phenotypes) between successive generations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;We now know that the reason for the particular pattern of phenotypic expression in the F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; generation is because of the behavior of chromosomes during meiosis in the F&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; generation. Be sure that you understand how the segregation of chromosomes in meiosis provides a mechanism to account for the segregation frequencies observed in the F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;Keep in mind, Mendel did his work around the time of the American Civil War.&amp;nbsp; For a vivid historical perspective, imagine Mendel tending his garden in Brno (now in the Czech Republic), while across the Atlantic the armies of the North and South were engaged in a very different activity. Since the work of Mendel, we have learned a good deal about genetics. Not only do we understand why Mendel observed the frequencies that he did in the different generations, the molecular events that relate the genotype directly to the phenotype are also understood.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

&lt;h1 style="text-align: justify;"&gt;Introduction and Goals&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;This tutorial will teach you how to predict the segregation of alleles in parents that are heterozygous for different characters. Initially you will work with a tool referred to as a Punnett square, but later you will see how deriving probabilities can help you make the same predictions in a much easier manner. By the end of this tutorial you should have a working understanding of:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 style="text-align: justify;"&gt;Monohybrid Crosses&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: justify;"&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;monohybrid cross&lt;/strong&gt; involves the crossing of individuals and the examination of a single character (flower color or seed color or pod shape, etc.) in their offspring. The &lt;strong&gt;Punnett square&lt;/strong&gt; is a useful tool for predicting the genotypes and phenotypes of offspring in a genetic cross involving Mendelian traits. Constructing a Punnett square is quite easy, as demonstrated by the Web sites below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h1 style="text-align: justify;"&gt;Interpreting the Results of a Punnett Square&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;The key to understanding Punnett squares is in realizing that the expected types of offspring are probabilities. The Punnett square is useful because it calculates the probability of producing each of the genotypes or phenotypes for any one offspring. Let&amp;#39;s look at an example. A self-pollination of F1 hybrids for flower color (&lt;em&gt;Pp&lt;/em&gt;) gives a 3:1 ratio of purple:white flowers in t&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;he offspring. This means that 75% of the offspring are predicted to have purple flowers and 25% white flowers. It also means that for every offspring produced, that offspring has a 75% chance of having purple flowers and a 25% chance of having white flowers. Therefore, one would expect the number of offspring with a particular trait to be equal to the probability multiplied by &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;, the number of offspring. As you learned in the last tutorial when working with ratios, if you are given the ratio and the total number of offspring counted, you can convert the ratio to a probability and predict the number of offspring with each trait.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Test Crosses&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: justify;"&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;test cross&lt;/strong&gt; is used to determine the genotype of an individual with a dominant trait. Because the trait is dominant, an individual exhibiting the trait could be homozygous or heterozygous for the trait. (This cannot be determined by simply looking at the phenotype of the individual.) In a test cross, an individual with the dominant phenotype is crossed with a fully recessive individual. As shown in this figure, there are two possible outcomes (depending on the genotype of the parent). By examining the offspring of the cross, the unknown genotype of the dominant parent can be determined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h1 style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;Constructing a Punnett square for a &lt;strong&gt;dihybrid cross&lt;/strong&gt; is similar to the method used for a monohybrid cross. Determine the alleles produced by each parent, draw the Punnett square, and then combine the gametes for each cell. The following Web sites should help to demonstrate the process more clearly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 style="text-align: justify;"&gt;Meiosis: The Mechanism for Segregation of Alleles&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h1 style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;Recall from the &lt;a class="ext" href="https://onlinecourses.science.psu.edu/bio110/node/30" target="_blank" title="Tutorial 2 - Heredity and Life Cycles"&gt;Heredity and Life Cycles Tutorial&lt;/a&gt;, that homologous chromosomes pair during prophase 1 of meiosis, and later, each member of the pair will be packaged into separate gametes. Therefore, alleles on homologous chromosomes will segregate during meiosis I (&lt;strong&gt;The Law of Segregation&lt;/strong&gt;), and if the genes for different characters reside on different chromosomes (or are far apart on the same chromosome), they will independently assort during meiosis as well (&lt;strong&gt;The Law of Independent Assortment&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;object align="" data="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2093171" height="480" hspace="10" style="width: 640px; height: 480px;" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" vspace="10" width="640"&gt;&lt;param name="quality" value="high" /&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2093171" /&gt;&lt;param name="data" value="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2093171" /&gt;&lt;param name="wmode" value="transparent" /&gt;&lt;param name="src" value="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2093171" /&gt;&lt;param name="align" value="left" /&gt;&lt;param name="vspace" value="10" /&gt;&lt;param name="hspace" value="10" /&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;As the connection between genes and chromosomes started to become more clear in the years after Mendel&amp;#39;s death, scientists noted what seemed to be a paradox in Mendel&amp;#39;s Law of Independent Assortment and the behavior of chromosomes during gamete formation. Complex organisms must have huge numbers of genes to govern their biochemical processes, and yet, the number of chromosomes in these organisms is often small. For example, humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes, whereas pea plants have 7 pairs. Therefore, one must conclude that each chromosome houses many genes. But if there are many genes on each chromosome, how can two genes on the same chromosome independently assort from one another? The chromosome doesn&amp;#39;t break apart during meiosis; therefore, there must be another explanation. The answer is that some genes are physically linked to one another by residing on the same chromosome, but they appear to independently assort because they frequently recombine (exchange genetic material) with one another. The frequency with which they do this enables scientists to &quot;map&quot; gene locations on chromosomes. We will examine recombination in greater detail in upcoming exercises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="480" src="http://c.gigcount.com/wildfire/IMP/CXNID=2000002.0NXC/bT*xJmx*PTEzMDcxNTgwODA4OTkmcHQ9MTMwNzE1ODA4MzUzNiZwPTIwNjQyMSZkPWIyMDkzMTcxJmc9MiZvPTk2NjhhNGRlZDA4/NDRmNzlhYTY1ZTI4N2RlOTA2Y2E4Jm9mPTA=.gif" style="visibility: hidden; width: 0px; height: 0px;" width="640" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 style="text-align: justify;"&gt;Using Probability&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;Since the alleles for different characters assort randomly from one another, probability can be used to mathematically predict the outcomes of genetic crosses involving one or more characters. Although Punnett squares are an effective and straightforward way to examine simple genetic crosses, they are unwieldy and time consuming when the inheritance of multiple characters is examined. A more effective way to examine inheritance is to use two basic laws of probability (The Rule of Multiplication and The Rule of Addition) to determine the probabilities mathematically. A little background on probability will aid in your understanding. Probability scales range from 0 to 1. An event that is certain to occur has a value of 1, whereas an event that is certain not to occur has a value of 0. When you flip a coin, the probability of getting heads is 1/2 or 0.50, and the probability for getting tails is also 1/2 or 0.50. If you are rolling a single die, the probability of rolling a 1 is 1/6 or 0.17, as is the probability of rolling any other number on the die.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;If the outcome of a probability event is unaffected by what has happened in previous trials, it is an independent event. When you roll a die, the chance of rolling a 1 is always 1/6, regardless of what you rolled previously. A lottery drawing, on the other hand, is an example of a non-independent event. If balls numbered 1 through 36 are placed in the lottery machine and mixed, the odds of getting any of the numbers is 1/36 on the first number drawn. However, on the second number, the odds decline to 1/35 because the removal of the first ball has affected the odds on the second number. For our purposes, we will be working almost entirely with independent events; however, it is important to understand the distinction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 style="text-align: justify;"&gt;Rule of Multiplication&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;This figure shows the role of probability when estimating offspring genotypes in Mendelian genetics. The chance of getting a particular offspring requires two independent events to occur: the segregation of alleles into ova, and the segregation of alleles into sperm. In this example, each of the parents is heterozygous for flower color (&lt;em&gt;Pp&lt;/em&gt;); because the two alleles in each individual segregate randomly during meiosis, the chance of getting either a &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; allele in an ova or sperm is 50%. To form an offspring with a particular genotype, the appropriate gametes must come together. The probability of this happening is determined by multiplying the probabilities of the two independent events that must occur to give the desired outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;In the example given, the chance of getting a homozygous dominant offspring (&lt;em&gt;PP&lt;/em&gt;) would be equal to the chance of getting a &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; allele in the ova (50%) multiplied by the chance of getting a &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; allele in the sperm (50%). Much like flipping two coins in the hope of both coming up heads, the probability of getting an offspring of this genotype would be (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4. The same would be true of an offspring with a &lt;em&gt;pp&lt;/em&gt; genotype, as the probability of getting two &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; alleles would also be (1/2) (1/2) = 1/4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;These examples demonstrate the &lt;strong&gt;Rule of Multiplication&lt;/strong&gt;, which allows one to calculate the probability of two or more independent events occurring together in a specific combination. To determine the probability of an event occurring, determine the individual probabilities of each independent event, then multiply the individual probabilities to obtain the probability of these events occurring together. Some non-genetic examples should help to clarify this concept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;(a) What is the probability of getting heads three times in a row when flipping a coin?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;Probability of getting heads on one flip = 1/2&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;Probability of getting heads on three consecutive flips = (1/2) (1/2)(1/2) = 1/8&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;(b) What is the probability of rolling a six on two consecutive rolls of a die?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;Probability of getting a six on one roll = 1/6&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;Probability of getting a six on two consecutive rolls = (1/6)(1/6) = 1/36&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h1 style="text-align: justify;"&gt;Rule of Addition&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;The Rule of Multiplication works well when there is only one way to arrive at a particular outcome, but what if the outcome can occur in different ways? For example, what is the probability of getting an offspring with the genotype &lt;em&gt;Pp&lt;/em&gt; in the cross shown in this figure? Notice that there are two ways to get this genotype: a &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; from the ova and a &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; from the sperm, and vice versa. To calculate this probability, use the &lt;strong&gt;Rule of Addition&lt;/strong&gt;. This rule states that if an event can occur in more than one way, the probability of that event occurring is equal to the sum of the probabilities of each way the event can occur. As depicted here, the probability of getting an offspring with the genotype &lt;em&gt;Pp&lt;/em&gt; is equal to the probability of getting &lt;em&gt;Pp&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; from the ova, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; from the sperm) plus the probability of getting &lt;em&gt;pP&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; from the ova, &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; from the sperm). Therefore, the probability would be 1/4 + 1/4 = 2/4 = 1/2. This example demonstrates how both the Rule of Multiplication and the Rule of Addition can be used to predict the outcome of genetic crosses. To ensure that you understand the Rule of Addition, here is a non-genetic example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;object align="" data="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2093807" height="480" hspace="10" style="width: 640px; height: 480px;" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" vspace="10" width="640"&gt;&lt;param name="quality" value="high" /&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2093807" /&gt;&lt;param name="data" value="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2093807" /&gt;&lt;param name="wmode" value="transparent" /&gt;&lt;param name="src" value="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2093807" /&gt;&lt;param name="align" value="right" /&gt;&lt;param name="vspace" value="10" /&gt;&lt;param name="hspace" value="10" /&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;What is the probability of getting heads, at least once, in two flips of a coin? There are three possible ways to do this: heads on both flips, heads on the first flip, or heads on the second flip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;(a) Use the Rule of Multiplication to calculate the probabilities of each event that satisfies the conditions of the question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;Probability of getting heads on first flip, heads on second flip = (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;Probability of getting heads on first flip, tails on second flip = (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;Probability of getting tails on first flip, heads on second flip = (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;(b) Use the Rule of Addition to calculate the overall probability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;Probability of getting heads, at least once, in two flips of a coin = 1/4 (heads on the first flip, tails second) + 1/4 (tails first, heads second) + 1/4 (heads both times) = 3/4&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Summary&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;The phenotype of an organism arises from the complex interactions of many character traits. In a dihybrid cross two character traits can segregate in several ways, with each leading to a different phenotype. How can one predict the likelihood of the different phenotypes from a dihybrid cross? This becomes relatively straightforward, providing each character trait behaves in a Mendelian fashion; that is, a simple dominant-recessive expression pattern. If the character traits are located on different chromosomes, they will segregate independently from each other. This means that the separate probabilities of each character trait can be predicted, as with a monohybrid cross. It follows then that the probabilities of these different phenotypes occurring simultaneously in the same plant will be the product of their probabilities occurring alone. In other words, if a purple/round seeded plant that is heterozygous for both characters is crossed with itself (&quot;selfing&quot;), then the probability of observing round/seeded progeny will be 0.75 x 0.75 = 0.56. Be sure that you understand the logic behind this prediction and how it was calculated. Also, if there are more than two ways a given genotype can arise, then the probability is the sum of each way it can arise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;Relatively few character traits are inherited in a simple Mendelian manner. There are a number of other basic patterns of inheritance that have been described, including incomplete dominance, codominance, multiple alleles, pleiotropy, epistasis and polygenic inheritance. These will be discussed in &lt;a class="ext" href="https://onlinecourses.science.psu.edu/bio110/node/43" target="_blank" title="The Complex Expression Patterns of Multiple="&gt;The Complex Expression Patterns of Multiple Alleles&lt;/a&gt; tutorial.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

&lt;h1&gt;Introductions and Goals&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mendel was able to carry out his work in an interpretable manner because he took careful notes, made accurate counts, and chose traits that exhibited a clear dominant or recessive expression pattern. In fact, alleles that show simple dominant or recessive expression patterns are sometimes called &quot;Mendelian traits.&quot; Few alleles, however, behave in such a simple Mendelian manner. This tutorial will explore more complex patterns of expression. By the end of this tutorial you should have a basic understanding of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Genes with multiple alleles&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The distinction between the three types of dominance&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;How genes can have multiple effects&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;How genes can affect the expression of other genes&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Why some characters are controlled by more than one gene&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Incomplete Dominance&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="lightbox lightbox-processed"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 1. Incomplete Dominance" class="lightbox" src="assets/Tutorial5_Figure%201%20Incomplete%20Dominance.jpg" style="width: 400px; height: 434px; margin: 10px;" title="Figure 1. Incomplete Dominance" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Mendel&amp;#39;s experiments, offspring always looked like one of their two parents due to the &lt;strong&gt;complete dominance&lt;/strong&gt; of one allele over the other. This is not always the case because some genes display &lt;strong&gt;incomplete dominance&lt;/strong&gt;; that is, individuals with heterozygous alleles exhibit a phenotype intermediate between those with homozygous alleles. For example, this figure depicts the outcome of a cross between a snapdragon with red flowers and one with white flowers - the F&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; hybrids have pink flowers. In this case neither of the alleles for flower color are completely dominant over the other.&amp;nbsp; Therefore, individuals with heterozygous alleles have a phenotype unlike those with either set of homozygous alleles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As demonstrated in this figure, the Punnett square for this cross is like that for any other monohybrid cross. However, the ratio of phenotypes in the F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; generation is not 3:1 (dominant:recessive), as seen with completely dominant alleles, but rather a 1:2:1 ratio of red:pink:white flowers. In this example the alleles are symbolized differently than in the previous examples. Since neither allele dominates over the other, the use of an uppercase and lowercase version of the same letter is inappropriate. In this example the character (flower color) is indicated by a letter (&lt;em&gt;C&lt;/em&gt;), and the alleles encoding the trait (white, blue or red) are listed as uppercase subscripts (recall, they are both uppercase because neither is dominant to the other). You may see other symbolic representations for incomplete dominance, but don&amp;#39;t let this confuse you. The important thing to know is that some genes are expressed in an incomplete dominant manner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Codominance&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have examined complete dominance, in which one allele is clearly dominant over the other, and incomplete dominance, in which neither allele dominates over the other. In a third type of dominance, &lt;strong&gt;codominance&lt;/strong&gt;, both alleles are expressed in the phenotype of individuals that have heterozygous alleles. The human &lt;strong&gt;blood groups&lt;/strong&gt; designated M, N, and MN are examples of codominance. These groups are distinguished by the presence of two specific proteins on the surface of red blood cells, such as those shown in this figure. Group M individuals have one of the two proteins, group N have the other protein, and group MN have both proteins. In the latter case, the heterozygous situation does not result in an intermediate phenotype; instead, the M and N phenotypes are both expressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="lightbox lightbox-processed"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 2. MN Blood Groups" class="lightbox" src="assets/Tutorial5_Figure%202%20MN%20Blood%20Groups.jpg" style="width: 400px; height: 289px; margin: 10px;" title="Figure 2. MN Blood Groups" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The Three Types of Dominance&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Distinguishing between the three types of dominance is sometimes difficult, however, a little review should help clarify things. Think of complete dominance, incomplete dominance, and codominance as a continuum. At one end is complete dominance, in which the phenotype for only one of the two alleles is expressed in individuals that are heterozygous for the alleles. At the other end is codominance, in which both alleles are equally expressed in individuals that are heterozygous for the alleles. In between there are various levels of incomplete dominance, in which individuals that are heterozygous for the alleles display an intermediate phenotype. The key to understanding the difference between the three types is to look at the phenotype of the individuals with heterozygous alleles, then classify the relationship accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Multiple Alleles&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far we have only examined traits controlled by two alleles. This is easy to visualize because diploid organisms can only possess two alleles. Within a population, however, more than two alleles can exist (although any given individual only has two alleles).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;object align="" data="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2094011" height="480" hspace="10" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" vspace="10" width="640"&gt;&lt;param name="quality" value="high" /&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2094011" /&gt;&lt;param name="wmode" value="transparent" /&gt;&lt;param name="src" value="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2094011" /&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The human ABO blood groups are an example of &lt;strong&gt;multiple alleles&lt;/strong&gt;, and the relationship between phenotype and genotype is depicted in the figure above. There are four possible phenotypic blood types for this particular gene: A, B, AB, and O. The letters refer to two specific carbohydrate molecules on the surface of red blood cells. (Note, these are not the same molecules as the MN blood groups.) Individuals can have the A carbohydrate (blood type A), the B carbohydrate (blood type B), both the A and B carbohydrates (blood type AB), or neither carbohydrate (blood type O).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 3. AB Antigens" src="assets/Tutorial5_Figure%203%20AB%20Antigens.jpg" style="height: 173px; width: 400px;" title="Figure 3. AB Antigens" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	The ABO blood groups are formed by various combinations of three different alleles; I&lt;sup&gt;A&lt;/sup&gt; (codes for carbohydrate A), I&lt;sup&gt;B&lt;/sup&gt; (codes for carbohydrate B), and &lt;em&gt;i&lt;/em&gt; (codes for the lack of any carbohydrate). As shown in this figure, individuals with one or two I&lt;sup&gt;A&lt;/sup&gt; alleles will have blood type A, those with one or two I&lt;sup&gt;B&lt;/sup&gt; alleles will have blood type B, those with both the I&lt;sup&gt;A&lt;/sup&gt; and I&lt;sup&gt;B&lt;/sup&gt; alleles will have blood type AB, and those with the genotype &lt;em&gt;ii&lt;/em&gt; will have blood type O.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 4. ABO Blood Groups" src="assets/Tutorial5_Figure%204%20ABO%20Blood%20Groups.jpg" title="Figure 4. ABO Blood Groups" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Punnett square can be used to predict the genotype frequencies resulting from multiple allele crosses. However, one cannot be certain of an individual&amp;#39;s genotype if they are blood type A or B because there are two possible genotypes for each of these blood types. Therefore, many cross problems that examine blood types are similar to test crosses; that is, the parental genotype is uncertain. A few examples will aid in your understanding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Pleiotropy&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far we have only considered genes that affect a single phenotypic character. This actually is a rare situation because it is more common that one gene can have multiple effects (&lt;strong&gt;pleiotropy&lt;/strong&gt;). For example, albino individuals lack pigment in their skin and hair, and also have crossed eyes at a higher frequency than pigmented individuals (&lt;em&gt;see photograph&lt;/em&gt;). This occurs because the gene that causes albinism can also cause defects in the nerve connections between the eyes and the brain. These two traits are not always linked, again showing the complexity of genetic interactions in determining phenotypes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="lightbox lightbox-processed"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 5. Pleiotropy Albinism" class="lightbox" src="assets/Tutorial5_Figure%205%20Pleiotropy%20Albinism.jpg" style="width: 416px; height: 303px; margin: 10px;" title="Figure 5. Pleiotropy Albinism" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mendel also recognized this effect. He observed that pea plants with red flowers had red coloration where the leaf joined the stem, but that their seed coats were gray in color. Plants with white flowers had no coloration at the leaf-stem juncture and displayed white seed coats. These combinations were always found together, leading Mendel to conclude that they were likely controlled by the same hereditary unit (i.e., gene).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Epistasis&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes a gene at one location on a chromosome can affect the expression of a gene at a second location (&lt;strong&gt;epistasis&lt;/strong&gt;). A good example of epistasis is the genetic interactions that produce coat color in horses and other mammals. In horses, brown coat color (&lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt;) is dominant over tan (&lt;em&gt;b&lt;/em&gt;). Gene expression is dependent on a second gene that controls the deposition of pigment in hair. The dominant gene (&lt;em&gt;C&lt;/em&gt;) codes for the presence of pigment in hair, whereas the recessive gene (&lt;em&gt;c&lt;/em&gt;) codes for the absence of pigment. If a horse is homozygous recessive for the second gene (&lt;em&gt;cc&lt;/em&gt;), it will have a white coat regardless of the genetically programmed coat color (B gene) because pigment is not deposited in the hair. The figure above demonstrates this scenario. Several of the white horses have genotypes for brown or tan coat color in the first gene, but are completely white because they are homozygous recessive for the gene controlling pigment deposition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="lightbox lightbox-processed"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 6. Epistasis" class="lightbox" src="assets/Tutorial5_Figure%206%20Epistasis.jpg" style="width: 385px; height: 445px; margin: 10px;" title="Figure 6. Epistasis" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Polygenic Inheritance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The characters that Mendel studied are sometimes referred to as discrete characters because they can only be classified on an &quot;either-or&quot; basis (e.g., purple or white flowers, green or yellow seeds). Many characters cannot be classified in this manner because they vary in a population across a continuum (gradient). For example, the figure above illustrates that skin color in humans is a &lt;strong&gt;quantitative character&lt;/strong&gt;. Quantitative characters usually indicate that the character is controlled by more than one gene (&lt;strong&gt;polygenic inheritance&lt;/strong&gt;). &lt;span class="lightbox lightbox-processed"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 7. Polygenic Inheritance " class="lightbox" src="assets/Tutorial5_Figure%207%20Polygenic%20Inheritance.jpg" style="width: 360px; height: 450px; margin: 10px;" title="Figure 7. Polygenic Inheritance" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the example shown, a simplification of the genetics of skin color in humans shows that three genes interact to determine the level of pigment in an individual&amp;#39;s skin. The dominant alleles (&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;C&lt;/em&gt;) each contribute one &quot;unit&quot; of pigment to the individual, and their effects are cumulative such that individuals with more of these alleles will be darker than those with fewer alleles. The recessive alleles (&lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;b&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;c&lt;/em&gt;) do not contribute any units of pigment. Therefore, skin color is related to the number of dominant alleles present in each individual&amp;#39;s genotype. A cross of two completely heterozygous parents produces seven phenotypes in their offspring, ranging from very light to very dark skin. The distribution of skin color in the offspring would resemble a bell-shaped curve because there would be more individuals with intermediate skin colors than either extreme. As the number of genes involved increases, the differences between the various genotypes become more subtle and the distribution fits the curve more closely. Other examples of polygenic inheritance in humans include height, hair color, and eye color. This helps to explain the slight variations in these characters that we see in different individuals.&lt;img border="0" height="0" src="http://c.gigcount.com/wildfire/IMP/CXNID=2000002.0NXC/bT*xJmx*PTEzMDcxNTg5Njg*ODYmcHQ9MTMwNzE1ODk3MDY4NCZwPTIwNjQyMSZkPWIyMDk*MTYwJmc9MiZvPTk2NjhhNGRlZDA4/NDRmNzlhYTY1ZTI4N2RlOTA2Y2E4Jm9mPTA=.gif" style="visibility: hidden; width: 0px; height: 0px;" width="0" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Summary&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tutorial explored the more complex expression patterns of alleles. These patterns of expression do not contradict the ideas and conclusions of Mendel, rather they reveal that genes and their products can interact and/or be expressed in complex ways. In all cases, these genes are still transmitted from generation to generation on chromosomes that segregate independently during meiosis. The differences lie in how the gene product behaves within the cell, and the number of such products that contribute to a given character trait.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some alleles can show incomplete dominance. In the snapdragon flower color and snake body color examples, we saw that three phenotypes could be traced to two alleles. In other words, two separate homozygous phenotypes resulted (as is usually seen with characters transmitted in a Mendelian manner) and a third phenotype associated with a heterozygous genotype (clearly different than the case observed with Mendelian traits, where the heterozygous phenotype is the same as the homozygous dominant genotype). How can two alleles yield three phenotypes? Consider the snapdragon. When a plant receives two alleles (a double dose) of the red allele, the flower is very red. These alleles encode for enzymes involved in the production of red pigment. The alternative alleles produce an enzyme that is nonfunctional and cannot participate in pigment synthesis. When a plant receives two copies of this nonfunctional alternative allele, pigment is not produced and the flower is white. When the plant receives one copy (a single dose) of the functional red allele, it can produce some pigment, but not as much as with two fully functional alleles, and so, the color is less red (pink).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the example above, note that the reason for the phenotypic pattern was that one allele was nonfunctional and the other functional allele resulted in a phenotype that was dependent on there being one or two copies of the functional alleles. There is another situation, however, termed codominance, in which both alleles are functional and expressed. The M and N blood groups are examples of codominance. These alleles encode for proteins that are located on the surface of red blood cells. They are similar but nonidentical; that is, they differ in four amino acids. If the individual is homozygous, then the phenotype is either M or N. If heterozygous, however, then both are expressed on the surface of red blood cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far we have considered fairly simple cases, where the number of alleles is limited to two. In fact, many genes have multiple alleles. This may seem impossible because in the diploid state there is only room for two alleles (one on the maternal chromosome and one on the paternal chromosome) of a gene. At the population level, however, many more allele forms are possible (although in any given diploid individual, only two occur at any given time). The ABO blood type is one example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some cases, genes and their alleles may be expressed in complex ways. That is, no single trait can be attributed to a given allele. Pleiotropy describes this situation, and includes the examples of pigmentation and crossed eyes in the case of albinism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case where one gene product is used by (or dependent on) another product, epistasis can occur. This is fairly common because gene products do not function in isolation. In the example of fur color in mice, one can see that pigment synthesis and pigment deposition are two processes that must occur in order for a specific phenotype (i.e., color) to be observed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, we considered the case of polygenic inheritance, whereby many genes and their alleles are involved in the expression of a given phenotype. If you think about it, you will likely recognize that polygenic inheritance and epistasis are related. In fact, many traits are determined by multiple genes, which makes the analysis of expression patterns complex.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

&lt;h2&gt;Introduction and Goals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="lightbox"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 1. Gregor Mendel" class="lightbox" src="assets/Tutorial7_Figure%201%20Mendel.jpg" style="height: 340px; margin: 10px; width: 270px;" title="Figure 1. Gregor Mendel" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mendel concluded from his experiments that &quot;hereditary units&quot; transmitted traits from one generation to the next, but at the time of his work (1850-1860&amp;#39;s) chromosomes had not yet been observed. Around the turn of the century, two events firmly placed Mendel&amp;#39;s name in history. First, three botanists independently rediscovered Mendel&amp;#39;s research after conducting studies similar to his. Second, scientists began to notice similarities between the behavior of chromosomes (only recently observed) during mitosis and meiosis. For example, they saw that organisms had pairs of homologous chromosomes that separated during meiosis, and that the fusion of two gametes resulted in a zygote with the normal diploid number of chromosomes. These facts meshed well with Mendel&amp;#39;s Laws of Segregation and Independent Assortment, demonstrating that chromosomes contained the &quot;hereditary units&quot; proposed by Mendel. Mendel&amp;#39;s work and the discovery of chromosomes and their behavior laid the groundwork for studies which revealed that genes are found in specific locations on chromosomes, and that homologous chromosomes segregate and nonhomologous chromosomes independently assort during meiosis. This tutorial will more closely examine the role that chromosomes play in allele segregation. You will learn that genes (and their alleles) on different chromosomes segregate independently; if they are on the same chromosome, however, they may or may not exhibit independent segregation. By the end of this tutorial you should have a basic understanding of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;How chromosome behavior explains allele segregation&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Gender determination in humans and other organisms&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Inheritance of other sex-linked genes&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Role of X-inactivation in gene expression&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Relationship Between Chromosome Behavior and Mendel&amp;#39;s Laws&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="lightbox"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 2. Chromosome basis of Mendel's laws" class="lightbox" src="assets/Tutorial7_Figure%202%20Chr%20basis%20of%20Mendels%20laws.jpg" style="height: 243px; margin: 10px; width: 300px;" title="Figure 2. Chromosome basis of Mendel's laws" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This figure demonstrates the relationship between Mendel&amp;#39;s work and the behavior of chromosomes during meiosis. It shows how a dihybrid individual has two different alleles for each gene: seed color and shape (indicated by lines on the chromosomes).&amp;nbsp; Each gene is located on one member of the homologous pair. The random assortment of the homologous pairs in meiosis I results in different combinations of alleles in the gametes. Upon fertilization, these four different gametes will lead to the characteristic 9:3:3:1 ratio observed by Mendel in his dihybrid crosses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Linking Genes and Chromosomes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="lightbox"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 3. Thomas Hunt Morgan from the 1891 Johns Hopkins yearbook of 1891" class="lightbox" src="assets/Tutorial7_Figure%203%20Thomas_Hunt_Morgan.jpg" style="height: 415px; margin: 10px; width: 270px;" title="Figure 3. Thomas Hunt Morgan from the 1891 Johns Hopkins yearbook of 1891" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the relationship between genes and traits was fairly well accepted by the early 1900&amp;#39;s, biologist T. H. Morgan of Columbia University first mapped a gene to a specific chromosome. One of the early pioneers working with fruit flies in genetic studies, Morgan (and his students) discovered one male fly with white eyes (which was unlike any fly he had seen before). The normal or most abundant (&lt;strong&gt;wild-type&lt;/strong&gt;) phenotype for this character is red eyes, so the individual had a &lt;strong&gt;mutant phenotype&lt;/strong&gt; for this particular character.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Nomenclature Used by &lt;em&gt;Drosophila&lt;/em&gt; Geneticists&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To assist with his work, Morgan and his students developed a nomenclature system for distinguishing between the normal (wild-type) allele and its variants. This system is still used by &lt;em&gt;Drosophila&lt;/em&gt; geneticists. The gene for a particular character is named for the first mutant phenotype discovered. In the case of eye color, the allele for white eyes was appropriately designated &lt;em&gt;w&lt;/em&gt;, for &quot;white.&quot; The wild-type allele uses the same letter but has a superscript&amp;nbsp;+ . Therefore, the allele for red eyes is symbolized as &lt;em&gt;w+&lt;/em&gt;. The white eye allele is then simply &lt;em&gt;w&lt;/em&gt;. The letter identifying the mutant is lowercase if the allele is recessive (as in white eyes), or uppercase for those mutations that are dominant to the wild-type allele. The allele that causes curly wings, a dominant mutation, is symbolized as &lt;em&gt;Cy&lt;/em&gt;, and the allele that codes for straight wings (wild type) is identified as &lt;em&gt;Cy+&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Sex-linked Genes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="lightbox"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 4. Sex-linked inheritance." class="lightbox" src="assets/Tutorial7_Figure%204%20Sex-linked%20Inheritance.jpg" style="height: 315px; margin: 10px; width: 270px;" title="Figure 4. Sex-linked inheritance." /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To investigate the mutant white eye allele, Morgan mated a mutant white-eyed male fly with a red-eyed (wild type) female. As shown in this figure, all of the F&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; offspring had red eyes, indicating that the allele for white eyes was recessive. When Morgan bred the F&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; generation flies to one another, he observed the classic 3:1 ratio of red:white eyes, however, only males demonstrated the mutant trait. All of the females and one-half of the males had the wild-type trait, which led Morgan to hypothesize that the gene that coded for eye color must be related to sex determination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like humans, female fruit flies have two &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; chromosomes (&lt;em&gt;XX&lt;/em&gt;) and males have one &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; and one &lt;em&gt;Y&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;XY&lt;/em&gt;). If the gene for eye color is located on the &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; chromosome, then this would explain why the trait rarely appears in females (i.e., each female has at least one copy of the dominant wild-type allele). However, males would show the mutant trait because they have only one &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; chromosome and there is no corresponding gene for eye color on the &lt;em&gt;Y&lt;/em&gt; chromosome. This study demonstrated that the gene for eye color in &lt;em&gt;D. melanogaster&lt;/em&gt; was located on the &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; chromosome and provided further evidence for a chromosome theory of heredity. The X and Y chromosomes are called &lt;strong&gt;sex chromosomes&lt;/strong&gt; because they determine the sex of an individual. Genes that are located on these chromosomes are called &lt;strong&gt;sex-linked genes&lt;/strong&gt;. All other chromosomes in a cell (i.e., other than the sex chromosomes) are referred to as &lt;strong&gt;autosomes&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there are several different systems for sex determination, for simplicity&amp;#39;s sake we will focus on the &lt;strong&gt;X-Y system&lt;/strong&gt; of sex determination to examine sex-linked inheritance. During meiosis, the two &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; chromosomes (found in females) or the &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Y&lt;/em&gt; chromosomes (found in males) pair together but undergo little crossing over. One of these chromosomes goes to each gamete, so females produce gametes with only &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; chromosomes, whereas males produce equal numbers of gametes with either an &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Y&lt;/em&gt; chromosome. If two gametes with &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; chromosomes undergo fertilization, the resultant offspring will be female (&lt;em&gt;XX&lt;/em&gt;). That is, if an ovum with an X chromosome and a sperm with an X chromosome combine, the resultant offspring will be female. However, if an ovum with an X chromosome and a sperm with a Y chromosome combine, the offspring will be male (&lt;em&gt;XY&lt;/em&gt;). While it has long been known that the &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; chromosome contains a substantial number of genes, researchers have only recently found genes on the &lt;em&gt;Y&lt;/em&gt; chromosome, most of which are associated with the development of male gonads. Therefore, it appears that a gene (or genes) on the &lt;em&gt;Y&lt;/em&gt; chromosome provides the biochemical signal that begins the development of male gonads in embryos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Sex-linked Inheritance&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only do sex chromosomes determine the sex of an individual, but the &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; chromosome also has genes that code for many characters. Sex-linked alleles follow the patterns of inheritance observed in Morgan&amp;#39;s studies, in which fathers transmit these genes to their daughters, and mothers can transmit them to either sons or daughters. Females will only express recessive sex-linked traits that are homozygous, but males will express the trait coded for by their one &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; chromosome. As a result, sex-linked recessive traits are far more frequent in males than in females, although some females do exhibit sex-linked recessive traits. Since males have only one chromosomal location for sex-linked genes, the terms homozygous and heterozygous have little meaning. By convention, males are said to be &lt;strong&gt;hemizygous&lt;/strong&gt; for sex-linked genes because they have half (&quot;hemi&quot;) as many alleles as a female.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="lightbox"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 5. The transmission of sex-linked recessive traits." class="lightbox" src="assets/Tutorial7_Figure%205%20Transmission%20of%20Sex-linked%20traits.jpg" style="height: 200px; margin: 10px; width: 404px;" title="Figure 5. The transmission of sex-linked recessive traits." /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with autosomal traits, you can utilize the Punnett square to study the transmission of sex-linked traits. When completing these crosses, the gametes identify the sex chromosomes only. The genes located on the &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; chromosome are indicated with superscript letters. (We will not examine any cases where we track a &lt;em&gt;Y&lt;/em&gt;-linked gene.) As with Mendelian traits, a lowercase letter indicates a recessive allele, whereas an uppercase letter indicates a dominant allele. When discussing sex-linked traits, carriers (females who are heterozygous for a recessive trait) need to be considered. This figure illustrates several examples of genetic crosses involving sex-linked traits. White boxes represent unaffected individuals, light-colored boxes represent carriers, and dark-colored boxes represent affected individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sex Determination in Other Organisms&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="lightbox"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 6. Some chromosomal systems of sex determination." class="lightbox" src="assets/Tutorial7_Figure%206%20Sex%20determination.jpg" style="height: 296px; margin: 10px; width: 300px;" title="Figure 6. Some chromosomal systems of sex determination." /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only did Morgan&amp;#39;s work bolster a chromosome theory of heredity, it also initiated the study of sex-linked traits. Although the basis of sex determination in humans and fruit flies is identical (&lt;em&gt;XX&lt;/em&gt; = female, &lt;em&gt;XY&lt;/em&gt; = male), the same is not true of all organisms. In this figure the numerals represent the number of autosomes. In some insects sex is determined by the &lt;strong&gt;X-O system&lt;/strong&gt;, in which females have two copies of the &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; chromosome and males only one. Therefore, the sex of the offspring will be determined by whether or not an &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; chromosome is present in the sperm that fertilizes the ovum. The &lt;strong&gt;Z-W system&lt;/strong&gt; occurs in some birds, insects, and fish. In this system the chromosomes found in the ovum are variable and sperm always contribute a &lt;em&gt;Z&lt;/em&gt; chromosome. Here, it is the female (not the male) that determines the sex of the offspring. Bees and ants display a fourth type of sex determination, the &lt;strong&gt;haplo-diploid system&lt;/strong&gt;. Females develop from fertilized eggs and are diploid, whereas males develop from unfertilized eggs and are haploid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genes in Humans - Color Blindness&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sex-linked traits are not unique to flies; a great many exist for humans. One example is color blindness, in which affected individuals are not able to distinguish certain colors. The gene for color blindness is X-linked and recessive; therefore, color blindness affects far more males than females. Color blindness is diagnosed by showing children images like the one on this page. The orange circle is visible to all, but individuals with red-green color blindness are unable to distinguish the red star from the green background.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sex-linked Genes in Humans - Hemophilia&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another sex-linked trait in humans is hemophilia. Hemophiliacs (individuals affected with hemophilia) lack a protein involved in blood clotting, hence they can bleed profusely from even a minor abrasion. This disease is of particular interest, given its relatively high frequency in many of the royal houses of Europe. It is thought that the hemophilia gene spontaneously mutated in one of Queen Victoria&amp;#39;s (England) parents, making her a carrier of the trait. She transmitted the hemophilia allele to one son and some of her daughters, and it eventually affected the imperial houses of Prussia, Russia, and Spain through a series of politically arranged marriages.

&lt;h3&gt;X-Inactivation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Females have two X chromosomes, whereas males have only one; and yet, males undergo normal development. How can this be? The answer lies in an observation that was made by the geneticist Mary Lyon. Female mammals have a dark region located just inside the nucleus, along the nuclear membrane. The object is called a &lt;strong&gt;Barr body&lt;/strong&gt;. The Barr body is an inactivated X chromosome that stays condensed throughout the cell cycle. By inactivated, it is meant that most of the genes on the chromosome are not expressed and cannot be used to make proteins. Therefore, like the cells in males, females have only one functioning X chromosome and they contribute only one dose (copy) of the genes on that chromosome. Inactivation of the X chromosome in females compensates for the extra copy, thereby making the production of proteins in the cells of males and females the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How is the X chromosome inactivated in female cells? It is a process that happens early in development, when one of the two X chromosomes in the cells of the embryo becomes inactivated. It appears to be a random process, with about 50% of the cells inactivating the maternal X and 50% inactivating the paternal X.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="lightbox"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 8. X-inactivation - A female calico cat." class="lightbox" src="assets/Tutorial7_Figure%208%20X-inactivation%20Calico%20Cat.jpg" style="height: 199px; margin: 10px; width: 300px;" title="Figure 8. X-inactivation - A female calico cat." /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results of inactivation are easily seen in calico cats. The gene for orange fur is on the X chromosome in cats. If a cat is heterozygous for the orange allele (O = orange, o = not orange), then random inactivation of the X chromosomes causes patches of orange and not orange (usually black) fur. This is why male calico cats are so rare. They must have an XXY chromosome complement. (This chromosome complement causes Klinefelter syndrome in humans.) In these males, one of the X chromosomes is inactivated and Barr bodies are found in their cells. Because of the presence of the Y chromosome, however, these individuals are genetically male.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gene for the inactivation of the X chromosome, called the &lt;strong&gt;XIST gene&lt;/strong&gt;, is located on the X chromosome. This gene does not appear to code for a protein. It is one of the few genes expressed on the inactivated X chromosome. The gene is transcribed, producing many copies of an RNA molecule. These RNAs attach to the DNA on the same X chromosome, inactivating it. Scientists are still researching the phenomenon. For example, it is uncertain how cells determine if an X chromosome should be inactivated or not. There is still a lot to learn about X-inactivation in mammals.&lt;img src="http://c.gigcount.com/wildfire/IMP/CXNID=2000002.0NXC/bT*xJmx*PTEzMDc3MjY*NzgyODcmcHQ9MTMwNzcyNjQ4MDU4MSZwPTIwNjQyMSZkPWIyMTAyNDIxJmc9MiZvPTk2NjhhNGRlZDA4/NDRmNzlhYTY1ZTI4N2RlOTA2Y2E4Jm9mPTA=.gif" style="height:0px; visibility:hidden; width:0px" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Summary&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous to this tutorial, we considered the expression pattern of genes that are found on different chromosomes (therefore, they independently assort). However, what is the behavior of genes that are located on the same chromosome? What happens to traits that are found on the sex chromosomes?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many sexually reproducing organisms, gender is determined by genes that are located on dissimilar chromosomes. These dissimilar chromosomes are termed sex chromosomes. Humans possess 23 pairs of chromosomes; 22 of these are similar (autosomes), whereas one pair (the X and Y chromosomes) is dissimilar and possesses the genes responsible for the transmission of the character traits that determine gender. If an individual has the XX genotype, the female character trait is expressed, whereas the XY genotype results in males. There are two important facts to remember about sex chromosomes. First, the X chromosome possesses more genes than the Y chromosome. Second, genes that affect traits other than gender are also found on these chromosomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the above two facts in mind, consider the male genotype (XY). Because the X chromosome has more genes than the Y, not all alleles will be found in the heterozygous state. That is, the maternally derived alleles may be expressed as if they were in the homozygous state. (Remember that the male&amp;#39;s X chromosome comes from the mother.) Traits that are disproportionately expressed in one gender (typically males) are termed sex-linked traits. That is, sex-linked traits tend to follow (are linked to) the gender from which they&amp;#39;re derived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, we will look more closely at the behavior of genes that are located on the same autosome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The relationship between gene segregation and meiosis is examined here. As you should now know, Mendel was able to observe independent assortment between different genes because they were located on different chromosomes (each of which assorts randomly during meiosis). We also mentioned that genes located on the same chromosome may co-segregate because they are linked. Next, you will learn why they may, or may not, co-segregate. Moreover, you will learn how the frequency at which they become unlinked can be used to construct a genetic map of each chromosome. By the end of this tutorial you should have a basic understanding of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Why genes are linked&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;What complete vs. incomplete linkage means&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;How genes recombine via crossing-over during prophase I&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;How crossover frequency can be used to map genes&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;How meiotic recombination and independent assortment contribute to genetic variation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Historical Background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="lightbox"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 1. A.H. Sturtevant relaxing at Woods Hole in 1916." class="lightbox" src="assets/Tutorial%208%20Figure%201%20A.%20H.%20Sturtevant.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 192px; margin: 10px;" title="Figure 1. A.H. Sturtevant relaxing at Woods Hole in 1916." /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While at Columbia University in 1909, a young undergraduate student (Alfred Henry Sturtevant) took a class from Dr. Thomas H. Morgan, the famous geneticist who first described the relationship between genes and chromosomes (see tutorial 7). Sturtevant decided to continue in this line of study, due to his life-long interest in genetics. Sturtevant&amp;#39;s interest had been fostered by his work on inheritance patterns of coat color in horses because he had spent his youth tabulating the pedigrees of his father&amp;#39;s horses and studying the passing of color traits across generations. Sturtevant approached the distinguished professor and asked for a research position in Morgan&amp;#39;s laboratory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="lightbox"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 2. A. H. Sturtevant." class="lightbox" src="assets/Tutorial%208%20Figure%202%20A.%20H.%20Sturtevant.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 278px; margin: 10px;" title="Figure 2. A. H. Sturtevant." /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intrigued by Sturtevant&amp;#39;s work on coat color inheritance (which he later encouraged Alfred to publish in the Biological Bulletin; c. 1910), Morgan offered Sturtevant a desk and research project, in what later became known as &quot;Morgan&amp;#39;s Fly Room.&quot; Morgan had recently begun working with a relatively new model system for genetic analysis, the fruit fly &lt;em&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/em&gt;. Together with Calvin Bridges and H.J. Muller, Sturtevant became a member of Morgan&amp;#39;s lab at a time when the focus of the lab was shifting away from the study of development and embryology in marine invertebrates to the genetics of &lt;em&gt;Drosophila&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="lightbox"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 3. A. H. Sturtevant" class="lightbox" src="assets/Tutorial%208%20Figure%203%20A.%20H.%20Sturtevant.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 329px; margin: 10px;" title="Figure 3. A. H. Sturtevant" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sturtevant was fascinated with his work in the &quot;Fly Room.&quot; Over the course of his undergraduate research he spent hours talking about inheritance with his colleagues. One night, after a lengthy discussion about a paper describing coat color inheritance in rabbits, Sturtevant deduced that genes were linked in a series. He was so energized about his idea that he stayed up late that evening constructing experiments that would later demonstrate his theory and provide the basis of linkage analysis. Sturtevant&amp;#39;s work (as well as that of his labmates) was a key component to the demonstration of the chromosome theory of heredity published by Morgan&amp;#39;s group. Sturtevant continued his research as a graduate student in the lab, where he published the first &lt;strong&gt;genetic map&lt;/strong&gt; of a chromosome as part of his graduate dissertation in 1913. Still, chromosome theory would not be definitively proven until after the Second World War.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Pairing at Prophase I&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chromosomes are linear pieces of DNA that are highly folded and compacted (&lt;a assets/tutorial-2-heredity-and-life-cycles." target="_blank" title="Tutorial 2 - Heredity and Life Cycles"&gt;DNA Packaging&lt;/a&gt;). If all of the DNA pieces from each of your 46 chromosomes (23 pairs) were linked end to end, the DNA would stretch about 2 meters. Therefore, DNA molecules are highly organized structures compacted into the nucleus of a single cell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="lightbox"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 4. DNA Structure" class="lightbox" src="assets/Tutorial%208%20Figure%204%20DNA%20structure.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 333px; margin: 10px;" title="Figure 4. DNA Structure" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DNA is a double-stranded molecule containing two antiparallel strands of nucleotides arranged in the form of a double helix. The two strands are held together by hydrogen bonds and contain nitrogenous bases (&lt;strong&gt;nucleotides&lt;/strong&gt;) paired in a complementary fashion that appear as &quot;rungs&quot; on a spiral ladder. The complementary nucleotides pair specifically, such that adenine and guanine nucleotides (A and G) pair with corresponding thymine and cytosine nucleotides (T and C), respectively; thus, A pairs with T, and G pairs with C. The figure shown here depicts this in two ways. The image on the left clearly shows the base-pairing rules, whereas the image on the right depicts the helical arrangement of the paired polynucleotide strands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Homologous chromosomes have similar but nonidentical nucleotide sequences. Indeed, it is these subtle differences in nucleotide sequences that form the molecular identify of every alternative allele for a given gene. During prophase I, homologous chromosomes associate and pair together due to their similarity in structure, length, and gene sequence. This sets up a physical association that facilitates the exchange of genetic sequences (i.e., pieces of DNA) between homologous chromosomes, in a process termed crossing over (previously discussed here --link to crossing over flash video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Crossing Over Between Homologous Chromosomes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="lightbox"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 5. Crossing-over" class="lightbox" src="assets/Tutorial%208%20Figure%205%20Crossing%20over.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 171px; margin: 10px;" title="Figure 5. Crossing-over" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pairing of homologous chromosomes at prophase I is different than the pairing that occurs between complementary strands of DNA. In a mechanism that is not completely understood, the DNA of nonsister chromatids becomes precisely aligned. When homologues pair, both a maternal copy and a paternal copy of genetic information line up against each other. The association is so intimate that the two homologues swap genetic material in a process called &lt;strong&gt;crossing over&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This process is a source of &lt;strong&gt;genetic recombination&lt;/strong&gt; and produces &lt;strong&gt;recombinant chromosomes&lt;/strong&gt;. That is, a piece of a maternal chromatid exchanges with a piece of the paternal chromatid on the nonsister chromatid. There can be multiple crossovers between nonsister chromatids. Furthermore, crossover configurations can occur in any combination and can lead to dramatically different outcomes. See crossing over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only two chromatids are involved in any single crossover, and crossing over occurs at different points along the chromosome. Every meiotic process does not involve crossing over in the same set of genes each time, but there is at least one crossover per homologous pair. Still, when crossing over is observed in a meiotic division, up to half of the products of that division result in a recombination of DNA between the homologues. This recombination means the homologues are now different than the parents&amp;#39; chromosomes, therefore, each may carry a different set of genetic information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Crossing Over is Random&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many factors affect crossing over, so the position on the chromosome where crossing over will occur is unpredictable. Crossing over is a random event based on chance. The location of the break points on the DNA sequence of the chromosomes are somewhat random, but the recombination frequency is relatively constant between homologous chromosomes. (For a given chromosome, N number of breaks will occur, but where they will occur is random.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;object align="" height="480" width="640"&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2106348" /&gt;&lt;param name="wmode" value="transparent" /&gt;&lt;embed align="" height="480" src="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2106348" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="640" wmode="transparent"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The probability of crossing over between genes on a chromosome is dependent on the distances between the genes. This shouldn&amp;#39;t surprise you because the greater the distance between two genes, the greater the chance a break will occur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genes that are located on the same chromosome and that tend to be inherited together are termed &lt;strong&gt;linked genes&lt;/strong&gt; because the DNA sequence containing the genes is passed along as a unit during meiosis. The closer that genes reside on a particular chromosome, the higher the probability that they will be inherited as a unit, since crossing over between two linked genes is not as common.&amp;nbsp; &lt;strong&gt;Completely linked&lt;/strong&gt; genes are genes that are so close together on a chromosome that crossing-over never occurs between them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Linked genes do not follow the expected inheritance patterns predicted by Mendel&amp;#39;s Theory of Independent Assortment when observed across several generations of crosses. Usually, crossing over between nonsister chromatids will occur between genes when they are relatively far apart on the homologous chromosomes when pairing occurs. This results in the production of an equal number of nonrecombinant and recombinant chromosomes. Thus, the ratio of offspring produced from test crosses will be 1:1:1:1 (fully paternal, paternal-maternal recombinant, maternal-paternal recombinant, and fully maternal). When half of all offspring have recombinant chromosomes, a 50% frequency of recombination is observed. Recall that in a test cross, a 1:1:1:1 ratio indicates that the genes are unlinked. Therefore, unlinked genes may either reside on different chromosomes or reside far apart on the same chromosome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When two genes are very close together on each homologue, break points for crossing over between the two genes will be rare and fewer recombinant chromosomes will be produced. Under this circumstance, a ratio that deviates from the usual 1:1:1:1 will be observed, indicating that the genes are linked. Thus, crossing over between two particular genes on the same chromosome can be used as an indirect indicator of the distance between the two genes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="0" src="https://c.gigcount.com/wildfire/IMP/CXNID=2000002.0NXC/bT*xJmx*PTEzMDc3OTY5NDYwODAmcHQ9MTMwNzc5NzExMTE5MiZwPTIwNjQyMSZkPWIyMTA2MzQ4Jmc9MiZvPTk2NjhhNGRlZDA4/NDRmNzlhYTY1ZTI4N2RlOTA2Y2E4Jm9mPTA=.gif" style="visibility: hidden; width: 0px; height: 0px;" width="0" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Evidence for Linked Genes in Drosophila&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="lightbox"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 6. Crossing over accounts for recombinant phenotypes." class="lightbox" src="assets/Tutorial%208%20Figure%206%20Crossing%20over%20and%20recombiinants.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 302px; margin: 10px;" title="Figure 6. Crossing over accounts for recombinant phenotypes." /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This figure demonstrates a test cross between flies differing in two characters: body color (&lt;em&gt;b&lt;/em&gt;) and wing size (&lt;em&gt;vg&lt;/em&gt;). The females are heterozygous for both genes and their phenotypes are wild type, so they display gray bodies and normal wings (&lt;em&gt;b+&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;b&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;vg+&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;vg&lt;/em&gt;). The males are homozygous recessive and express the mutant phenotypes for both characteristics, so they display black bodies and vestigial wings (&lt;em&gt;b&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;b&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;vg&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;vg&lt;/em&gt;). When T.H. Morgan scored this particular experiment and classified the offspring according to phenotype, he found that the parental phenotypes were disproportionately represented among offspring. If the two characters were on different chromosomes and assorted independently, Morgan would have expected to see a ratio of recombinant phenotypes to parental phenotypes of 1:1:1:1. Yet Morgan&amp;#39;s observation of disproportionate offspring led him to conclude that the genes for body color and wing size in &lt;em&gt;Drosophila&lt;/em&gt; were usually transmitted together from parents to offspring because they were located on the same chromosome. Therefore, the black body color gene and the vestigial wing gene are linked. This means that the genetic location for these genes are found close to one another and on the same chromosome.&lt;/p&gt;

You may recall having seen this problem previously when you learned about dihybrid crosses, but it is particularly applicable to the subject of this tutorial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Using Cross Over Frequencies to Map Genes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="lightbox"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 7. Calculating Recombination Frequencies." class="lightbox" src="assets/Tutorial%208%20Figure%207%20Recombinant%20Frequencies.jpg" style="width: 400px; height: 240px; margin: 10px;" title="Figure 7. Calculating Recombination Frequencies." /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alfred H. Sturtevant hypothesized that the frequency at which linked genes become unlinked (&lt;strong&gt;recombination frequencies&lt;/strong&gt;; calculated from experiments similar to the one in this figure) could be used to determine the distances between genes on a chromosome. He predicted that the farther apart two genes were on a particular chromosome, the higher the probability that crossing over would occur between them, and subsequently, a higher recombination frequency would be observed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;object align="" height="480" width="640"&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2106429" /&gt;&lt;param name="wmode" value="transparent" /&gt;&lt;embed align="" height="480" src="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2106429" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="640" wmode="transparent"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By considering a chromosome a linear sequence of genes, Sturtevant assigned each gene he was studying in fruit fly crosses a position on the chromosome using recombination frequencies. This figure illustrates one of Sturtevant&amp;#39;s genetic maps, where three genes that are linked to each other (body color (b), wing size (vg) and an eye color gene called cinnabar (cn)) are positioned based on recombination frequencies observed in test crosses. This type of genetic map is called a &lt;strong&gt;linkage map&lt;/strong&gt; because it portrays the sequence of genes along a chromosome, but it does not give the precise location of the genes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="lightbox"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 8. Genetic Map" class="lightbox" src="assets/Tutorial%208%20Figure%208%20Genetic%20Map.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 114px; margin: 10px;" title="Figure 8. Genetic Map" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To determine the distance between two genes, Sturtevant divided the number of gametes with recombinant chromosomes by the total number of gametes observed. In the figure above, the recombination frequency between cn and b is 9%, and the recombination frequency between cn and vg is 9.5%. Therefore, crossovers between cn and b, and between cn and vg, are about half as frequent as crossovers between b and vg (17%). A map that places cn between b and vg (approximately half-way) is consistent with these observations. Sturtevant expressed the distance between genes in &lt;strong&gt;map units&lt;/strong&gt;. By definition, one map unit (1 m.u.) is equivalent to a 1% recombination frequency. In honor of Morgan, one map unit, or a 1% frequency, is also called one centimorgan (cM).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="lightbox"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 9. Genetic Map Dros II" class="lightbox" src="assets/Tutorial%208%20Figure%209%20Genetic%20Map%20Dros%20II.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 171px; margin: 10px;" title="Fig. 1 Conjugation between two strains of E. coli cells.." /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, using crossover data, Sturtevant and his coworkers mapped other &lt;em&gt;Drosophila&lt;/em&gt; genes in linear arrays at particular genetic locations. This figure depicts an abbreviated genetic map of chromosome II in &lt;em&gt;Drosophila&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with many rules, there are exceptions. If genes on the same chromosome are far apart, crossovers between them can occur frequently and these genes can have a maximum recombination frequency of 50%. These genes would appear to assort independently and may mistakenly be thought to exist on different chromosomes because they are so far apart on their chromosome that linkage is not observed in genetic crosses. These genes are mapped by adding the recombination frequencies from crosses involving intermediate genes, and by determining the approximate distance of each gene from the intermediates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Genetic Recombination and Meiosis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="lightbox"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 10. Crossing over during meiosis." class="lightbox" src="assets/Tutorial%208%20Figure%2010%20Crossing%20over.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 124px; margin: 10px;" title="Figure 10. Crossing over during meiosis." /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In sexual reproduction, the events involving chromosomes during gametogenesis are responsible for the majority of genetic variation that arises in offspring. Most of this variability takes place during the first meiotic division (meiosis I) and involves genetic recombination between maternal and paternal chromosomes and the independent assortment of different chromosomes. This figure depicts the consequence of two crossover events between homologous chromosomes. Note that two of the meiotic products are different from the parents&amp;#39; chromosomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="0" src="http://c.gigcount.com/wildfire/IMP/CXNID=2000002.0NXC/bT*xJmx*PTEzMDc3OTcyMDk4NDAmcHQ9MTMwNzc5NzIxNDAyNSZwPTIwNjQyMSZkPWIyMTA2NDI5Jmc9MiZvPTk2NjhhNGRlZDA4/NDRmNzlhYTY1ZTI4N2RlOTA2Y2E4Jm9mPTA=.gif" style="visibility: hidden; width: 0px; height: 0px;" width="0" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;object align="" height="480" width="640"&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2106600" /&gt;&lt;param name="wmode" value="transparent" /&gt;&lt;embed align="" height="480" src="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2106600" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="640" wmode="transparent"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tutorial examined the consequences of gene linkage and how crossing over in meiosis can alter the co-segregation pattern of genes that are located on the same chromosome. Recall that during prophase I, homologous chromosomes pair up, gene-for-gene. Occasionally this pairing leads to breakage and rejoining of regions of homologous chromosomes. In other words, portions of a maternally derived chromatid can exchange and become physically connected with regions of a paternally derived chromatid (and vice-versa). Any gene located on either side of this junction will become unlinked. The absolute point where crossover occurs cannot be predicted with certainty (although some regions of the chromosome are more prone to this than others); however, the greater the distance that two genes are from one another on the same chromosome, the greater the likelihood that crossing over will occur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the probability for crossing over increases proportionately with the distance between two linked genes, then the frequency at which they become unlinked (due to crossovers) is an indirect measure of how far apart these genes are from one another. If you don&amp;#39;t understand why this is so, you might find it helpful to draw a couple of cartoons of chromosomes with two hypothetical genes at different distances from one another. Draw one set with the two genes 1/2 inch apart, and the other set with them one inch apart. If, on average, a crossover occurs once every four inches, then 25% of the time the two genes located one inch apart will become unlinked. However, the two genes located 1/2 inch apart will only become unlinked 12.5% of the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The relationship between gene distance and recombination frequency can be used to map the relative location of a gene on a chromosome. Be sure that you understand the logics behind this process that allows geneticists to map the relative order of genes on a chromosome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Introduction and Goals&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, we have dealt with the behavior of genes between generations and focused on the phenotypes of individuals. Next we&amp;#39;ll take a broader look at genetics and see how the genetics of populations are studied. As you will learn, the behavior of populations in response to their environments brings about evolutionary change. In fact, evolutionary change is determined by changes in the genetic composition of a population. The field of population genetics spans the disciplines of genetics and evolution. By the end of this tutorial you should have a working understanding of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Population genetics&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;How to define a species&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;How genetic variation in a population is studied&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The Hardy-Weinberg equation&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The factors that influence changes in allele frequencies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Population Genetics&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;population&lt;/strong&gt; is a group of organisms that are members of the same species and that live in the same geographical area. While natural selection occurs at the level of the individual, through variations in fitness among individuals, evolution occurs at the population level. The reason for this is demonstrated in the following table:&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The genotype of an individual is, for the most part, determined at the moment of fertilization and cannot be changed during that individual&amp;#39;s lifetime. However, because populations are comprised of many individuals from different generations, the allele frequencies in a population can change over time; if so, evolution may be occurring. Population geneticists focus their studies in two areas. The first area is the measurement of genetic variation within a population. Morphological characters (e.g., variations in length, weight, coloration) and molecular characters (e.g., variations in nucleotide sequences of DNA or in amino acid sequences of proteins) are examined and quantified. The second area is the examination of the mechanisms by which genetic variation changes over space and time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The evolutionary forces that can influence allele frequencies will be examined in the section on &lt;a href="https://online.science.psu.edu/biol110_sandbox_2381/node/8923" target="_blank" title="Tutorial 10 - Genetic Change in Populations"&gt;Genetic Change in Populations&lt;/a&gt;. In this section we will examine how allele frequencies are used to make predictions about the genotypes of a population.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;What is a Species?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 1 Geographic Range of the American BullfrogMap Reference: http://www.npwrc.usgs.gov/narcam/idguide/bullfrog.htm%5C" src="assets/Tutorial%209%20Figure%201%20Geographic%20Range.jpg" title="Figure 1 Geographic Range of the American BullfrogMap Reference: http://www.npwrc.usgs.gov/narcam/idguide/bullfrog.htm%5C" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we study genetically related populations, we are studying groups of individuals that are all members of the same species. What is a species? This is a difficult question to answer and, in fact, tutorial 12 will focus on this topic. The problem in defining a species is that no single definition works for all cases. In this class we will use the biological species concept as our working definition. This concept defines a &lt;strong&gt;species&lt;/strong&gt; as a group of potentially interbreeding individuals that can produce fertile offspring. This potential to interbreed means that individuals can move between populations, therefore, there is &lt;strong&gt;gene flow&lt;/strong&gt; (really allele flow, because all members of a species have the same genes) between populations. Reproductive isolation from other species results in a &lt;strong&gt;gene pool&lt;/strong&gt; that is closed to alleles from other species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A species occupies an area termed its &lt;strong&gt;range&lt;/strong&gt;. The &lt;a href="http://bna.birds.cornell.edu/bna/species/064/galleries/figures/figure-1" rel="_blank"&gt;Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology&lt;/a&gt; identifies the ranges of some different species of birds in North America, such as Harris&amp;#39;s sparrow. At this site, notice that the range maps cover land and water habitats. However, it is important to note that a species is usually restricted to specific habitats within its geographic range. For example, the map to the left from the Northern Prairies Wildlife Research Center shows that the entire state of Pennsylvania is part of the range of the bullfrog (&lt;em&gt;Rana catesbieana&lt;/em&gt;); however, bullfrogs are not found on the Penn State, University Park campus. This is because bullfrog populations are found in bodies of water (e.g., ponds or lakes), therefore, they occupy only some of the habitats within their range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Genetic Variation&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 2. Gray Squirrel" src="assets/Tutorial%209%20Figure%202%20Gray%20Squirrel.jpg" style="height: 343px; width: 400px;" title="Figure 2. Gray Squirrel" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As previously mentioned, population geneticists measure the amount of genetic variation found within a species. Variations can be measured within a population and between populations. When there is no variation among the members of a population, the population is &lt;strong&gt;monomorphic&lt;/strong&gt; for that particular character; monomorphic means that just one form exists. For example, the population of squirrels (&lt;em&gt;Sciurus carolinensis&lt;/em&gt;) on the Penn State campus is monomorphic; all of the squirrels in this population have gray fur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial%209%20Figure%203%20Black%20Squirrel.jpg" style="width: 400px; height: 439px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this is not true of all squirrel populations. At Kent State, the squirrel population is &lt;strong&gt;polymorphic&lt;/strong&gt; for fur color (i.e., they have either gray or black fur).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 4. Snail Shells" src="assets/Tutorial%209%20Figure%204.%20Snail%20Shells.jpg" title="Figure 4. Snail Shells" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Variations in some populations for a given character can be extreme (as is seen in this picture showing the variation of shell colors in a species of Caribbean snail).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other factors, besides genetics, can contribute to the variation of a character within a population. For example, phenotypes can be affected by the environment. When you spend a lot of time in the sun, your skin becomes darker than what was predetermined by your genotype. As you learned, the PKU disease can be suppressed by diet. Other examples of environmental alterations are all around us. No two trees look exactly alike because branching patterns and leaf and limb numbers can be influenced by light, water, and nutrient availability. In humans, IQ and size have been linked to neonatal and youth diets. In short, the environment can influence how genetic information is expressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The Genetic Composition of a Population&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previously we examined the genotypes of individuals and how they relate to the phenotypes expressed in subsequent generations. Keep in mind, the genotype of an individual becomes fixed the moment that two gametes unite to form the diploid zygote (barring mutation). However, a population consists of a group of individuals who may differ genotypically from one another. How do we describe the genotype of a population?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The genetic makeup of a population can be described by the frequency of alleles that exist in that population. This is typically expressed as a fractional equivalent of one. In other words, a population that has only one allele for a particular gene has an allele frequency of one for that allele. If two or more alleles for a particular gene exist, then each has an allele frequency that is some fraction of one (however, they all must add up to one). In the example of cystic fibrosis, the major CF allele is found at a frequency of 0.04 (4%). This means that the wild-type allele is found at a frequency of 0.96 (96%). Note that 0.96 + 0.04 = 1. Although the number of alleles may be quite variable (some genes have dozens of alleles), the simple arithmetic relationship still applies; that is, the frequencies of alleles for a given gene must add up to one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously a population can have many genes for which alternative alleles exist. In the human population, about 30% of all genes have two or more alleles. In other words, 70% of the genes are fixed (have an allele frequency of one), whereas 30% of the genes have allele frequencies less than one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Probability and Populations&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The behavior of alternative (and sometimes deleterious) alleles found in human populations can be found in &lt;a href="https://online.science.psu.edu/biol110_sandbox_2381/node/8902"&gt;Pedigree Analysis.&lt;/a&gt; Let&amp;#39;s take a closer look at these alleles and see how the genetic composition of a population is studied. Allele frequencies can be calculated if one knows phenotypic frequencies (and vice versa).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About one in fifty persons of Caucasian ancestry are carriers of PKU. We learned that the number of affected individuals can be calculated by first calculating the odds of two carriers meeting and having children (50 x 50 = 2500 = 1:2500). Because PKU is a recessive mutation, the odds that these carriers will have an affected child is 1:4. Putting these calculations together (2500 x 4 = 10,000) means that the odds of two carriers meeting and having an affected child is 1:10,000 (using the Rule of Multiplication). At the population level this means that 1:10,000 is the frequency of the disease, and indeed, this is the case; for every 10,000 births, one Caucasian child (on average) has PKU. The logic behind these numbers should be clear. If not, review the section on &lt;a href="https://online.science.psu.edu/biol110_sandbox_2381/node/9002" target="_blank" title="Tutorial 5 - The Complex Expression Patterns of Multiple"&gt;Complex Expression&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How are allele frequencies actually determined? The &lt;strong&gt;Hardy-Weinberg equation&lt;/strong&gt; can be used to calculate allele frequencies. For example, let&amp;#39;s apply the equation to PKU disease and designate the PKU allele &quot;q,&quot; and the wild-type allele &quot;p.&quot; What is the allele frequency for the PKU allele?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The frequency of individuals that are homozygous for the PKU allele in a population is q X q = q2. You should recognize this as the Rule of Multiplication. You should also know that q2 represents the PKU-affected individuals in the population because they are homozygous for q. The frequency of individuals that have homozygous wild-type alleles (the p allele) in a population is p X p = p2. The frequency of individuals that are heterozygous in a population (PKU carriers) is p X q = pq. Note, there are two ways to get this last calculation (depending on which parent donates the q allele); therefore, the Rule of Addition is used to compute the odds of being heterozygous (pq + pq = 2pq).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a population, the frequency of PKU individuals that are homozygous for the allele + those who are heterozygous for the allele + those who are homozygous for the wild-type allele = 1. In other words, p2 + 2pq + q2 = 1. This is the Hardy-Weinberg equation. (You may also recognize this as a binomial expansion.) Before going on, be sure you understand what these terms represent and how to derive any term given the other two terms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, let&amp;#39;s solve our original PKU problem. Restated, what is the allele frequency for the PKU allele (q)? We know that the phenotypic frequency of PKU disease is 1:10,000 or 0.0001. Remember that this is the phenotypic frequency, but we want to determine the allele frequency for the PKU allele (q). Recognize that q2 is the phenotypic frequency (affected individuals) in the Hardy-Weinberg equation. Therefore, the square root of the phenotypic frequency will equal the allele frequency of the PKU allele. The square root of 0.0001 is 0.01.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because the wild-type allele (p) + the PKU allele (q) must equal one (p + q = 1), we can determine the wild-type allele frequency. 1.0 - 0.01 = 0.99 = wild-type allele frequency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Applying the Hardy-Weinberg Equation&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let&amp;#39;s try a problem using the squirrels from Kent State, which were described earlier in this tutorial. Take out a piece of paper and work along with the following description.&amp;nbsp; The key to understanding the equation is writing it out yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 3. Black Squirrel" src="assets/Tutorial%209%20Figure%203%20Black%20Squirrel.jpg" style="height: 439px; width: 400px;" title="Figure 3. Black Squirrel" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose that you have decided to visit Kent State for the weekend to see these squirrels for yourself. You want to determine the frequency of black (&lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt;) and gray (&lt;em&gt;b&lt;/em&gt;) alleles in the squirrel population. Since it is not possible to see all of the squirrels on campus, you decide to count 100 squirrels and use this as your sample to determine the allele frequencies. By the end of the day you have scored 100 squirrels; 84 were black and 16 were gray. Next you need to use the Hardy-Weinberg equation to determine the frequency of these two alleles in this population. At first you decide that the allele frequencies are 0.84 for the &lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt; allele and 0.16 for the &lt;em&gt;b&lt;/em&gt; allele. Is this correct? Are you overlooking something? When you see a black squirrel, what is its genotype? Black squirrels are either &lt;em&gt;BB&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Bb&lt;/em&gt;. So some black squirrels are carrying the &lt;em&gt;b&lt;/em&gt; allele. Black is a complete dominant, therefore, there is no way to tell which squirrels are heterozygous for this allele.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since you do not know if a black squirrel has a &lt;em&gt;BB&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Bb&lt;/em&gt; genotype, you cannot use the number of black squirrels to determine the frequency of the black allele. But what about gray squirrels? Since gray is recessive to black, all of the gray squirrels are genotype &lt;em&gt;bb&lt;/em&gt;, or they represent the q2 value in the p2 + 2pq + q2 equation. Suddenly this is looking much easier. If q2 = 16/100 = 0.16, then q = the square root of 0.16 = 0.4. Since p + q = 1, then 1 - q = p, so 1 - 0.4 = 0.6 = p. So the frequency of the black allele (&lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt;) is 0.6 and the frequency of the gray allele (&lt;em&gt;b&lt;/em&gt;) is 0.4. Now that you have this information, you can estimate the frequencies of the different genotypes in the population: &lt;em&gt;BB&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Bb&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;bb&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Multiple Alleles&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 5. ABO Blood Group" src="assets/Tutorial%209%20Figure%205.%20ABO%20blood%20group.jpg" style="height: 344px; width: 217px;" title="Figure 5. ABO Blood Group" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of the cases that we have examined have had a single gene with two alleles. But what about genes that have three or more alleles? Basically this is dealt with in the same way, but the determination of allele frequencies becomes a bit more involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The human ABO blood group system was discussed in the section on &lt;a href="https://online.science.psu.edu/biol110_sandbox_2381/node/9002"&gt;The Complex Expression of Patterns of Multiple Allels&lt;/a&gt;. This was used as an example of a gene with multiple alleles (IA, IIB, &lt;em&gt;i&lt;/em&gt;) and codominance because both alleles are expressed in AB heterozygous individuals. The O allele (designated as &lt;em&gt;i&lt;/em&gt;) is recessive to the IA and IB alleles. In the human population, the IA allele has a frequency of 0.3 and the IB allele has a frequency of 0.1. Pull out a piece of paper and a pencil and write down these numbers. In the next few questions you will learn how three alleles can be handled by the Hardy-Weinberg equation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may take you some time to get through these questions. They are tough, but once you understand the logic behind their solutions, you will be able to handle similar questions with ease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Using the Hardy-Weinberg Equation in Evolutionary Studies&lt;object align="" data="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2107360" height="480" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="640"&gt;&lt;param name="quality" value="high" /&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2107360" /&gt;&lt;param name="wmode" value="transparent" /&gt;&lt;embed align="" height="480" hspace="10" quality="high" src="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2107360" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" vspace="10" width="640" wmode="transparent"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should now appreciate how the Hardy-Weinberg equation can be used to study the genetic composition of a population. But how does this fit into evolution studies?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer is that changes in allele frequencies are the most fundamental indication that evolution might be occurring. If two populations of the same species have the same allele frequency for a given gene, it can be concluded that natural selection is not operating on that gene (at least at that time). On the other hand, if the allele frequencies are different for a given gene, then natural selection may be operative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Importantly, natural selection is only one factor that can influence changes in allele frequencies. At least four other factors can also affect a change in allele frequency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First is a small population size. If the population is small, then random changes in the gene pool (&lt;strong&gt;genetic drift&lt;/strong&gt;) can alter the allele frequency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second is migration/immigration. If individuals migrate into or immigrate out of a given population, they can affect the allele frequency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third are mutations. Spontaneous mutations create new alleles, and these can affect allele frequencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fourth are nonrandom matings. If mate selection is not random (for a particular gene), then this can alter the allele frequency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In practice, if population geneticists see a change in the allele frequency for a given allele and if they can eliminate these four factors, then natural selection is likely responsible for the observed change. If allele frequencies remain stable between generations, then the population is considered to be in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	This tutorial covered the basic principles of population genetics. A population is a group of organisms that are members of the same biological species and that live in the same geographic area. There can be gene flow between different populations of a biological species, however, this reproductive isolation creates a gene pool that excludes alleles entering from other species. Characters in a population can be monomorphic, showing no variation, or polymorphic, having at least two different variants. Variation can be caused by the organism&amp;#39;s genotype or by environmental effects. The Hardy-Weinberg equation can be used to examine genetic variation within populations. In the case of two alleles for a gene, the sum of the frequency of the alleles equals 1 or 100%. This is represented by the equation p + q = 1. To determine the frequencies of the three possible genotypes, use the equation p2 + 2pq + q2 = 1. When the allele frequencies stay the same between generations, the population is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium requires that allele frequencies within a population remain the same from one generation to the next, as long as certain conditions (including no mutation and no natural selection) are met. The next tutorial will explore the evolutionary forces that can cause changes in allele and/or genotype frequencies in a population; that is, changes that lead to microevolution.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;h2&gt;Terms&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should have a working knowledge of the following terms:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;assortative mating&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;bottleneck effect&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;fitness&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;founder effect&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;inbreeding&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;macroevolution&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;microevolution&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;mutation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Introduction and Goals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previously we examined how the genetic composition of a population is studied. In this tutorial we will examine the conditions that can alter genetic compositions. This theme is central to evolution. Genetically stable populations (those in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium) do not evolve, however, genetically unstable populations do undergo evolutionary change. We will examine those conditions that affect genetic stability, and hence contribute to evolutionary change. By the end of this tutorial you should have a basic understanding of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;How the founder effect and bottleneck effect relate to genetic drift&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;How gene flow, mutations, and mating behavior can affect genetic stability&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;How selection can influence allele frequency&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Microevolution versus Macroevolution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evolution is a continuous process, but major evolutionary changes are rare events. Major evolutionary changes distinguish one population from another and result in the creation of a new species. Evolutionary changes that mark the appearance of a new species (or genera and higher) are &lt;strong&gt;macroevolutionary&lt;/strong&gt; events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, evolution can occur within a species. Think about the human allele for sickle-cell disease; populations living in areas with high incidences of malaria are better adapted because of the high frequency of this allele. Hence, evolution of human populations has occurred in the past, is occurring today, and will continue to occur. Changes that lead to alterations in allele frequencies are &lt;strong&gt;microevolutionary&lt;/strong&gt; events. At the most basic level, evolution is a change in allele frequencies and genotype frequencies in a population from generation to generation. A population is evolving even if allele frequencies are fluctuating at just one chromosomal location. At the population level, therefore, evolution is a nearly continuous process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have discussed how natural selection adapts organisms to their environment. As you learned from the example of the sickle-cell allele (&lt;a href="https://online.science.psu.edu/biol110_sandbox_2381/node/8902"&gt;Pedigree Analysis&lt;/a&gt;), this adaptation results in a change in allele frequency. As you will soon learn, however, natural selection is only one mechanism that can change allele frequencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Population Size&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a geneticist&amp;#39;s point of view, a population composed of hundreds or thousands of individuals is less likely to evolve than a small population. The larger the population, the more buffering there is against random variations in allele frequencies; an infinite size population would be almost completely resistant to random fluctuations. As you will learn, small populations are especially vulnerable to the loss of genetic variability due to random events; in fact, they may evolve into extinction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Genetic Drift&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Small populations are more likely to experience genetic drift (random fluctuations of allele and genotype frequencies). If a population has an allele frequency of &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.25 or 1/4, then the allele frequency of &lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt; is 1 - 0.25 = 0.75 or 3/4. (Recall, the sum of all individual allele frequencies for a particular gene must add up to 1.) Therefore, for each &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; allele, there are 3 &lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt; alleles in the population (or a 1:3 ratio). If a population consists of 1000 individuals and 1000 X 2 = 2000 alleles, then 500 of the alleles in the gene pool would be &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; (2 X 250) and 1500 of the alleles would be &lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt; (2 X 750). If the alleles are counted in the next generation, they may have drifted by five alleles (e.g., to 505 and 1495), but the new allele frequencies would be 0.253 and 0.748, which is not dramatically different from the original values of 0.25 and 0.75. Although there is a measurable change, it would take many generations before one allele became fixed in the population and the other eliminated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, if the population in the example above contained only 10 individuals (2 X 10 = 20 alleles) and the initial allele frequencies were again &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.25 and &lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt; = 0.75, then there would be 5 &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; alleles (2 X 2.5) and 15 &lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt; alleles (2 X 7.5) in the population. If the next generation also drifted by five alleles, then there would be 10 &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; alleles (5 + 5) and 10 &lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt; alleles (15 - 5). Therefore, in one generation the allele frequencies would go from 0.25 and 0.75 to 0.5 and 0.5. If both alleles are selectively neutral (have no effect on fitness), then each faces a probability of being lost in the course of several generations, and eventually one allele will become fixed in the population. Heterozygosity at that chromosomal location will then be equal to zero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next we&amp;#39;ll examine the two major situations that restrict population sizes and lead to genetic drift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Bottleneck Effect&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One situation that can result in genetic drift is the &lt;strong&gt;bottleneck effect&lt;/strong&gt;. A bottlenecking event (e.g., earthquakes, fires, over-hunting) decimates a population and results in only a small fraction of the population surviving. In a bottlenecking event, the remaining randomly selected survivors may not have the same allele and genotype frequencies as the original population. In the new population, some alleles may be found at higher frequencies, whereas others may be found at lower frequencies or even lost altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a small but rapidly reproducing population, the new allele frequencies may settle into a new equilibrium within one or a few generations and genetic drift will typically affect the population for a number of generations until the population size becomes so large that genetic drift is negligible. While natural disasters have historically been the cause of bottleneck effects, overzealous hunting can also cause this effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 1.  Cheetah in Botswana" src="assets/Tutorial10_Figure1bCheetah_Botswana.jpg" style="height: 225px; width: 300px;" title="Figure 1.  Cheetah in Botswana" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many endangered species, such as this cheetah (shown here) and the American buffalo, were subject in recent history to overhunting. Although the cheetah is increasing in numbers, due to increased protective measures, all existing individuals are genetically similar, which weakens the surviving population. Even when a species, such as the cheetah, is protected following a bottlenecking event, the loss of genetic variability may make the species more likely to go extinct. Genetically homogeneous populations are more prone to catastrophes because a given insult (e.g., a disease or a predator) can sweep through the entire population quickly; without variation, there is no natural selection. Hence, conservation efforts must not only preserve numbers, they must also promote genetic variability. Only when some individuals are better suited to the environment than others, can evolution increase the adaptability of a population to its environment. Perhaps the potential to undergo natural selection is one of the best measures of a healthy population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is reason to think that bottleneck effects might play a major role in extinction. There is evidence that major catastrophic events (e.g., meteor strikes) might have led to major bottleneck effects in Earth&amp;#39;s past. Such events might not have necessarily killed off all members of a species (e.g., dinosaurs), but might have decimated their population enough such that they became genetically weakened due to a loss in variability; eventually these populations died out. One book with a catchy title, &quot;Extinction: Bad Genes or Bad Luck?&quot; by David M. Raup, explores this idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A disease that kills only individuals with a genetic predisposition is not an example of a bottleneck event. This would be natural selection at work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Founder Effect&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another situation that can result in genetic drift is the &lt;strong&gt;founder effect&lt;/strong&gt;. A founder effect occurs when a few individuals (founding individuals) become geographically separated from the original population and they form a new colony. The alleles present in the founding individuals make up the gene pool of the new population. Most likely, the founding individuals will not accurately represent the allele and genotype frequencies of the original population, nor will they possess all of the variation present in the original population. Because it would take several generations before their population would increase much in size, genetic drift would continue to influence the allele frequencies of the population. This effect is most commonly seen on remote islands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 2.  Island of Tristan da Cunha" src="assets/Tutorial%2010%20Figure%202%20Tristan%20da%20Cunha.jpg" title="Figure 2.  Island of Tristan da Cunha" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An example of the founder effect in human populations occurs on the island of Tristan da Cunha. This island was settled in the 1800&amp;#39;s by fifteen British immigrants. There have only been a couple of migrations since; today there are just seven surnames on this island that has about 250 inhabitants. Expectedly, this leads to problems associated with &lt;strong&gt;inbreeding&lt;/strong&gt; (the mating of closely related individuals). One notable problem is the occurrence of retinitis pigmentosa (a rare form of blindness), which occurs at a much higher frequency in this population than in the original population.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="0" src="http://c.gigcount.com/wildfire/IMP/CXNID=2000002.0NXC/bT*xJmx*PTEzMDc5ODUxMTM3MTMmcHQ9MTMwNzk4NTEyNzQxNCZwPTIwNjQyMSZkPWIyMTA3OTg4Jmc9MiZvPTk2NjhhNGRlZDA4/NDRmNzlhYTY1ZTI4N2RlOTA2Y2E4Jm9mPTA=.gif" style="visibility: hidden; width: 0px; height: 0px;" width="0" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Gene Flow&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Populations remain genetically stable if no alleles enter or leave the population. Recall, a change in allele frequencies due to interactions with outside populations is termed gene flow (introduced in &lt;a href="https://online.science.psu.edu/biol110_sandbox_2381/node/8918"&gt;Genes in Populations&lt;/a&gt;). If a population were fixed for one allele at a certain chromosomal location and a gamete carrying an alternative allele were able to fertilize an individual from that population, then the allele frequencies would shift and the population would undergo microevolution. However, if the population were large and if the new allele was not selectively advantageous, then the population would quickly stabilize to a new equilibrium. Conversely, if the population were very small or if the new allele conferred a reproductive advantage, then the allele frequencies would probably continue to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mutations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;A &lt;strong&gt;mutation&lt;/strong&gt; is a change in an organism&amp;#39;s DNA. Mutations may instantly introduce a new allele into a population, causing small but intermediate shifts in allele and genotype frequencies. Because mutations are the ultimate source of all genetic variation, they collectively are extremely powerful in influencing evolution. In general, however, most mutations have either no effect or no discernable effect on phenotypes. Because several different combinations of nucleotides may code for the same amino acid, a mutation may result in an unaltered protein. Conversely, there are many other types of mutations that can cause major disruptions. These mutations almost always result in a nonfunctional or less efficient product, but if the mutation strikes a region of nontranscribed DNA, then the mutation may have no detectable effect on the organism. Very rarely, a mutation may result in a protein that is slightly more efficient, or that performs a new function. In order for the frequency of the mutant allele to increase as a result of natural selection, the advantage would have to be great enough to affect the individual&amp;#39;s reproductive success or survivorship. Therefore, although an assumption when applying the Hardy-Weinberg equation is that no net mutations occur, most mutations have little effect on the allele frequencies of a population overall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 3.  The King Cheetah has a recessive fur pattern mutation that causing a racing stripe pattern." src="assets/Tutorial10_Figure1aKing_cheetah_Racing%20Stripes.jpg" style="height: 453px; width: 300px;" title="Figure 3.  The King Cheetah has a recessive fur pattern mutation that causing a racing stripe pattern." /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Random versus Nonrandom Mating&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Random mate selection favors genetic stability. Nonrandom mate selection often occurs in natural populations because an individual is more likely to choose a mate from his or her vicinity than from more distant corners of the population. Frequent near-neighbor matings tend to subdivide the population&amp;#39;s gene pool into subpopulations that have less genetic diversity than the gene pool at large.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inbreeding (the mating of closely related individuals) was described earlier in this tutorial. Self-fertilization (&quot;selfing&quot; - introduced in &lt;a href="https://online.science.psu.edu/biol110_sandbox_2381/node/8986"&gt;Mendel and Modern Genetics&lt;/a&gt;) occurs when an individual fertilizes some of its own gametes (a common occurrence in plants). Both of these mating processes decrease the level of heterozygosity in their offspring. Normal healthy individuals can carry several or many deleterious alleles. Although each individual may carry some deleterious alleles, unrelated individuals are likely to be carriers of different alleles. Therefore, most of the resulting offspring will be healthy carriers as well. If the parents are closely related, however, then the level of homozygosity in the offspring will be higher. In this way, some of the deleterious alleles may be randomly lost, but it is more likely that some of the recessive deleterious alleles will occur in the homozygous state, exposing those individuals to selection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, individuals may choose mates that have some of the same phenotypic traits (e.g., body size or height) as themselves. This is termed &lt;strong&gt;assortative mating&lt;/strong&gt;. Although these kinds of characters are complex, involving numerous genes, they are still usually heritable. Mating of genetically similar (although not necessarily related) individuals tends to increase the amount of homozygosity in the population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Genetic Stability and Selection Pressure&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tutorial has focused on how random events can affect allele frequencies, hence affecting the genetic stability of populations. Even deleterious alleles may increase in frequency due to chance events (recall the Tristan da Cunha example).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most important conditions for genetic stability is that all individuals have the same &lt;strong&gt;fitness&lt;/strong&gt; (fitness is a measure of reproductive success - an individual who produces more offsprng than another has greater fitness). Even minor deviations from this state can cause some individuals to produce more offspring than others, resulting in a steady change in allele frequencies. Any alleles that directly or indirectly affect an individual&amp;#39;s ability to survive, mate, or reproduce may respond to selection pressure. Under very severe selection pressure (e.g., when bacteria are exposed to a strong antibiotic), a mutation conferring some form of resistance can increase in frequency in the population very quickly. In fact, &lt;a href="http://www.fda.gov/oc/opacom/hottopics/anti_resist.html" rel="_blank"&gt;antibiotic resistance&lt;/a&gt; (read &quot;A Growing Threat&quot;) is becoming a major health risk, and &lt;a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/evolution/library/10/1/l_101_02.html" rel="_blank"&gt;pesticide resistance&lt;/a&gt; is a major concern to agriculturists. As you will learn, the example of antibiotic resistance is a result of natural selection because the surviving, resistant individuals are better adapted to their environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, an allele that makes an individual more vulnerable to disease or predation is likely to be under very strong selection pressure and may decrease in frequency very rapidly, until it is either very rare in the population or purged completely from the gene pool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Genetic Variation&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of the phenomena discussed in this tutorial acts to change the frequency of alleles or genotypes in an evolving population. A population in which all of these forces are negligible or absent will remain in a state of equilibrium and allele frequencies will remain the same across generations. Few populations remain in equilibrium for very long, primarily due to the large amounts of genetic variation in natural populations. Frequently, individuals differ from one another in many ways (e.g., from neutral molecular differences in amino acid sequences to differences in appearance, ability, and behavior). Even under relatively strong selection pressure or very small population sizes, it can take many generations for an allele to become fixed. Even under controlled laboratory breeding programs, it can take many generations for a recessive deleterious allele to be removed from the population. Once an allele becomes sufficiently rare in the population, it is unlikely to be found in the homozygous state. Natural selection (one of the strongest and most directional of the evolutionary forces) can only act on the phenotype. Therefore, a recessive allele can linger for a very long time in a population if it is only rarely exposed to natural selection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, although an individual may have a low fitness level, this may not be indicative of his or her genotype. Not all variation is heritable, and environmental influences (e.g., weather, nutrition, and availability of potential mates) may overwhelm subtle differences in genotypes. A well fed but genetically inferior animal may have greater reproductive potential than a genetically superior but undernourished animal. In this case, natural selection would not lead to a population better adapted to its environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="0" src="http://c.gigcount.com/wildfire/IMP/CXNID=2000002.0NXC/bT*xJmx*PTEzMDc5ODUyMDY4NzQmcHQ9MTMwNzk4NTIxMDEzMyZwPTIwNjQyMSZkPWIyMTA3OTkzJmc9MiZvPTk2NjhhNGRlZDA4/NDRmNzlhYTY1ZTI4N2RlOTA2Y2E4Jm9mPTA=.gif" style="visibility: hidden; width: 0px; height: 0px;" width="0" /&gt;&lt;object align="" data="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2107993" height="480" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="640"&gt;&lt;param name="quality" value="high" /&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2107993" /&gt;&lt;param name="wmode" value="transparent" /&gt;&lt;embed align="" height="480" hspace="10" quality="high" src="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2107993" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" vspace="10" width="640" wmode="transparent"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Summary&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tutorial examined population genetics, with reference to microevolution. Microevolution refers to the change in allele frequencies in a gene pool of a population over generations. A population is a group of interbreeding individuals. Over many generations, these changes can lead to new species. However, different populations of the same species can be undergoing different types of microevolutionary changes but still interbreed; hence, by definition, they are still members of the same species. (Think about the races of humans.) Keep in mind, microevolution describes small changes in a population over successive generations, and does not necessarily mean that two populations will eventually become new species. (Although this can happen over many generations.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hardy-Weinberg equation can be used to determine the allele frequency in a population. Thus, it provides a useful tool to describe the degree of microevolution that is taking place over successive generations. Not all populations are undergoing microevolution at all times. In certain stable environments, many populations show no evidence for microevolution. (Although if the conditions change, then microevolution often commences.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a number of conditions that predictably decrease microevolution; namely: large populations that are more genetically stable compared to smaller populations; no migration/immigration by which new alleles are introduced or removed from a population; no mutations to introduce new alleles; random matings that allow all individuals equal access to all alleles and; no natural selection that causes changes in allele frequencies due to fitness differences between individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conversely, opposing conditions increase microevolution; namely: small populations are genetically unstable because they are susceptible to genetic drift; migration/immigration that allows alleles to enter or leave a population; mutations that introduce new alleles; nonrandom matings that cause unequal access to all alleles; and natural selection that changes allele frequencies to favor individuals&amp;#39; reproductive capacity and fitness.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

			&lt;/td&gt;
		&lt;/tr&gt;
	&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Introduction and Goals&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept of natural selection is sometimes oversimplified as &quot;survival of the fittest.&quot; You will learn why this is an oversimplification. In short, there are many different ways that natural selection can influence the composition of a population. By the end of the tutorial you should have a basic understanding of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The three major modes of natural selection&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Why sexual selection is not a mode of natural selection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Fitness and Selection&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within a typical population, many characters exhibit variation in the form of alternative traits. Some character traits vary continuously, from one extreme to another (e.g., height in a human population), and are referred to as quantitative characters (discussed in tutorial #5, under Polygenic Inheritance). Conversely, some traits vary discretely (e.g., eye color).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of these character traits may provide certain individuals with an advantage not possessed by others in the population. If these individuals show differential reproductive success (i.e. they are more fit), then the allele(s) encoding the trait will increase in frequency and natural selection will take place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fitness&lt;/strong&gt; is a term that has a precise biological meaning; namely, reproductive success. Fitness is typically referenced relatively. In simplest terms, an individual who produces four offspring is relatively more fit than one who produces three offspring (providing all offspring themselves survive to reproduce, and hence, are more fit themselves). Thus, the individual producing four fit offspring contribute 25% more of their genetic code to the next generation than the individual producing three fit offspring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By this definition of fitness, individuals can die young and be fit, providing they produce offspring. Conversely, individuals can be long-lived and unfit if they fail to reproduce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The Salmon Example&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An organism&amp;#39;s success has little to do, per se, with its longevity, but rather, its ability to reproduce. Many successful plants (e.g., annual wildflowers) grow for a season, reproduce, and then die. Many successful insects live for only twenty-four hours but still manage to reproduce in order to make their contribution to the gene pool. In some cases, individuals contribute more to the next generation than simply their genes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Salmon inhabit Pacific waters and spend most of their lives in seawater, but migrate to freshwater streams to breed. The salmon that live in the Pacific Ocean and reproduce in headwater streams (small streams found at higher altitudes where few nutrients exist) have life cycles of approximately 4-5 years. The salmon that survive this perilous journey (approximately 1 in 100) reproduce and then die in the streams where they were born. This doesn&amp;#39;t sound like a pleasant existence, however, it actually is a great adaptation to the next generation. By dying immediately after reproduction, adult salmon indirectly provide for their young.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 1.  Salmon jumping upstream" src="assets/Tutorial%2011%20Figure%201%20Salmon%20Jumping%20Upstream.jpg" style="height: 300px; width: 400px;" title="Figure 1.  Salmon jumping upstream" /&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How does this work?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most Pacific coast headwater streams lack abundant nutrients. The nutrients released from the dead adult salmon enrich the stream and feed algal blooms and invertebrates. In turn, these organisms are a key food source to the hatching offspring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Darwin&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 2. Charles Darwin" src="assets/Tutorial%2011_Figure%202%20Hw-darwin.jpg" style="height: 558px; width: 400px;" title="Figure 2. Charles Darwin" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charles Darwin was 22 years old when he accepted an unpaid position aboard the H.M.S. Beagle. The Beagle sailed on a surveying expedition, primarily to chart the South American coastline. Among other things, Darwin observed many plant and animal species on the Galapagos Islands (off the coast of Ecuador) that exist nowhere else in the world. The species on these islands exhibit great diversity, the most notable being the finches of the Galapagos. The differences in feeding adaptations among these finches led Darwin to describe how such adaptations arise in species. Darwin&amp;#39;s observations from the voyage later supported his theory of natural selection in &lt;em&gt;The Origin of Species&lt;/em&gt;. In this work, Darwin described two processes. In one process, &quot;descent with modification,&quot; Darwin suggested that all life descended from one original form and that diversity was the result of adaptations. Toward the end of &lt;em&gt;The Origin of Species&lt;/em&gt;, he used the word evolution. The other process he described was natural selection. We will discuss these processes in the remainder of this tutorial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At some point, you should consider reading Darwin&amp;#39;s book. Although written over 150 years ago, it is still relevant and it is easy to read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Natural Selection&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Natural selection describes how populations, over time, adapt to their environments. Adaptation is based on the generational selection of certain beneficial alleles that will, over time, increase in frequency (and conversely, less advantageous alleles will decrease in frequency). For example, let&amp;#39;s say in a certain species of bird there is an allele that leads to curly wing feathers. While these curly feathers may be nice to look at, they may not lead to an increase in fitness. On the contrary, these curly-feathered birds are likely poor flyers and they do not live sufficiently long enough in the wild to reproduce. As a consequence, the curly-wing allele is not very prominent in the population because birds having this allele don&amp;#39;t live long enough to breed and contribute the allele to the next generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Natural selection can only act on available phenotypic variations within the population. These phenotypic variations are reflections of genotypic variations, which arise from random mutations in the genome, crossing over during meiosis, and sexual reproduction itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are over 160 documented cases of natural selection occurring in wild populations. The pepper moth (&lt;em&gt;Biston betularia&lt;/em&gt;) story is often used to illustrate natural selection. There are two forms of the moth: one mottled (light-colored) and one black. In natural conditions, the mottled phenotype is more common because it mimics lichen on trees and because birds prey on the black moth. During the Industrial Revolution, soot from factories darkened the trees and poor air quality destroyed the lichen. This resulted in a shift of the phenotype frequency curve because the mottled phenotype became more visible to predators, and thus became the prey of choice for birds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Adaptation and the Environment&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 3. Fairy Shrimp" src="assets/Tutorial%2011%20Figure%203%20Fairy%20Shrimp.jpg" title="Figure 3. Fairy Shrimp" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Natural selection acts upon the available phenotypes in a population to adapt them to their environment by increasing or maintaining favorable genotypes; hence, the better-suited individuals survive. For example, fairy shrimp have adapted to vernal pools (seasonal bodies of water that fill up in the spring and dry up in the summer). The shrimp complete their life cycle in as little as two weeks; hatching, breeding, and then dying. The eggs sit in the sediment until the vernal pool fills up again, and then they hatch and continue their life cycle. In this way, fairy shrimp are well adapted to an environment that certainly would not be suitable to many other aquatic organisms. By passing on their genes to the next generation, the shrimp are exhibiting fitness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind, rarely does a single species live in a particular environment. Life is often a competition between species, and if one species gains an advantage (via a new beneficial allele), then it often is at the expense of other individuals and species living in the same environment. This idea of a continuous race between species to be the best adapted for a particular environment is referred to as the &quot;Red Queen Hypothesis&quot; (from a line uttered by the Red Queen in &lt;em&gt;Alice in Wonderland&lt;/em&gt;; i.e., &quot;Here, you see, it takes all the running you do to keep in the same place.&quot;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Types of Selection&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An organism has specific traits that are expressed, and these can be influenced by the environment. Recall that the collective expression of traits is referred to as the phenotype. A change in a trait (e.g., flower color) results in an alternative phenotype. It follows then that any change in a population&amp;#39;s phenotypic frequency may be a reflection of a changing environment. The pepper moths described earlier represent a good example of this phenomenon. When air quality declined, the darker moths became more common (i.e., the bark on trees became darker with soot and light moths were more visible on the bark, compared to dark moths). Now that air quality has improved, the mottled and lighter phenotype is more common.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first one might conclude that natural selection always shows a clear increase, over time, of one trait (and a decrease of another). Indeed this occurs (as in the moth example), however, more complex situations give rise to alternative phenotypic distributions. These situations are described by three major modes of natural selection. These modes are used to visualize the microevolution of a population. The three modes will be examined next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Mode of Selection 1 - Stabilizing Selection&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stabilizing selection&lt;/strong&gt; favors intermediate variants by acting against extreme phenotypes. Organisms that display stabilizing selection may carry ancestral character traits. Open this animation and click on stabilizing, then the play button to see how stabilizing selection favors an intermediate phenotype.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 4.  Horseshoe Crabs" src="assets/Tutorial%2011%20Figure%204%20Horseshoe%20Crabs.jpg" style="height: 391px; width: 400px;" title="Figure 4.  Horseshoe Crabs" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One condition that favors stabilizing selection is a stable environment. Many terrestrial, aquatic, and marine environments don&amp;#39;t change much from year to year. Stabilizing selection can also occur when extremes are a disadvantage. Birth weights in humans are an excellent example. If a baby is born too small, it may not survive. Conversely, if it is born too big, it may not get out of the womb safely or it may endanger the mother (and/or itself).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The horseshoe crab has many stable character traits that display stabilizing selection. Horseshoe crabs represent a group of very ancient arthropods that have inhabited shallow ocean waters. These organisms are very well adapted to scavenging on sandy bottoms. They are a good example of stabilizing selection because many of their features have not changed in the past 250 million years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Mode of Selection 2 - Directional Selection&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;object align="" classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0" data="/courses/biol110/sites/edu.courses.biol110/files/images/modes_selectionEMBED.swf" height="480" hspace="10" title="Three Modes of Selection" vspace="10" width="640"&gt;&lt;param name="quality" value="high" /&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="/courses/biol110/sites/edu.courses.biol110/files/images/modes_selectionEMBED.swf" /&gt;&lt;embed height="480" hspace="10" pluginspage="http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer" quality="high" src="/courses/biol110/sites/edu.courses.biol110/files/images/modes_selectionEMBED.swf" title="Three Modes of Selection" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" vspace="10" width="640"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Directional selection&lt;/strong&gt; favors individuals that are at one end of the phenotypic range, usually during periods of environmental change. This type of selection favors the variants of one extreme by selecting against the other extreme; thus, resulting in a shift of the phenotype frequency curve. Open this animation Animation 1, click on directional, then the play button to see how directional selection favors variants at one extreme of the phenotypic range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, changes in weather patterns can cause directional selection. Let&amp;#39;s say that a group of relatively tall plants exists in an area without much wind. The weather patterns change and the plants are now exposed to greater wind forces. We might expect the phenotype frequency curve to shift toward shorter plants that can withstand the environmental pressure. The pepper moth mentioned earlier is another example of directional selection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Mode of Selection 3 - Diversifying Selection&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diversifying selection&lt;/strong&gt; (also referred to as disruptive selection) favors individuals at both extremes of the phenotypic range, usually during periods of environmental change. Open this animation, click on diversifying, then the play button to see how diversifying selection selects variants at both extremes of a phenotypic range. Imagine a population in which the main food supply has decreased. Because less preferred food exists, the variants of both extremes may be able to utilize different food supplies, whereas intermediates may not be able to adjust. Selection against intermediates would result, due to the decrease in available preferred food. For example, black-bellied seedcracker finches with small beaks crack soft seeds more easily than those with larger beaks. Finches with large beaks crack hard seeds more easily than those with smaller beaks. Finches with intermediate-sized beaks crack both types of seeds poorly. Therefore, there is a shift in the population to the extremes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Balancing Selection&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="0" src="http://c.gigcount.com/wildfire/IMP/CXNID=2000002.0NXC/bT*xJmx*PTEzMDgwODM5OTIzNzgmcHQ9MTMwODA4Mzk5NTE4MiZwPTIwNjQyMSZkPWIyMTEyNDg2Jmc9MiZvPTk2NjhhNGRlZDA4/NDRmNzlhYTY1ZTI4N2RlOTA2Y2E4Jm9mPTA=.gif" style="visibility: hidden; width: 0px; height: 0px;" width="0" /&gt;&lt;object align="" height="480" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="640"&gt;&lt;param name="quality" value="high" /&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2112486" /&gt;&lt;param name="wmode" value="transparent" /&gt;&lt;embed height="480" hspace="10" quality="high" src="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2112486" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" vspace="10" width="640" wmode="transparent"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Balancing selection&lt;/strong&gt; works to maintain a dynamic state of balance between advantageous and disadvantageous alleles. At first this may sound contradictory, however, think about the sickle-cell allele. You learned that individuals that are heterozygous for the allele show an increase in fitness when living in areas of high malaria infestation. Because these individuals are more fit, the allele persists even though the individuals that are homozygous for the allele have a marked disadvantage. At the population level, the sickle-cell allele is advantageous even though individuals with homozygous alleles are at a disadvantage. The &lt;strong&gt;heterozygotic advantage&lt;/strong&gt; keeps the allele in the population via balancing selection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another example of balancing selection is &lt;strong&gt;frequency-dependent selection&lt;/strong&gt;. This type of selection is very widespread among traits that affect predator-prey relationships. If a trait provides the prey with an ability to avoid predation, then individuals with this trait can avoid predation and their fitness is increased. However, in many instances predators can adapt to changes in prey characteristics. If the prey allele frequency becomes high for such a trait, then there is a greater chance that more predators will have adapted to this avoidance trait and it will no longer increase fitness of the prey. The allele only endows an increase in fitness in the prey population if it is maintained in the population at a low level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Sexual Selection&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sexual selection&lt;/strong&gt; describes the selection of a mate based on a specific heritable trait; therefore, it is not a mode of natural selection. Specifically, sexual selection is based on secondary sexual characteristics (e.g., coloration or behavior). This type of selection usually leads to the enhancement of &lt;strong&gt;sexual dimorphism&lt;/strong&gt; (differences in the secondary sex characteristics) between males and females. For example, think of the peacock and its feathers; female peahens are more likely to mate with males bearing long, brightly colored tail feathers (although these feathers are not directly related to reproduction in any way). Also, the peacock&amp;#39;s tail feathers are not a survival advantage; rather, they probably make the peacock more vulnerable to predation and they take a lot of energy to maintain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table style="width: 400px;"&gt;
	&lt;tbody&gt;
		&lt;tr&gt;
			&lt;th&gt;Peahen, female pea fowl&lt;/th&gt;
			&lt;th&gt;Peacock, male pea fowl&lt;/th&gt;
		&lt;/tr&gt;
		&lt;tr&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;&lt;span class="lightbox"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 5.  Peahen with pea fowl" class="lightbox" src="assets/Tutorial%2011%20Figure%205%20Peahen.jpg" style="float: left; width: 270px; height: 207px; margin: 10px;" title="Figure 5.  Peahen with pea fowl" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;&lt;span class="lightbox"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 6. Peacock" class="lightbox" src="assets/Tutorial%2011%20Figure%206%20Peacock.jpg" style="float: ; width: 270px; height: 203px; margin: 10px;" title="Figure 6. Peacock" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
		&lt;/tr&gt;
	&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to point out that sexual selection and natural selection are different in one important aspect. Natural selection increases the adaptation of a population to a specific set of environmental conditions, whereas sexual selection does not. However, both are forms of selection because they act to screen certain alleles from a population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 7.  Comparasion between male &amp; female beetles" src="assets/Tutorial11_Figure%207%20Beetles-1.jpg" style="height: 267px; width: 400px;" title="Figure 7.  Comparasion between male &amp; female beetles" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 8.  Fantail Darter Fish" src="assets/Tutorial%2011%20Figure%208%20fantaildarter.jpg" style="height: 300px; width: 400px;" title="Figure 8.  Fantail Darter Fish" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other examples of secondary sexual characteristics and sexual dimorphism include the male lion&amp;#39;s mane, the bright colors of the male cardinal and male blue jay, and the striking sexual differences in the gigantic beetles &lt;em&gt;Macrodontia cervicornis&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Dynastes hercules&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;Another example of sexual selection is observed in fantail darter fish (&lt;em&gt;Etheostoma flabellare&lt;/em&gt;). Females show a mating preference toward males that are already guarding eggs. This behavior is presumably a result of males demonstrating their ability to protect eggs to maturity. As an effect of this behavior, some males appear with modified epidermal cells that look like fleshy knobs on their dorsal fins. These fleshy knobs mimic eggs in shape and color. Females have shown mating preference for males displaying these egg mimics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Summary&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="0" src="http://c.gigcount.com/wildfire/IMP/CXNID=2000002.0NXC/bT*xJmx*PTEzMDgwODQxNDU3MTkmcHQ9MTMwODA4NDE2ODEyNiZwPTIwNjQyMSZkPWIyMTEyNTIxJmc9MiZvPTk2NjhhNGRlZDA4/NDRmNzlhYTY1ZTI4N2RlOTA2Y2E4Jm9mPTA=.gif" style="visibility: hidden; width: 0px; height: 0px;" width="0" /&gt;&lt;object align="" height="480" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="640"&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2112521" /&gt;&lt;param name="wmode" value="transparent" /&gt;&lt;embed height="480" hspace="10" src="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2112521" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" vspace="10" width="640" wmode="transparent"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Natural selection is one of the most important concepts of evolution because it explains how organisms can adapt to a contemporary environment, as well as to another environment at a later time. Keep in mind that natural selection is not a goal-oriented process, in the sense that organisms &quot;know&quot; their evolutionary trajectory. It does not lead to a &quot;perfect organism,&quot; but it does explain how the best-adapted organisms in a given situation will propagate their genes with greater likelihood to the next generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Natural selection only works if variation exists in the population. Genetic mutation is one source of variation, however, a specific mutation does not arise on demand. Rather, variation is random, but selection is adaptive; beneficial and deleterious alleles arise spontaneously, but only the beneficial alleles will be propagated over successive generations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does this mean that every allele is under selection? Not necessarily. Indeed, many alleles may be neither beneficial nor detrimental and so, their frequency may only change due to random events. Do not think that every alternative allele is always under selection; some may be neutral (although if conditions change, a neutral allele may become either beneficial or detrimental and subject to natural selection).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon we&amp;#39;ll turn our attention from microevolution to macroevolution, the process that governs large-scale changes. But first, we&amp;#39;ll take time to consider what makes a group of organisms a species, and some current ideas about how to define species.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <title>What is a Species?</title>
    <body>&lt;h2&gt;Terms&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should have a working knowledge of the following terms:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table class="confluenceTable"&gt;
	&lt;tbody&gt;
		&lt;tr&gt;
			&lt;td class="confluenceTd"&gt;
				&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;adaptive radiation&lt;/li&gt;

				&lt;/ul&gt;
			&lt;/td&gt;

					&lt;li&gt;temporal isolation&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;/ul&gt;
			&lt;/td&gt;
		&lt;/tr&gt;
	&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Introduction and Goals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The term &quot;species&quot; (defined in &lt;a href="https://online.science.psu.edu/biol110_sandbox_2381/node/8918"&gt;Genes and Populations&lt;/a&gt;) refers to a fundamental taxonomic unit. All living organisms have a species classification, and most of us are pretty comfortable using the term &quot;species.&quot; However, actually pinpointing what makes one group of organisms distinct from another group can be difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New species primarily arise from a subpopulation of an existing species. In this process, a new species arises and the new and parental species coexist. Thus, biological diversity increases because where there once was one species, there are now two. However, at what point has the new group diverged enough from the existing group (&lt;strong&gt;speciation&lt;/strong&gt;) to form a population that we can comfortably refer to as a new species?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evolutionary biologists are still debating about how to accurately define a species. As you will learn, the problem is that not all definitions work in every situation (and perhaps this statement itself provides insight into the diversity of life). We will explore a variety of species concepts. By the end of this tutorial you should have a basic understanding of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The three major species concepts&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The difference between prezygotic and postzygotic reproductive isolation, and how both keep species distinct&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The conditions that favor speciation&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The distinction between allopatric and sympatric speciation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;What is a Species?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Numerous concepts have been proposed to define a species, however, only three concepts will be described in this tutorial. None are perfect, but the biological species concept is the most applicable. According to the &lt;em&gt;biological species concept&lt;/em&gt;, a species is a group of individuals who interbreed or have the potential to interbreed in nature. By this definition, a new species exists when individuals of a population become sufficiently different and can no longer interbreed. This very useful definition does have its limitations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;morphological species concept&lt;/em&gt; defines a species as a group of individuals with shared morphologies (appearances). In other words, if a group of organisms appears distinct from other groups, it constitutes a separate species. According to this definition, however, one might group all little brown birds into one species, or one might create dozens of species out of &lt;em&gt;Canis familiaris&lt;/em&gt;, the dog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;object align="" data="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2115561" height="480" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="640"&gt;&lt;param name="quality" value="high" /&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2115561" /&gt;&lt;param name="wmode" value="transparent" /&gt;&lt;embed height="480" hspace="10" quality="high" src="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2115561" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" vspace="10" width="640" wmode="transparent"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;evolutionary species concept&lt;/em&gt; (also known as the phylogenetic species concept) groups organisms based on shared evolutionary history. According to this definition, two species might actually be able to interbreed, yet because they have different histories they are considered different species. The problem with this concept is that it can be difficult to know the complete history of a species. As you might gather, it can be difficult to establish at what point genetically distinct populations become their own species, and in some cases the designation of a species can be somewhat arbitrary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most biologists apply the biological species concept when it is practical; when not, they turn to one of the other concepts.&lt;img border="0" height="0" src="http://c.gigcount.com/wildfire/IMP/CXNID=2000002.0NXC/bT*xJmx*PTEzMDgzNDMxMDIwNDQmcHQ9MTMwODM*MzEwNTA1OCZwPTIwNjQyMSZkPWIyMTE1NTYxJmc9MiZvPTk2NjhhNGRlZDA4/NDRmNzlhYTY1ZTI4N2RlOTA2Y2E4Jm9mPTA=.gif" style="visibility: hidden; width: 0px; height: 0px;" width="0" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a species is defined as a group of potentially interbreeding populations, then it is necessary to determine what prevents certain groups of organisms from interbreeding. Is it a different anatomy, behavior, time available for mating, or some other barrier that separates populations into species? Ultimately, some form of &lt;strong&gt;reproductive isolation&lt;/strong&gt; is involved. Reproductive isolation can be categorized according to whether the barrier blocks fertilization (a &lt;strong&gt;prezygotic barrier&lt;/strong&gt;) or prevents complete development after a &lt;strong&gt;hybrid&lt;/strong&gt; (an individual derived from two species) zygote has been formed (a &lt;strong&gt;postzygotic barrier&lt;/strong&gt;). The figure in the upper left corner summarizes how different isolation mechanisms can prevent interbreeding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Reproductive Isolation - Prezygotic Isolation&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="lightbox"&gt;&lt;a assets/tutorial12_Figure 1 Isolation Mechanisms.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 1. Isolation Mechanisms" class="lightbox" src="assets/tutorial12_Figure%201%20Isolation%20Mechanisms.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 140px; margin: 10px;" title="Figure 1. Isolation Mechanisms" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prezygotic barriers to reproduction include habitat, timing, behavior, and gametic isolation. In the case of &lt;em&gt;habitat isolation&lt;/em&gt;, two species may occupy an overlapping territory but use different habitats. For example, seven lizard species from a single genus live in close proximity within forested areas of the Dominican Republic. However, one of these lizards (&lt;em&gt;Anolis distichus&lt;/em&gt;) prefers sunny perches close to the ground; another (&lt;em&gt;A. cybotes&lt;/em&gt;) perches in shady, mid-level tree branches. Occupying these separate microhabitats, as depicted in this figure, prevents them from interacting physically, therefore, hybrids are rarely produced. Habitat isolation is also used in breeding programs; cat fanciers who raise and sell Himalayans would not want their female cats in the same room with male alley cats. Two species that are receptive to mating at different times of the day exhibit &lt;em&gt;temporal isolation&lt;/em&gt;. For example, the eastern spotted skunk and the western spotted skunk have overlapping ranges, but they do not produce hybrids because the western variety mates in the summer and the eastern variety mates in the winter. Similarly, there are many flower species that don&amp;#39;t interbreed because they flower at different times of the day, season, or year, thus they cannot cross-pollinate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Eastern Meadowlark&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="lightbox"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 2. Eastern Meadowlark" class="lightbox" src="assets/tutorial12_Figure%203%20Eastern%20Meadowlark.jpg" style="width: 270px; height: 200px; margin: 0px;" title="Figure 2. Eastern Meadowlark" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/eastern_meadowlark/sounds"&gt;Listen to the Eastern meadowlark&amp;#39;s call.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Western Meadowlark&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="lightbox"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 3. Western Meadowlark" class="lightbox" src="assets/tutorial12_Figure%204%20Western%20Meadowlark.jpg" style="width: 270px; height: 326px; margin: 10px;" title="Figure 3. Western Meadowlark" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/western_meadowlark/sounds"&gt;Listen to the Western Meadowlark&amp;#39;s call&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Groups of organisms that do not interbreed because they exhibit different behaviors exhibit &lt;em&gt;behavioral isolation&lt;/em&gt;. Eastern and western meadowlarks are difficult to distinguish between based on size, shape, and color, however, their calls are quite distinct. Presumably this difference serves to distinguish mates from the different species. Click on the icon beside each bird to hear its song. Can you detect a difference? Behavioral isolation may also prevent different firefly populations from mating because different species have their own pattern of light pulses. Other examples include mating dances and various courtship rituals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gametic isolation&lt;/em&gt; is prezygotic isolation in the most literal sense. Here, gametes do not form a zygote; for any number of reasons (morphological, chemical, or environmental), the fusion of gametes does not occur.&lt;br class="atl-forced-newline" /&gt;
	Finally, in instances of &lt;em&gt;mechanical isolation&lt;/em&gt;, differences in size and shape of genitalia (or flower structures) prevent successful mating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Reproductive Isolation - Postzygotic Isolation&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="lightbox"&gt;&lt;a assets/tutorial12_Figure 1 Isolation Mechanisms.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 4. Isolation Mechanisms Can Prevent Inbreeding" class="lightbox" src="assets/tutorial12_Figure%201%20Isolation%20Mechanisms.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 140px; margin: 10px;" title="Figure 4. Isolation Mechanisms Can Prevent Inbreeding" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of postzygotic reproductive isolation, individuals from two species are capable of producing a zygote, however, these offspring (or their offspring) are incapable of normal growth and/or reproduction. Postzygotic barriers to hybridization include reduced hybrid viability, reduced hybrid fertility, and hybrid breakdown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;reduced hybrid viability&lt;/em&gt;, hybrids lack vigor and rarely, if ever, reach sexual maturity. These offspring are considered nonviable because ultimately, they are unable to reproduce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;reduced hybrid fertility&lt;/em&gt;, interbreeding between species occurs and hybrids are formed, however, the hybrids themselves are usually sterile. Reduced fertility is observed in mules, which are sterile hybrids of donkeys and horses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;object align="" data="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2117558" height="480" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="640"&gt;&lt;param name="quality" value="high" /&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2117558" /&gt;&lt;param name="wmode" value="transparent" /&gt;&lt;embed height="480" hspace="10" quality="high" src="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2117558" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" vspace="10" width="640" wmode="transparent"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conditions that Favor Speciation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we have addressed several mechanisms that keep species from interbreeding, we will focus on some theories about how new species arise (&lt;strong&gt;speciation&lt;/strong&gt;). Essentially, gene flow between closely related populations must be interrupted. This can happen in one of two ways. &lt;strong&gt;Allopatric speciation&lt;/strong&gt; occurs when populations become physically isolated due to some sort of geographical barrier. &lt;strong&gt;Sympatric speciation&lt;/strong&gt; occurs when populations become genetically isolated, even though their ranges overlap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As suggested, allopatric speciation involves some sort of geographical isolation that physically blocks migration of individuals (or gene flow) between populations. Geographical isolation may arise as a result of changes in water flow, volcanic uprisings, canyon formations, or other landmass changes. A good example of allopatric speciation involves two species of antelope squirrels whose populations are separated by the Grand Canyon. Presumably they evolved from once-interbreeding populations that were isolated by the formation of the canyon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adaptive radiation&lt;/strong&gt; refers to the relatively rapid evolution of many new species from a single common ancestor into diverse habitats. Adaptive radiation is commonly observed on island chains where new opportunities exist for immigrant species. Examples include the speciation of Darwin&amp;#39;s finches in the Galapagos chain of islands, the diversification of honeycreepers in the Hawaiian islands, and the radiation of cichlid fish around the globe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sympatric Speciation in Plants&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sympatric speciation is extremely common in plants. In plants, it is not unusual for errors in cell division (mitosis or meiosis) to produce gametes with an extra set of chromosomes. Fertilization of one of these gametes results is a condition called &lt;strong&gt;polyploidy&lt;/strong&gt;. Polyploid individuals cannot interbreed successfully with diploid plants of the parent population, thus resulting in a type of gametic isolation. In this manner, speciation can occur quite rapidly (in one generation) within a sympatric population of plants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;object align="" data="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2117565" height="480" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="640"&gt;&lt;param name="quality" value="high" /&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2117565" /&gt;&lt;param name="wmode" value="transparent" /&gt;&lt;embed height="480" hspace="10" quality="high" src="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2117565" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" vspace="10" width="640" wmode="transparent"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tutorial explored the species concept. A species is the fundamental taxonomic unit, but how this unit is defined is a bit slippery. Paradoxically, the diversity of life itself leads to imprecision in defining exactly what constitutes a species; what works well for one group may be impractical for another. At one level this argument may seem like splitting hairs. After all, a dog is a dog, and a cat is a cat; you don&amp;#39;t have to be a trained biologist to recognize the difference. However, the species is a fundamental unit of evolution; how can we tell if evolution is occurring if we can&amp;#39;t define a species? The available data indicate that most new species arise from existing species, in a process known as cladogenesis. Cladogenesis can be thought of as the &quot;budding&quot; of one species from another. Basically, a small group undergoes sufficient genetic changes to become a new species and coexist, at least for awhile, with the parental species. How much does a group have to change in order for it to be categorized as a &quot;new&quot; species? The answer depends on how one defines a species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although biologists have yet to come up with the best definition for a species, there are three major definitions in use today: the biological species concept, the morphological species concept, and the evolutionary species concept. The biological species concept is probably the most widely used of the three, but it is not always used; the other two can be more applicable in certain instances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biological species concept defines a species as a group of individuals who interbreed, or have the potential to interbreed, in nature. Notice that this definition is very similar to the definition of a population. In fact, recall that microevolution works at the population level. According to the biological species concept, when individuals of a population become sufficiently different, so as to lose the capacity to interbreed, then a new species has arisen. This definition works well for groups of individuals that reproduce sexually, but is not very useful for those that do not undergo sexual reproduction. It also is not useful in defining groups that are extinct, and can prove problematic in defining groups of bacteria that undergo conjugation (the exchange of small amounts of genetic information).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The morphological species concept defines a species as the smallest groups that are consistently and persistently distinct and distinguishable by ordinary means. In other words, if they appear different, then they are different species. The advantage of this definition is that it works for extinct species and for those that reproduce asexually. However, it can be insufficient. For example, if you were not familiar with dogs and came upon a group of Chihuahua dogs, you might define dogs as &quot;small, four-legged, warm-blooded animals with prominent canine teeth.&quot; If you then came upon a group of Great Danes, you could easily classify them as a second species due to their large size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The evolutionary species concept strives to distinguish a species based on its evolutionary history. It defines a species as a group of individuals who share at least one common diagnostic feature and are on a unique evolutionary path. Moreover, this feature can be biochemical or morphological but it must be heritable and reproducible between the members of the groups (the species). Note that in this definition, two individuals from distinct species may have the capacity to interbreed, but yet be considered distinct because they lack a critical derived character trait that defines the two species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might be wondering, if biologists cannot agree on what constitutes a species, how do they know speciation occurs? This is a reasonable question. The answer reveals the robust character of evolutionary theory because there are many documented cases where all three definitions apply to two groups; therefore, regardless of the definition used, biologists can reasonably conclude that speciation has, and continues, to take place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biological species concept is useful in defining a species among contemporary groups that reproduce sexually. In thinking about how speciation occurs, a critical component is reproductive isolation. If two populations of the same species become separated over time, microevolutionary changes will occur and eventually these populations will become reproductively isolated. Typically this happens when a small group becomes isolated from a larger parental group. Once isolated, gene flow between the two groups ceases. Recall, small populations are highly susceptible to microevolutionary changes, which is probably why cladogenesis seems to be a common feature of speciation. There are a number of ways that two groups can become reproductively isolated. These reproductive isolation events can be classified as prezygotic (habitat, behavioral, temporal, mechanical, and gametic isolation) or postzygotic (hybrid viability, hybrid fertility, and hybrid breakdown). Geographic isolation can play a significant role in isolating one population of a species from another. When speciation occurs in separate geographical locations, the pattern is described as allopatric speciation. However, there are instances when reproductive isolation takes place in the same geographic locale; in these cases, the event is termed sympatric speciation. Sympatric speciation is more common in plants and relatively rare in animals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, we will continue our discussion of speciation on a broader scale, by addressing the processes that govern large-scale changes among organisms.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <title>Mechanisms of Macroevolution</title>
    <body>&lt;h1&gt;Terms&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should have a working knowledge of the following terms:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;allometric growth&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;exaptation&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;heterochrony&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;homeosis&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;homeotic genes&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;paedomorphosis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Introduction and Goals&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previously we examined microevolutionary events that account for changes in allele frequencies between generations within a population. For example, microevolutionary events can account for changes in the beak size of finches, but what about more pronounced changes? How does evolution explain the appearance of wings, lungs, or for that matter, bird beaks themselves? The answer to how major changes come about is complex and involves developmental events. By the conclusion of this tutorial you should have a basic understanding of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The distinction between a microevolutionary event and a macroevolutionary event&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;How genes can affect the timing of developmental events and the misplacement of organs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Macroevolution&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;This figure shows the similarities between embryos of a dog, an alligator, and a human. Note how similar they are at this early stage of development. Can you identify the human? Obviously, later on in development you wouldn&amp;#39;t have this difficulty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/courses/biol110/sites/edu.courses.biol110/files/images/Tutorial14_MM_Figure1VertebrateEmbryos.jpg" id="Figure 1. Vertebrate Embryos" title="Figure 1. Vertebrate Embryos"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 1. Vertebrate Embryos" src="assets/Tutorial14_MM_Figure1VertebrateEmbryos.jpg" title="Figure 1. Vertebrate Embryos" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This sequence of embryos shows that all vertebrates share a common set of genes that are expressed similarly during early development. As development progresses, however, different genes are expressed in different ways; the net result at birth is three very different phenotypes, each having the unique characteristics of their respective species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simply stated, those genes whose expression distinguish one species from other species are genes that affect one or more macroevolutionary processes. In other words, microevolution describes changes in the genetic makeup within a species, whereas macroevolution describes changes in the genetic makeup between species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Macroevolution, as the name implies, describes big changes, hence they are of great interest to evolutionary biologists. However, it would be a mistake to think that major structures (e.g., wings, legs, beaks) arose at a given instant in time. Fossil records support the idea that these modern structures have their ancestral roots in far more primitive structures. For example, many changes likely contributed to the form of bird wings, and there were many macroevoutionary events that gave rise to the modern bird wings observed today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many evolutionary biologists think that modern birds evolved from a dinosaur lineage. There are many lines of evidence to support this idea. One such line of evidence is the presence of wings (and feathers) on some dinosaur fossils. However, the ancestral function of feathers probably did not include flight. Structures that arise and are used in one context but in another context have different or additional functions, are termed &lt;strong&gt;exaptations&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Development and Evolution (aka Evo-Devo)&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Changes in the genes that control development are very significant in macroevolution. At first this may seem counter intuitive because development describes irreversible changes in an organism from fertilization to death, whereas evolution describes changes in populations between generations. How then do evolutionary biologists attribute developmental events to explain macroevolution?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer is that some genes that affect critical developmental processes, after mutation, result in dramatic phenotypic changes. As you will learn, mutations in these critical genes, which are expressed early in development, can profoundly affect the adult phenotype.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially it was thought by evo-devo researchers (those who study the role that development plays in evolution) that these mutations resulted in &quot;hopeful monsters.&quot; It was proposed, that in a single step, a mutation in a developmental gene could result in a new species. This idea is no longer held by most workers in the field. Instead, available data indicate that a series of changes, in one or more developmentally significant genes, can gradually lead to macroevolutionay events that give rise to a new species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Different classes of developmental genes can have major affects on an organism. Keep in mind that none of these events necessarily result in macroevolution; rather, they may contribute, in various ways, to the appearance of a new species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Homeotic Genes&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 2. Homeosis" src="assets/Tutorial14_MM_Figure2Homeosis.jpg" style="height: 210px; width: 300px;" title="Figure 2. Homeosis" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Homeotic genes&lt;/strong&gt; determine the placement of body parts. Most insects have two pairs of wings, however, flies have one set of flying wings and one set of small balancing wings (halteres). A single mutation in the gene bithorax will result in a fly with two complete sets of flying wings (shown here). This mutation results in an organ appearing in the wrong place. The general term for any mutation that results in a misplaced organ is &lt;strong&gt;homeosis&lt;/strong&gt;. Another homeotic mutation in flies includes the trait of legs growing out of eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All animals, including humans, have homeotic genes. One of the most evolutionarily conserved homeotic genes is the hox gene. The various alleles of this gene can have a profound influence on development. In the next two questions you will explore how mutations in the human hox gene can affect human development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Heterochrony&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;Development is a progressive process, therefore, it should not surprise you that certain developmental genes regulate the timing of certain events. There are a variety of genes whose mutant alleles alter the timing of various developmental events. Just as homeotic genes alter the position of an organ, these developmental genes alter when things happen. &lt;strong&gt;Heterochrony&lt;/strong&gt; refers to an alteration in time, or a change in order, of one or more events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 1. Isolation Mechanisms" src="assets/tutorial12_Figure%201%20Isolation%20Mechanisms.jpg" style="height: 280px; width: 600px;" title="Figure 1. Isolation Mechanisms" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;There are various types of heterochronic alterations. For example, &lt;strong&gt;paedomorphosis&lt;/strong&gt; describes a condition in which the timing of sexual maturity is altered (compared to the parental group). The result is a morphologically juvenile individual that is sexually mature and capable of reproduction. Some salamanders are paedomorphic; the axolotl (shown here) can grow to full size and reproduce even though it looks larval. (It retains its gills and other juvenile features, including living in the water.) In this way, adult axolotls can look very different from closely related salamanders that undergo complete maturation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 3. Axolotl" src="assets/Tutorial14_MM_Figure3Axolotl.jpg" title="Figure 3. Axolotl" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Allometric Growth&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;Growth is the irreversible increase in volume. In some cases the growth of different organ parts is isometric, resulting in a mature organ that has the same shape as it had in the juvenile state. However, many organs show disproportionate growth (&lt;strong&gt;allometric growth&lt;/strong&gt;). In allometric growth, not all parts of the organ and/or organism grow at the same rate. The result is an adult structure that is shaped differently than the juvenile structure, exemplified by many human secondary sex characteristics. The genetic basis of allometric growth involves differential timing of genes; therefore, allometric growth is a form of heterochrony.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 4. Allometric Growth" src="assets/Tutorial14_MM_Figure4AllometricGrowth.jpg" style="height: 268px; width: 400px;" title="Figure 4. Allometric Growth" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allometric growth can occur at the cell, tissue, organ, and organismal level. The first left figure depicts growth proportions of the human body. As one can see, many features exhibit allometric growth. For example, at birth the head is about 25% of the body&amp;#39;s length, but at maturity it is about 12% (or less) of its length. Also, note that extremities grow disproportionately. The other figure depicts changes in the shape of human and chimp skulls during development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 5. Skull Growth" src="assets/Tutorial14_MM_Figure5SkullGrowth.jpg" title="Figure 5. Skull Growth" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Earth&amp;#39;s Life History is Marked by Macroevolutionary Changes&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;These figures display the eras in the Earth&amp;#39;s history (the geological time scale will be discussed in future tutorials). The Cambrian period (570 - 505 million years ago) represents a relatively small window of time (geologically speaking), but most modern groups of animals appear in the fossil record in the beginning of the Cambrian period. Indeed, the period is defined by a tremendous &quot;explosion&quot; of new species. In this period (545-525 million year ago), animals diversified rapidly. Fossil evidence suggests that some of these animals were unlike anything roaming Earth today. Below is an artist&amp;#39;s rendition of what the ancient oceans might have looked like during the early Ordovician, which followed the Cambrian explosion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 6. Geological Time" src="assets/Tutorial14_MM_Figure6GeologicalTime.jpg" style="height: 243px; width: 600px;" title="Figure 6. Geological Time" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;It is not clear why this incredible diversity of animals appeared at this time in Earth&amp;#39;s history. Some evolutionary biologists think that this period marked the beginnings of complex predator/prey relationships. The predator&amp;#39;s motility and sensory apparatuses became more complex, and the adaptive &quot;response&quot; of prey involved a similar increase in sophistication to counter these measures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 7. Geological Time" src="assets/Tutorial14_MM_Figure7GeologicalTime.jpg" title="Figure 7. Geological Time" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;Although the reason for such a great diversification is debated, it is clear that during the Cambrian explosion macroevolution was taking place on a grand scale. Bilaterally symmetrical animals were prominent for the first time, as were segmented, highly mobile organisms. As a matter of fact, the half-billion years since have shown morphological changes that are simply refinements of these Cambrian body plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 8. UC Berkeley Display" src="assets/Tutorial14_MMFigure8UCBerkeleyDisplay.jpg" title="Figure 8. UC Berkeley Display" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most abundant sources of fossils from the Cambrian period was discovered in British Columbia and is known as &lt;a class="external-link" href="http://www.geo.ucalgary.ca/%7Emacrae/Burgess_Shale/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="the Burgess Shale"&gt;the Burgess Shale&lt;/a&gt;. This site, now designated as a World Heritage Site, provides the best examples of fossils from the Cambrian explosion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="0" src="http://c.gigcount.com/wildfire/IMP/CXNID=2000002.0NXC/bT*xJmx*PTEzMDgzNjIxNzYxODUmcHQ9MTMwODM2MjE4MTcxMCZwPTIwNjQyMSZkPWIyMTE3Nzc4Jmc9MiZvPTk2NjhhNGRlZDA4/NDRmNzlhYTY1ZTI4N2RlOTA2Y2E4Jm9mPTA=.gif" style="visibility: hidden; width: 0px; height: 0px;" width="0" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Summary&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some rare instances, macroevolutionary events occur abruptly and give rise to a new species. However, many evolutionary biologists think that the majority of speciation events occur over extended time periods. Hence, many, if not most species, arise gradually as microevolutionary events accumulate until such a time as new opportunities cause isolating events (e.g., adaptive radiation).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;object align="" data="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2117778" height="480" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="640"&gt;&lt;param name="quality" value="high" /&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2117778" /&gt;&lt;param name="wmode" value="transparent" /&gt;&lt;embed height="480" hspace="10" quality="high" src="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2117778" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" vspace="10" width="640" wmode="transparent"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although macroevolutionary events play a defining role in speciation, microevolutionary events, acting over extended periods of time (especially with strong selection), may contribute to macroevolutionary changes. The underlying genetic processes of microevolution and macroevolution are the same. However, some genetic changes (e.g., alteration in pivotal developmental processes) are more likely to result in a rapid and dramatic change in the phenotype, which will result more quickly in a new species. For example, a heterochronic mutation event, in which certain members who carry the altered allele can reproduce earlier in life, may confer a selective advantage and the allele will increase in frequency over time (microevolution). At some later point an isolation event may separate these early reproducers from late reproducers and, over time, the two populations may drift apart and fill separate niches; over hundreds or thousands of generations, the two populations may become incapable of interbreeding and a new species arises (macroevolution).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data indicate that macroevolution rarely happens in one giant step. Wings likely arose over an extended period of time, in a stepwise fashion. Lastly, evolution has no predestined pathway. For example, the fossil evidence indicates that feathered limbs appeared before flight; only later did feathers appear on wings. This example of exaptation, in which feathers arose in one context and later became adapted for an additional function, is common. In other words, evolution largely works on existing structures and processes. Through the process of natural selection, new ways of adapting old structures to new conditions allow certain populations to be come better adapted to a new environment, and hence become more fit. Over time, with repeated selection, these changes can become significantly different, so as to appear as major features of a new species.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

&lt;h2&gt;Introduction and Goals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life is composed of a myriad of biomolecules (molecules found in living organisms). With all of life&amp;#39;s diversity, however, there is a ubiquitous presence of carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen. Carbon plays a particularly important role in these molecules by virtue of its unique chemical properties. In this tutorial you will learn why some biomolecules readily interact with water, and why some do not. We will examine how relatively simple subunits, monomers, can be hooked together by chemical bonds to make much larger complex macromolecules, polymers. By the end of this tutorial you should have a basic working understanding of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The basic properties of water, and its influence on biomolecules&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The basic properties of lipids, carbohydrates, proteins, and nucleic acids&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Carbon&amp;#39;s importance to life&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Properties of Water&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Water (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) is fundamental to the existence of life as we know it. Indeed, it is so familiar to us that we take its properties for granted. What makes water so important? Why does water exist? What is the relationship between water and other biomolecules? In order to answer these questions we need to take a close look at water and at some of the subatomic properties of its electrons, which have a profound influence on its character.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 1. Hydrogen bonds between water molecules." src="assets/tutorial16_hydrogen_bonds.jpg" style="height: 309px; width: 400px;" title="Figure 1. Hydrogen bonds between water molecules." /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you probably learned in elementary school, a single molecule of water consists of two hydrogen atoms covalently bound to one oxygen atom. This arrangement does not sound very exciting, however, a closer examination of the bonds within the water molecule reveals something unique. Specifically, water is a &lt;strong&gt;polar&lt;/strong&gt; molecule, meaning that it has different electrical properties on opposite ends; specifically, it has two partial positive charges in association with the two H-atoms, and two partial negative charges associated with the oxygen atom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand these electrical properties, you need to know that not all &lt;strong&gt;covalent bonds&lt;/strong&gt; (those bonds that involve the sharing of electrons) are equal. Specifically, oxygen tends to pull electrons close to itself when forming covalent bonds with hydrogen. This creates an unequal distribution around each O-H bond; therefore, the hydrogen has a partial positive charge (and conversely, the oxygen has a slightly negative character). Importantly, the partial negative charges on one water molecule can interact with the partial positive charges on another water molecule to form a &lt;strong&gt;hydrogen bond&lt;/strong&gt; (as shown in Figure 1 with dotted lines). Hydrogen bonds contribute to many of the unique features of water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;More About Water&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;The state in which liquid water molecules are stuck together, via H-bonding, gives water a physical property termed &lt;strong&gt;cohesion&lt;/strong&gt;. Due to cohesion, water has a high &lt;strong&gt;surface tension&lt;/strong&gt;(resistance to disruption at the surface). This property is exploited by many insects (e.g., the stone fly pictured above) and some vertebrates (e.g., the basilisk lizard), which can actually stand or run on water without breaking the surface and falling through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 2. Surface tension of water.  A stonefly stands on water." src="assets/tutorial16_surface_tension.jpg" title="Figure 2. Surface tension of water.  A stonefly stands on water." /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Water is a repository for heat due to its high &lt;strong&gt;specific heat&lt;/strong&gt;. This means that it takes a relatively large amount of energy to raise the temperature of water. Therefore, water absorbs (and stores) heat energy more efficiently than many other substances. Biologically, this is extremely important because large bodies of water tend to have relatively stable temperatures, whereas the air around them may fluctuate. The moderate temperatures in oceans and large lakes make them suitable year-round for an abundance of aquatic life. Water also has a relatively high &lt;strong&gt;heat of vaporization&lt;/strong&gt;, therefore, water is relatively resistant to phase changes. (It takes a relatively large amount of energy to break all of the H-bonds in water to produce water vapor or steam.) This property allows some organisms to use water, in the form of sweat, to cool down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 3.  The structure of ice compared with the structure of water." src="assets/tutorial16_ice_water.jpg" style="height: 386px; width: 600px;" title="Figure 3.  The structure of ice compared with the structure of water." /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Water expands during freezing. When water molecules slow down and ice forms (below freezing), the hydrogen bonds keep water molecules at a distance from each other in a characteristic, 3-dimensional crystal that is relatively spacious. The distinction between ice and liquid water is illustrated in this figure, which also depicts how this arrangement makes ice less dense than water, thereby allowing ice to float on water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Water is an excellent &lt;strong&gt;solvent&lt;/strong&gt;, capable of dissolving many compounds. The polar character of water means that anything with a charge can dissolve in water. NaCl is table salt, and when added to water its sodium and chloride atoms disassociate. These ions have a charge. Both the positively charged sodium ions (Na+) and negatively charged chloride ions (Cl-) can readily bond to the polar water molecules, and in doing so they dissolve. Compounds that dissolve readily in water are &lt;strong&gt;hydrophilic&lt;/strong&gt;. Compounds that do not interact with water are &lt;strong&gt;hydrophobic&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, water has many important properties that are important to life. The cells of terrestrial organisms (including ours) contain greater than 70% water, and most cells are surrounded by water. This means that a large percentage of biomolecules operate in an aqueous compartment. It should not surprise you to learn that water plays an important role in the functioning of biochemicals. In the next few sections you will learn about four classes of biomolecules and about how their unique characteristics (and synthesis) involve water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Carbon&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world is comprised of organic and inorganic compounds. &lt;strong&gt;Inorganic compounds&lt;/strong&gt; include water and mineral rocks. An inorganic compound does not contain carbon. In contrast, &lt;strong&gt;organic compounds&lt;/strong&gt; do contain carbon and are prevalent in living systems. They provide us with colors, tastes, and odors, along with the abilities to perceive and act. In other words, carbon compounds are essential to our existence. What is it about carbon that makes it so fundamental to life on Earth?&amp;nbsp; Carbon has four &lt;strong&gt;electrons&lt;/strong&gt; (a negatively charged part of an atom) in its outermost orbital. This &lt;strong&gt;valence&lt;/strong&gt; of four allows each carbon atom to form stable associations with up to four other atoms, including other carbon atoms. Carbon can form single, double, or triple bonds. That is, it can share one, two, or three of its valence electrons with another atom. By convention, a single, double, or triple line is used to denote these different types of bonds. A single carbon atom bound to another carbon atom is the building block for a seemingly endless variety of chain- and ring-structured molecules. The two figures on this page represent a small portion of the thousands of organic compounds that exist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 4.  Organic compounds contain carbon." src="assets/tutorial16_carbon.jpg" style="height: 375px; width: 400px;" title="Figure 4.  Organic compounds contain carbon." /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;We will address four classes of large organic compounds (&lt;strong&gt;macromolecules&lt;/strong&gt;): carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids. Note that three of these (carbohydrates, proteins, and nucleic acids) are actually formed through the synthesis of many similar or identical building blocks. These building blocks (monomers) are linked to form polymers. The general process of joining monomers to form a polymer is termed &lt;strong&gt;anabolism&lt;/strong&gt;, which can involve many steps. Conversely, a polymer can be broken down into its monomers by &lt;strong&gt;catabolism&lt;/strong&gt;, which also can involve multiple steps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 5. Organic compounds occur in a variety of configurations." src="assets/tutorial16_hydrocarbons.jpg" style="height: 356px; width: 600px;" title="Figure 5. Organic compounds occur in a variety of configurations." /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;object align="bottom" data="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2120811" height="480" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="640"&gt;&lt;param name="quality" value="high" /&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2120811" /&gt;&lt;param name="wmode" value="transparent" /&gt;&lt;embed height="480" hspace="10" quality="high" src="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2120811" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" vspace="10" width="640" wmode="transparent"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hydrolysis and Condensation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0" data="https://online.science.psu.edu/sites/default/files/biol110/tutorial16_condensation_hydrolysis.swf" height="480" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="640"&gt;&lt;param name="quality" value="high" /&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="https://online.science.psu.edu/sites/default/files/biol110/tutorial16_condensation_hydrolysis.swf" /&gt;&lt;embed height="480" hspace="10" pluginspage="http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer" quality="high" src="assets/tutorial16_condensation_hydrolysis.swf" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" vspace="10" width="640"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are thousands of different types of biochemical reactions. Although they may involve the joining or breaking down of a myriad of molecules, most use the same basic chemical reaction. Anabolic reactions typically involve the joining of monomers by the removal of a water molecule. In this case an hydroxide (OH) is removed from one molecule and a hydrogen (H) is removed from the adjacent combining molecule. This type of reaction, termed &lt;strong&gt;condensation synthesis&lt;/strong&gt; (or &lt;strong&gt;dehydration synthesis&lt;/strong&gt;), is illustrated in the animation shown here. Select condensation, and hit play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This animation also depicts a &lt;strong&gt;hydrolysis&lt;/strong&gt; reaction (a type of catabolism whereby a polymer is broken down by the addition of water).&amp;nbsp; Hit the &quot;home&quot; icon to return to the beginning; select condensation and hit play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Carbohydrates&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0" data="https://online.science.psu.edu/sites/default/files/biol110/tutorial16_disaccharide_formation.swf" height="480" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="640"&gt;&lt;param name="quality" value="high" /&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="https://online.science.psu.edu/sites/default/files/biol110/tutorial16_disaccharide_formation.swf" /&gt;&lt;embed height="480" hspace="10" pluginspage="http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer" quality="high" src="assets/tutorial16_disaccharide_formation.swf" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" vspace="10" width="640"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Carbohydrate&lt;/strong&gt; biomolecules generally have a basic structural formula that is written as C(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)n. They have many functions in cells. They can be used for energy storage (e.g., starch) and as structural molecules (e.g., cellulose). They also play a role in information storage in &lt;strong&gt;nucleic acids&lt;/strong&gt; (organic compounds that make up RNA and DNA).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic monomeric units of carbohydrates are the simple sugars (&lt;strong&gt;monosaccharides&lt;/strong&gt;). Monosaccharides include glucose (also known as dextrose), fructose, ribose, galactose, and ribulose. Note, the -ose suffix is used by chemists to describe all carbohydrates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;disaccharide&lt;/strong&gt; is a sugar formed by a condensation reaction between two monosaccharides, which is shown in an animation on the right.&amp;nbsp; Condensation synthesis of maltose (glucose + glucose), a common disaccharide, is illustrated in the following animation. Other disaccharides include sucrose (glucose + fructose) and lactose (glucose + galactose); sucrose is common table sugar, and lactose is milk sugar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More complex forms of carbohydrates can be synthesized by cells via additional condensation reactions. &lt;strong&gt;Polysaccharide&lt;/strong&gt; polymers can consist of up to several thousand monomers of simple sugars. The type of polysaccharide is determined by the number, type, and arrangement of its monomers. Starch is a polymer of glucose monomers. It is used by plants to store surplus sugar. Besides being important to the physiology of plants, starch has many industrial usages. Animals store surplus sugar in the form of glycogen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 6. Exoskeleton made of chitin.  The exoskeletons of arthropods, like this fiddler crab, are made of the polysaccharide chitin." src="assets/tutorial16_fiddler_crab.jpg" title="Figure 6. Exoskeleton made of chitin.  The exoskeletons of arthropods, like this fiddler crab, are made of the polysaccharide chitin." /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;Cellulose, another polymer of glucose, is an important component of plant cell walls; it is also the most abundant polymer on the planet. Although humans cannot digest cellulose, it is a valuable part of our diet because this &quot;fiber&quot; helps to maintain a healthy digestive tract. Some animals, such as the crab shown here, and fungi use another polysaccharide, chitin, for structural purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lipids&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Lipids&lt;/strong&gt; are an assortment of molecules so diverse that it may seem odd to group them together. However, they do share one common trait; they are all (to some extent) hydrophobic. As previously stated, some lipids are amphipathic. This property is used by cells to construct membranes. Lipids can be solid (fats) or liquid (oils) at room temperature. Chemically, the difference between fats and oils is very subtle.&lt;object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0" data="https://online.science.psu.edu/sites/default/files/biol110/tutorial16_fat_synthesis.swf" height="480" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="640"&gt;&lt;param name="quality" value="high" /&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="https://online.science.psu.edu/sites/default/files/biol110/tutorial16_fat_synthesis.swf" /&gt;&lt;embed align="" height="480" hspace="10" pluginspage="http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer" quality="high" src="assets/tutorial16_fat_synthesis.swf" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" vspace="10" width="640"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 7.  Lipids - The Triacylglycerols.  Fats and oils have three fatty acid molecules (only one strand is shown here) and one glycerol molecule (not shown). Double bonds determine whether a fat is saturated or unsaturated." src="assets/tutorial16_triacylglycerols.jpg" style="height: 400px; width: 400px;" title="Figure 7.  Lipids - The Triacylglycerols.  Fats and oils have three fatty acid molecules (only one strand is shown here) and one glycerol molecule (not shown). Double bonds determine whether a fat is saturated or unsaturated." /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fats and oils are &lt;strong&gt;triacylglycerols&lt;/strong&gt;, which are formed when three fatty acid molecules and one glycerol molecule join via condensation synthesis. This animation depicts the synthesis of a triacylglycerol molecule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fats can be saturated or unsaturated. &lt;strong&gt;Saturated fats&lt;/strong&gt; do not have double bonds in their chains because their carbon is bound to two other carbons and two hydrogens. &lt;strong&gt;Unsaturated fats&lt;/strong&gt; have double bonds along their lengths (monounsaturated = one double bond, polyunsaturated = more than one double bond). Saturated fats have straight chains that organize into more tightly packed arrangements. In contrast, unsaturated fats have kinks caused by the double bonds, which do not permit tight packing. Thus, saturated fats tend to be solids at room temperature, whereas unsaturated fats are usually liquid. A liquid unsaturated fat can be converted to a solid saturated fat by a process called hydrogenation (e.g., margarine).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 8. Lipids - The Phospholipids.  Phospholipids have two fatty acid molecules, and a glycerol molecule joined to a phosphate group." src="assets/tutorial16_phospholipids.jpg" title="Figure 8. Lipids - The Phospholipids.  Phospholipids have two fatty acid molecules, and a glycerol molecule joined to a phosphate group." /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fats are used in energy storage, protection, and insulation. Aquatic and polar mammals counteract heat loss by having extra fat for insulation. Compare the Arctic polar bear and subtropical gazelle. Clearly, they don&amp;#39;t have a similar need for extra insulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 9.  Lipids - The Steroids.  Steroids are fused ring structures. Cholesterol is a steroid." src="assets/tutorial16_steroids.jpg" title="Figure 9.  Lipids - The Steroids.  Steroids are fused ring structures. Cholesterol is a steroid." /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast to the fats, &lt;strong&gt;phospholipids&lt;/strong&gt; have only two fatty acids molecules, and glycerol joined to a phosphate group. This figure depicts this arrangement of two hydrophobic &quot;tails&quot; attached to a hydrophilic &quot;head&quot; (the phosphate group is charged, allowing it to dissolve in water). This unique structure forms the basis for the phospholipid bilayer of cell membranes (a topic to be discussed in future tutorials).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another group of lipids, the &lt;strong&gt;steroids&lt;/strong&gt;, is characterized by fused ring structures (shown here). The steroids include cholesterol, and certain hormones (e.g., testosterone) produced from cholesterol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Proteins&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;object align="" data="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2120827" height="480" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="640"&gt;&lt;param name="quality" value="high" /&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2120827" /&gt;&lt;param name="wmode" value="transparent" /&gt;&lt;embed height="480" hspace="10" quality="high" src="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2120827" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" vspace="10" width="640" wmode="transparent"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Proteins&lt;/strong&gt; are functionally and structurally diverse. The digestive enzymes that break apart your food are proteins. The pigment that affects skin color, melanin, is a protein. Silk is a protein. Proteins move your muscles, attack invading bacteria and viruses, and transport oxygen to all of the cells in your body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 10. The general formula for amino acids." src="assets/tutorial16_amino_acids.jpg" title="Figure 10. The general formula for amino acids." /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic monomer of proteins is the &lt;strong&gt;amino acid&lt;/strong&gt;. The general structure of an amino acid is shown here. Note, this basic structure contains an &quot;R&quot; group that is variable in chemical composition. Typically there are twenty different R-groups, and hence the same number of commonly seen amino acids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 11.  The twenty amino acids that make up proteins.  The R-groups are found in the shaded boxes." src="assets/tutorial16_R_groups.jpg" style="height: 387px; width: 600px;" title="Figure 11.  The twenty amino acids that make up proteins.  The R-groups are found in the shaded boxes." /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This figure depicts the chemical diversity of the twenty amino acids that make up proteins. Note the &quot;R-group&quot; can be classified as nonpolar, polar, or charged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Polypeptides&lt;/strong&gt; are a polymer (chain) of amino acids. Proteins consist of one or more polypeptide chains arranged in a specific conformation. The order of amino acids in a particular polypeptide chain is determined by the specific gene for that chain. In other words, every polypeptide chain has a corresponding gene. Polypeptides are formed by the linking of the carboxyl group of one amino acid to the amino group of an adjacent amino acid.&lt;strong&gt;Peptide bond&lt;/strong&gt; formation is an example of condensation synthesis, whereby one water molecule is removed to join two amino acids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The animation shown here illustrates peptide bond formation. Do not simply think of proteins as linear strings of amino acids. In reality, they fold into a three-dimensional structure and take on complex shapes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0" data="https://online.science.psu.edu/sites/default/files/biol110/tutorial16_peptide_formation.swf" height="480" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="640"&gt;&lt;param name="quality" value="high" /&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="https://online.science.psu.edu/sites/default/files/biol110/tutorial16_peptide_formation.swf" /&gt;&lt;embed height="480" hspace="10" pluginspage="http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer" quality="high" src="assets/tutorial16_peptide_formation.swf" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" vspace="10" width="640"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Nucleic Acids&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 13. DNA nucleotide components." src="assets/tutorial16_DNA_nucleotides.jpg" style="height: 524px; width: 600px;" title="Figure 13. DNA nucleotide components." /&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 12. The structure of nucleic acids.  DNA and RNA consist of a sugar, a phosphate group, and a nitrogenous base." src="assets/tutorial16_nucleic_acid.jpg" style="height: 477px; width: 600px;" title="Figure 12. The structure of nucleic acids.  DNA and RNA consist of a sugar, a phosphate group, and a nitrogenous base." /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nucleic acids are &lt;strong&gt;deoxyribonucleic acid&lt;/strong&gt; (DNA) and &lt;strong&gt;ribonucleic acid&lt;/strong&gt;(RNA). DNA and RNA work together to affect the synthesis of proteins. Nucleic acid molecules are polymers of nucleotides, which are simple structures that consist of a sugar, a phosphate, and a nitrogenous base. &lt;strong&gt;Nitrogenous bases&lt;/strong&gt; are ringed structures consisting of nitrogen, carbon, and hydrogen (depicted at right).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;Specifically, RNA nucleotides have ribose as their sugar and any one of the following nitrogenous bases: adenine, guanine, cytosine, and uracil. DNA nucleotides have deoxyribose as their sugar and any one of the following nitrogenous bases: adenine, guanine, cytosine, and thymine (shown at left).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 14.  The structure of a DNA molecule." src="assets/tutorial16_DNA_structure.jpg" style="height: 667px; width: 600px;" title="Figure 14.  The structure of a DNA molecule." /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This figure illustrates how nucleotide monomers are joined to make a nucleic acid polymer; in this case a DNA double helix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DNA usually exists as paired strands, with the two sides held together by hydrogen bonds between the nitrogenous bases (shown in more detail at right). Specifically, cytosine will bind to guanine, and thymine to adenine. However, RNA is a single-stranded molecule.The roles of DNA and RNA will be discussed in future tutorials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tutorial focused on basic biochemistry. Many of life&amp;#39;s chemical processes involve the synthesis of larger molecules from smaller building blocks, in an event that is generally termed anabolism. These larger molecules can then be broken down in a process that is termed catabolism. Later in the course we will examine some specific anabolic events and how they contribute to the life of a growing organism. We will also examine how catabolic events can be used to transduce energy that is necessary to sustain life. To understand these biochemical events, it is important to know some basic chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our bodies are comprised of over 70% water. All life on the planet depends on this molecule, and you should be aware of the polar character of this molecule and how polarity affects the ability of one water molecule to interact with another water molecule, as well as with other polar molecules. Water is an excellent solvent and is capable of dissolving a variety of polar molecules. A molecule that can readily interact with water is a hydrophilic molecule, and one that does not interact with water is a hydrophobic molecule. Not all molecules have a strictly hydrophilic/hydrophobic character; some have both and are termed amphipathic (or amphiphilic).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carbon is a very important element for life. Due to its chemical versatility, it is found in thousands of compounds within living organisms. To understand biochemistry, you need to have a fundamental understanding of the major classes of molecules that are composed of carbon. Additionally, it is important to understand the relationship between these carbon-containing molecules and water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lipids are a class of carbon-containing molecules that have a hydrophobic character. They either totally lack any polar characteristics or their polar character is limited to a small area of the molecule. Be sure that you understand how the polar character of a molecule influences its ability to interact with water. Fats are lipids that are solid at room temperature and that do not readily interact with water. On the other hand, oils are lipids that are liquid at room and that do not readily interact with water. Phospholipids are a class of lipids that have amphipathic properties, and they are a major component of cellular membranes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carbohydrates are another class of carbon-bearing molecules, and they are used by the cell for energy storage and as structural molecules. Later in the course you will learn how energy is extracted from monosaccharides in the processes of glycolysis and cellular respiration. Carbohydrates are also found as polysaccharides, which are involved in energy storage and in building various cellular components.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proteins are composed of amino acids (there are twenty naturally occurring amino acids), and these subunits are linked together (via peptide bonds) to form polypeptide chains. A protein may be comprised of a single polypeptide chain (which is encoded by a single gene), or it may be comprised of two or more polypeptides (each polypeptide chain may be encoded for by a separate gene). Proteins play a variety of roles within the living organism. They can catalyze various chemical reactions (catabolic and anabolic), and they can form structural elements. Additionally, some proteins can convert chemical energy into mechanical energy; such proteins are involved in various motor activities within organisms.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

&lt;h2&gt;Introduction and Goals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last tutorial concluded with a discussion of nucleic acid structure. Watson and Crick concluded their 1953 paper on the structure of DNA with the following statement:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial17_cartoon.jpg" title="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;It has not escaped our notice that the specific pairing we have postulated immediately suggests a possible copying mechanism for the genetic material.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 1.  The structure of DNA.  Notice the base pairing rules - A always pairs with T and G always pairs with C." src="assets/Tutorial17_DNA_structure1.jpg" style="width: 450px; height: 500px;" title="Figure 1.  The structure of DNA.  Notice the base pairing rules - A always pairs with T and G always pairs with C." /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &quot;specific pairing&quot; they mentioned is the hydrogen-bond association between adenine and thymine, and guanine and cytosine. The &quot;copying mechanism&quot; is DNA replication, an amazingly simple yet surprisingly accurate series of steps by which DNA carries the instructions for its own reproduction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tutorial will cover DNA replication first, then the synthesis of RNA, and conclude with protein synthesis. By the end of the tutorial you should have a basic understanding of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;DNA replication&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;RNA transcription&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Protein translation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;object align="bottom" classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0" data="https://online.science.psu.edu/sites/default/files/biol110/Tutorial17_DNA_replication1.swf" height="480" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="640"&gt;&lt;param name="quality" value="high" /&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="https://online.science.psu.edu/sites/default/files/biol110/Tutorial17_DNA_replication1.swf" /&gt;&lt;embed height="480" hspace="10" pluginspage="http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer" quality="high" src="assets/Tutorial17_DNA_replication1.swf" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" vspace="10" width="640"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;DNA Replication&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DNA replication can be divided into several basic components. The double helix unwinds and nitrogenous bases are added to each strand of the existing molecule (but only onto one end of each), resulting in two perfect copies from one original.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 2.  Semiconservative DNA Replication.  Each new molecule of DNA is comprised of one parental strand and one newly synthesized strand." src="assets/Tutorial17_semiconservative_replication.jpg" style="height: 243px; width: 400px;" title="Figure 2.  Semiconservative DNA Replication.  Each new molecule of DNA is comprised of one parental strand and one newly synthesized strand." /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This type of replication is termed semiconservative replication because each newly formed molecule of DNA has one strand conserved from the parent molecule and one newly synthesized strand (depicted left).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 3.  DNA structure." src="assets/Tutorial17_DNA_structure_0.jpg" title="Figure 3.  DNA structure." /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The animation on the left gives an overview of DNA replication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a given piece of DNA, replication begins at numerous &lt;strong&gt;origins of replication&lt;/strong&gt;. Each origin of replication is composed of a team of enzyme proteins that are involved in DNA replication. &lt;strong&gt;Helicases&lt;/strong&gt; unwind the DNA helix, &lt;strong&gt;single-strand binding proteins&lt;/strong&gt; keep the strands separate while &lt;strong&gt;primases&lt;/strong&gt; initiate replication, and &lt;strong&gt;DNA polymerase&lt;/strong&gt; adds nucleotides to the unwound parent molecule. While the fundamentals of replication are simple, there is a feature of DNA structure that makes things a bit more complicated; the strands have opposite chemical polarities. This can be hard to comprehend because the strands seem identical. However, a close inspection reveals that the H-bonding that occurs between bases is only achieved if the strands have opposite polarities. This arrangement of strands is &lt;strong&gt;antiparallel&lt;/strong&gt;, with one strand designated the 3&amp;#39;-to-5&amp;#39; strand and the other the 5&amp;#39;-to-3&amp;#39; strand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="0" src="http://c.gigcount.com/wildfire/IMP/CXNID=2000002.0NXC/bT*xJmx*PTEzMDg2Njk1ODU*ODEmcHQ9MTMwODY2OTU4ODMxNSZwPTIwNjQyMSZkPWIyMTIyMjkxJmc9MiZvPTk2NjhhNGRlZDA4/NDRmNzlhYTY1ZTI4N2RlOTA2Y2E4Jm9mPTA=.gif" style="visibility: hidden; width: 0px; height: 0px;" width="0" /&gt;&lt;object align="bottom" data="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2122291" height="480" hspace="10" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" vspace="10" width="640"&gt;&lt;param name="quality" value="high" /&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2122291" /&gt;&lt;param name="wmode" value="transparent" /&gt;&lt;param name="src" value="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2122291" /&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DNA polymerase can only add nucleotides to the 3&amp;#39; end of a parent strand. Therefore, nucleotide addition is a smooth, continuous process along one of the strands (the &lt;strong&gt;leading strand&lt;/strong&gt;) of DNA. The other strand (the &lt;strong&gt;lagging strand&lt;/strong&gt;) has a discontinuous mode of replication because DNA polymerase can only work by starting from the &lt;strong&gt;replication fork&lt;/strong&gt;(where DNA is unwinding) and progressing outward (until it runs into a previously synthesized fragment). An added wrinkle to the process on the lagging strand is created by the lack of a continuous new strand; DNA polymerase can only add nucleotides to an existing 3&amp;#39; nucleotide. How is this lagging strand started? Primase has the ability to synthesize a short &lt;strong&gt;primer&lt;/strong&gt; made of a few nucleotides of RNA. DNA polymerase can then add DNA nucleotides to the end of this primer sequence and synthesize relatively short stretches of DNA known as &lt;strong&gt;Okazaki fragments&lt;/strong&gt;. An additional enzyme (&lt;strong&gt;ligase&lt;/strong&gt;) seals the fragments into a continuous strand of DNA. The figure above provides an overview of the enzymes involved, antiparallelism, and the overall direction of DNA replication. All of this takes place in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells (cells that have membrane-bound nuclei and organelles). Be sure that you study this figure carefully. You could see this figure unlabeled and be asked to name the enzymes and their functions on an exam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 4.  An overview of DNA replication." src="assets/Tutorial17_DNA_replication_overview.jpg" title="Figure 4.  An overview of DNA replication." /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In spite of the rules of base-pairing, sometimes mistakes are made in the synthesis of new DNA molecules. This occurs about once in every 10,000 base pairs. This fraction may seem small, but left unchecked could be disastrous. However, various repair mechanisms fix these errors and, in the end, the actual observed error rate is very low (often less than one mistake/10 million bases). Numerous specialized proteins are known to repair base-pairing errors and damage to existing molecules of DNA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 style="text-align: ;"&gt;&lt;object align="bottom" data="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2122300" height="480" hspace="10" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" vspace="10" width="640"&gt;&lt;param name="quality" value="high" /&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2122300" /&gt;&lt;param name="wmode" value="transparent" /&gt;&lt;param name="src" value="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2122300" /&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Gene To Protein: The Central Dogma&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The central dogma (prevailing theme) of molecular biology is: DNA is transcribed into messenger RNA, and messenger RNA is translated into proteins. In other words, DNA codes for the synthesis of polypeptides, which in a specific conformation and perhaps in conjunction with other polypeptides make up proteins. This is accomplished via two processes: &lt;strong&gt;transcription&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;translation&lt;/strong&gt;. First, one of the DNA strands is used as a template to make messenger RNA (mRNA; discussed herein). This single strand of bases is then complementary to one side of the DNA molecule and is identical (except for the substitution of uracil for thymine) to the other strand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 5. Transcription and Translation in Prokaryotic Cells versus Eukaryotic Cells." src="assets/Tutorial17_transcription_translation.jpg" title="Figure 5. Transcription and Translation in Prokaryotic Cells versus Eukaryotic Cells." /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transcription occurs in the nucleus of eukaryotes, but then the mRNA leaves the nucleus to begin translating proteins. The image above outlines these steps, along with where they occur in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. Note that because prokaryotes do not have a nucleus and mRNA has nowhere to travel, proteins can be translated from mRNA immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;object data="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2122310" height="480" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="640"&gt;&lt;param name="quality" value="high" /&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2122310" /&gt;&lt;param name="wmode" value="transparent" /&gt;&lt;embed height="480" hspace="10" quality="high" src="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2122310" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" vspace="10" width="640" wmode="transparent"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Gene To Protein: The Triplet Code&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="0" src="http://c.gigcount.com/wildfire/IMP/CXNID=2000002.0NXC/bT*xJmx*PTEzMDg2Njk5Nzk1MjEmcHQ9MTMwODY2OTk4MjM3NyZwPTIwNjQyMSZkPWIyMTIyMzEwJmc9MiZvPTk2NjhhNGRlZDA4/NDRmNzlhYTY1ZTI4N2RlOTA2Y2E4Jm9mPTA=.gif" style="visibility: hidden; width: 0px; height: 0px;" width="0" /&gt;It should be clear that it is the actual sequence of nucleotides (adenines, guanines, cytosines, and thymines) in a DNA strand that determines the type of protein that is synthesized (depicted here). However, there are four possible bases and twenty possible amino acids that join to form a polypeptide chain, so one base cannot code for one amino acid; that scenario would yield only four possibilities. A two-base code would provide only sixteen possibilities, so apparently a minimum of three bases is needed to specify a particular amino acid. In 1961, Marshall Nirenberg &quot;cracked&quot; the &lt;strong&gt;genetic code&lt;/strong&gt; by determining the &lt;strong&gt;codon&lt;/strong&gt;(sequence of bases) that specifies the amino acid phenylalanine. The amino acids lysine, glycine and proline followed, and now the sequence of bases that codes for each of the amino acids found in proteins is known. The image below illustrates the &quot;dictionary&quot; of the genetic code for amino acids by RNA bases (complementary to the original DNA template strand). The way in which a sequence of DNA bases is transcribed into complementary RNA bases and then translated into corresponding amino acids is illustrated in the image above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 6.  The genetic code is a triplet code." src="assets/Tutorial17_triplet_code.jpg" title="Figure 6.  The genetic code is a triplet code." /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;Two adjectives that are often used to describe the genetic code are &quot;unambiguous&quot; and &quot;redundant.&quot; Unambiguous means that the codons are fixed and that each codon specifies one amino acid. For example, ACC codes for tryptophan and nothing else. However, codons may be redundant, meaning that several codons may say the same thing. For example, CAA, CAC, CAG, and CAT all code for a single amino acid (valine). This image illustrates how codons are unambiguous and redundant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Gene To Protein: Transcription&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How are proteins made? First, one of the two strands of DNA is transcribed into a single strand of complementary RNA termed &lt;strong&gt;messenger RNA&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;strong&gt;mRNA&lt;/strong&gt;). As you should now understand, this RNA is complementary to only one of the DNA strands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 7.  The Genetic Code." src="assets/Tutorial17_genetic_code.jpg" title="Figure 7.  The Genetic Code." /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned, the process of transcription occurs in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells and requires that the two strands of DNA separate, or open up sufficiently enough so that complementary RNA nucleotides can be added to one side of the DNA molecule. The strand that is copied is the &lt;strong&gt;template strand&lt;/strong&gt;. The enzyme &lt;strong&gt;RNA polymerase&lt;/strong&gt;separates the DNA strands and joins the RNA nucleotides along the exposed DNA template. This process is initiated when certain proteins, &lt;strong&gt;transcription factors&lt;/strong&gt;, bind to a specific starting point, the &lt;strong&gt;promoter&lt;/strong&gt;. The promoter is actually a sequence of DNA bases that signals the beginning of RNA synthesis. RNA polymerase then adds nucleotides to the 3&amp;#39; end of the elongating RNA molecule. The enzyme then moves down the DNA strand, unwinding as it goes and allowing the DNA helix to reform after a sequence has been transcribed. This continues until a specific RNA sequence is transcribed. This sequence, the &lt;strong&gt;terminator sequence&lt;/strong&gt;, signals the end of RNA synthesis. Transcription is broken down into three stages: initiation, elongation, and termination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This animation shows the process of transcription.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0" data="https://online.science.psu.edu/sites/default/files/biol110/Tutorial17_transcription.swf" height="480" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="640"&gt;&lt;param name="quality" value="high" /&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="https://online.science.psu.edu/sites/default/files/biol110/Tutorial17_transcription.swf" /&gt;&lt;embed height="480" hspace="10" pluginspage="http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer" quality="high" src="assets/Tutorial17_transcription.swf" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" vspace="10" width="640"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Gene To Protein: Translation Ingredients&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to mRNA, two other types of RNA are needed for protein synthesis. These are &lt;strong&gt;ribosomal RNA&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;strong&gt;rRNA&lt;/strong&gt;) and &lt;strong&gt;transfer RNA&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;strong&gt;tRNA&lt;/strong&gt;). Ribosomal RNA combines with proteins to form &lt;strong&gt;ribosomes&lt;/strong&gt;. Ribosomes are cellular structures where polypeptides form. Ribosomes actually consist of two subunits: one large and one small.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 8. Overview of Involvement of Ribosomes, tRNA and mRNA in Translation." src="assets/Tutorial17_translation.jpg" title="Figure 8. Overview of Involvement of Ribosomes, tRNA and mRNA in Translation." /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As illustrated in this figure, tRNA molecules transport amino acids to the growing polypeptide chain. Each tRNA molecule has an amino acid attachment site for a particular amino acid and an &lt;strong&gt;anticodon&lt;/strong&gt; (a sequence of three nucleotides that is complementary to a sequence of bases in the mRNA strand).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 9. The Structure of Transfer RNA (tRNA)." src="assets/Tutorial17_tRNA.jpg" title="Figure 9. The Structure of Transfer RNA (tRNA)." /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An additional component, the enzyme aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase, insures that a given tRNA molecule picks up only its particular amino acid. Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase has specific sites that bind amino acids and tRNA, and energy is required to bring these raw materials together. &lt;img alt="Figure 10. Aminoacyl-tRNA Synthetase's Role in Translation." src="/courses/biol110/sites/edu.courses.biol110/files/images/Tutorial17_aminoacyl_tRNA.jpg" title="Figure 10. Aminoacyl-tRNA Synthetase's Role in Translation." /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(This explains the yellow ATP in this figure; to be discussed in future tutorials.) Also, be aware that each codon has its own tRNA, with its own anticodon. To insure high fidelity of protein translation, each tRNA has a corresponding aminoacyl-tRNA. Once you&amp;#39;re comfortable with all the necessary components (mRNA, ribosomes, tRNA, amino acids), proceed to protein synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 11. Overview of Involvement of Ribosomes, tRNA and mRNA in Translation." src="assets/Tutorial17_aminoacyl_tRNA.jpg" title="Figure 11. Overview of Involvement of Ribosomes, tRNA and mRNA in Translation." /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;Polypeptide construction does not occur in the nucleus. The ribosomes, aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases and amino acids are located outside of the nucleus. Therefore, mRNA, rRNA and tRNA must all travel out of the nucleus before translation can begin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 12.  Initiation of Translation." src="assets/Tutorial17_translation2.jpg" title="Figure 12.  Initiation of Translation." /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic concept of translation is depicted in the left image. See how mRNA, ribosomes, tRNA and amino acids all interact to make a polypeptide chain. Just like transcription, this takes place in three stages: initiation, elongation, and termination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;Initiation: In initiation, mRNA binds to the small subunit of a ribosome. An initiation codon, AUG, binds with an initiator tRNA molecule that bears the anticodon UAC and the amino acid methionine. Then a large subunit of a ribosome attaches, making the initiation complex complete and allowing translation to begin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;img alt="Figure 13. The Three Attachment Sites On a Ribosome." src="assets/Tutorial17_translation3.jpg" title="Figure 13. The Three Attachment Sites On a Ribosome." /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This figure illustrates that there are actually three attachment sites on a ribosome. They are the exit site, the peptidyl-tRNA binding site, and the aminoacyl-tRNA binding site (also called the E, P, and A sites).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 14. Peptide Chain Elongation During Translation." src="assets/Tutorial17_translation4.jpg" title="Figure 14. Peptide Chain Elongation During Translation." /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;Elongation: In the elongation stage, the peptide grows by addition of amino acids according to the sequence of bases in the mRNA molecule. This is accomplished through codon recognition, peptide bond formation, and translocation. Basically, a tRNA carrying the appropriate amino acid binds to the A-site, and a peptide bond forms between the new amino acid and the end of the growing polypeptide. Then everything shifts: the P-site tRNA is bumped to the E-site, where it dissociates from the ribosome; the A-site tRNA moves into the P-site; and a new aminoacyl-tRNA attaches to the now open A-site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Termination: Elongation continues until a mRNA &lt;strong&gt;stop codon&lt;/strong&gt;reaches the A-site of the ribosome. Stop codons include UAA, UAG and UGA, and they do not code for any amino acids. They signal the end of translation. Instead of a tRNA, a &lt;strong&gt;release factor protein&lt;/strong&gt; binds to the stop codon and the newly synthesized polypeptide is liberated from the ribosome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This new polypeptide will undergo coiling and folding to form its secondary and tertiary structures, and it might combine with additional polypeptide chains for its quaternary structure (go back and review protein structure, if necessary), hence finally making a protein.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Gene To Protein: Gene Regulation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recall that we discussed promoter regions of DNA and how these promoters bind specific proteins to initiate transcription, thereby setting the stage for protein synthesis. Different genes may have different promoters that respond to different transcription factor proteins. &lt;strong&gt;Gene regulation&lt;/strong&gt; describes how genes can be &quot;turned on&quot; to synthesize a needed protein, or &quot;turned off&quot; to stop synthesis of a protein that is no longer needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tutorial examined DNA replication, RNA transcription, and protein translation. These processes are pivotal to life, so it will be important that you have a firm grasp on the basic aspects of these processes (i.e., to the level presented in this tutorial).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All cells that divide need to replicate their DNA so that each daughter cell contains a full complement of all the parent&amp;#39;s genetic information. In the process of replication, the two strands are replicated with remarkable fidelity. To appreciate this process, keep a couple of things in mind. First, DNA is comprised of two antiparallel strands. The polarity of each strand is due to the manner in which the nucleotides are linked together. Second, DNA is synthesized in only one direction; 5&amp;#39; to 3&amp;#39;. Be sure that you understand that one strand is synthesized continuously, and that the other is synthesized discontinuously. Be sure that you understand why this is so, and be sure that you are familiar with the basic steps involved in this process.&lt;img border="0" height="0" src="http://c.gigcount.com/wildfire/IMP/CXNID=2000002.0NXC/bT*xJmx*PTEzMDg2NzY4NTYzNjEmcHQ9MTMwODY3Njg1ODM3OCZwPTIwNjQyMSZkPWIyMTIyOTc4Jmc9MiZvPTk2NjhhNGRlZDA4/NDRmNzlhYTY1ZTI4N2RlOTA2Y2E4Jm9mPTA=.gif" style="visibility: hidden; width: 0px; height: 0px;" width="0" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process of RNA transcription has some similarities to DNA replication (e.g., synthesis occurs in the 5&amp;#39; to 3&amp;#39; direction), but it also has some important differences. First, only one strand of DNA is used as a template for RNA synthesis. Second, ribonucleotides are used instead of deoxyribonucleotides. Not all DNA in a genome is transcribed at once. Rather, via the action of transcription factors, only selected genes are transcribed at a given time. Be sure that you understand the basic aspects of this process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protein translation is the process by which messenger RNA (mRNA) supplies the necessary information for the linear synthesis of proteins. There are three basic components to a cell&amp;#39;s translational machinery: mRNA, tRNA, and ribosomes. Messenger RNA provides the template that will be used for ordering the correct sequence of amino acids. Fidelity of the translational process is assured, in part, by the fact that each amino acid has its own transfer RNA. Transfer RNA (tRNA) is found with an appropriate amino acid. For example, a tRNA that has an anticodon of &quot;UAC&quot; will bind to the triplet on the mRNA with the complimentary sequence &quot;AUG.&quot; Thus, each tRNA delivers the appropriate amino acid to the ribosome; ordering of amino acids is determined by the linear arrangement of the genetic code. Be sure that you understand the relationship between these three components of the cell&amp;#39;s translational machinery.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

&lt;h2&gt;Introduction and Goals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bacteria are everywhere. They have been found at the deepest depths of the oceans and high above in the atmosphere. Based on sheer numbers and species diversity, they are the most successful group of life on the planet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tutorial is the first in a three-part series discussing prokaryotes. By the end of this first tutorial you should have a basic understanding of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The basic features of all prokaryotes&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The diverse lifestyles of prokaryotes&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Why prokaryotes can undergo rapid evolutionary change&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The different nutritional modes of prokaryotes&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The basic genetic organization of prokaryotes&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Asexual reproduction as a means for acquiring new genetic information&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Basic Features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A defining feature of &lt;strong&gt;prokaryotes&lt;/strong&gt; is their lack of membrane-bound nuclei. This is not to say they lack subcellular specialization because some prokaryotes have very elaborate internal membranes. However, they generally have less subcellular specialization than &lt;strong&gt;eukaryotes&lt;/strong&gt; (organisms with membrane-bound nuclei and organelles). Also, prokaryotes are usually much smaller than eukaryotic cells (1-5 microns compared to 10-100 microns). They are often described as single-celled organisms, but they can form colonies that show a remarkable level of complexity (as depicted in this colorized image of a bacterial colony). The shape of individual cells is used to classify prokaryotes; they can be either spherical (&lt;strong&gt;coccus&lt;/strong&gt;), rod-shaped (&lt;strong&gt;bacillus&lt;/strong&gt;), or helical (&lt;strong&gt;spirillum&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This animation is a simple game to test your understanding of the basic features of a prokaryote.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0" data="https://online.science.psu.edu/sites/default/files/biol110/tutorial18_matching_prokaryote.swf" height="480" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="640"&gt;&lt;param name="quality" value="high" /&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="https://online.science.psu.edu/sites/default/files/biol110/tutorial18_matching_prokaryote.swf" /&gt;&lt;embed height="480" hspace="10" pluginspage="http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer" quality="high" src="assets/tutorial18_matching_prokaryote.swf" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" vspace="10" width="640"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Classification&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last few decades, several taxonomic schemes have been used to describe life. One of the simplest divided life into prokaryotes and eukaryotes; that is, those organisms without nuclei went into one group and those with nuclei went into another, respectively. Another commonly used scheme divided life into five kingdoms: Monera (prokaryotes), Protista, Plantae, Fungi, and Animalia. Keep in mind that classification schemes strive to show the evolutionary relationships between groups, and in recent years it has become apparent that the evolutionary relationships of prokaryotes are quite complex. One prokaryotic group, the Archaea, have some features that are more eukaryotic than prokaryotic. Although the Archaea lack a nucleus, their genetic organization is more like that of a eukaryote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 2.  The Three-Domain System of Classification." src="assets/tutorial18_fig2_3_domain_system.jpg" title="Figure 2.  The Three-Domain System of Classification." /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To reconcile new data, the taxonomic scheme of life has been revised. The most current scheme proposes that life be divided into three domains. In this scheme prokaryotic organisms can belong to the domain &lt;strong&gt;Archaea&lt;/strong&gt; or the domain &lt;strong&gt;Bacteria&lt;/strong&gt;, while those organisms that have a nucleus comprise the third domain, &lt;strong&gt;Eukarya&lt;/strong&gt;. Organisms that make up these three domains are sometimes referred to as archaebacteria, eubacteria and eukaryotes, respectively. This figure illustrates the relationship between the three domains. Keep in mind that the common ancestor of the prokaryotes most likely arose about 3 billion years ago.Archaea are sometimes referred to as &lt;strong&gt;extremophiles&lt;/strong&gt;, inhabiting extreme environments (e.g., hot springs, salt ponds, Arctic ice, deep oil wells, acidic ponds that form near mines, and hydrothermal vents); however, these environments are not extreme to the archaea. In fact, many extremophiles die when moved to our environment. Life is relative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 3.  Thermophilic (heat-loving) bacteria." src="assets/tutorial18_fig3_thermophilic_bacteria.jpg" title="Figure 3.  Thermophilic (heat-loving) bacteria.  Limestone terraces, formed by precipitation from calcium-rich water flowing from a raised hotpool. Pink, green, and brown-colored archaebacteria occupy the thermal gradients in the flowing water (60-100°C)." /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest of the prokaryotes are classified as bacteria. Some textbooks and articles still refer to all prokaryotes as bacteria, but there is an increasing tendency to make a distinction between archaebacteria and bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Prokaryotes by the Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of metabolic impact and numbers, prokaryotes dominate the biosphere. They outnumber all eukaryotes combined. They live in a myriad of environments and even a teaspoon of common dirt can harbor 100 million or more bacteria. Not only are bacteria plentiful in total numbers, but the species diversity may be quite high as well. Although recognizing distinct species of bacteria is a challenge for microbiologists modern approaches using DNA diversity analysis, suggest that bacteria spawn new species quite rapidly. Recent studies suggest that in that same teaspoon of soil there could reside up to 1 million different species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fast Growth and High Rates of Evolution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some cases, prokaryotes can divide in as little as 20 minutes (although much slower rates are also observed). Generally, prokaryotes have three factors that enable them to grow rapidly. First, prokaryotes have a small genome (genetic material). Second, prokaryotes have simple morphologies (structural features). Third, prokaryotes replicate via &lt;strong&gt;binary fission&lt;/strong&gt;(cell division in which a prokaryotic chromosome replicates and the mother cell pinches in half to form two new daughter cells). These three factors allow for a short generation time. This short generation time means that evolutionary changes occur relatively quickly when compared to longer-lived species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Genetic Organization Aids Fast Generation Times&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared to eukaryotes, prokaryotes usually have much smaller genomes. On average, a eukaryotic cell has 1000 times more DNA than a prokaryote. This means that less DNA must be replicated with each division in prokaryotes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DNA in prokaryotes is concentrated in the &lt;strong&gt;nucleoid&lt;/strong&gt;. The prokaryotic chromosome is a double-stranded DNA molecule arranged as a single large ring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prokaryotes often have smaller rings of extrachromosomal DNA termed &lt;strong&gt;plasmids&lt;/strong&gt;. Most plasmids consist of only a few genes. Plasmids are not required for survival in most environments because the prokaryotic chromosome programs all of the cell&amp;#39;s essential functions. However, plasmids may contain genes that provide resistance to antibiotics, metabolism of unusual nutrients, and other special functions. Plasmids replicate independently of the main chromosome, and many can be readily transferred between prokaryotic cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 4.  Binary division in a bacterium." src="assets/tutorial18_fig4_bacterial_division.jpg" title="Figure 4.  Binary division in a bacterium." /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prokaryotes replicate via binary fission. Binary fission is simply cell division whereby two identical offspring each receive a copy of the original, single, parental chromosome. Binary fission is a type of asexual reproduction (reproduction that does not require the union of two reproductive cells, and that produces offspring genetically identical to the parent cell). A population of rapidly growing prokaryotes can synthesize their DNA almost continuously, which aids in their fast generation times. Even as a cell is physically separating, its DNA can be replicating for the next round of cell division.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0" data="https://online.science.psu.edu/sites/default/files/biol110/tutorial18_bacterial_cell_division.swf" height="480" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="640"&gt;&lt;param name="quality" value="high" /&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="https://online.science.psu.edu/sites/default/files/biol110/tutorial18_bacterial_cell_division.swf" /&gt;&lt;embed height="480" hspace="10" pluginspage="http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer" quality="high" src="assets/tutorial18_bacterial_cell_division.swf" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" vspace="10" width="640"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Asexual Reproduction and the Transfer of Genetic Information Between Prokaryotes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prokaryotes do not alternate between the haploid and diploid states, hence meiosis and fertilization are not components of their life cycles. Rather, binary fission is the main method of reproduction in prokaryotes. This form of asexual reproduction means that the genetic variation afforded by meiosis/fertilization does not occur in prokaryotes. Nonetheless, genetic variation does occur in prokaryotes, and mutations (coupled with short generation times) are one source of variation in the population. Remember that genetic variation, within a population, can be beneficial because it provides the raw materials for a population to adapt to a changing environment. Greater diversity in the gene pool increases the likelihood that at least some of the organisms in a population will have the right alleles to survive if environmental conditions change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Transformation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One way that genetic material can be moved between bacteria is &lt;strong&gt;transformation&lt;/strong&gt;. Transformation occurs when prokaryotes acquire genes from their surrounding environment. This DNA might have been left behind by other bacteria (from the same or different species) when they died. The foreign DNA is directly taken up by the cell and expressed. If the DNA contains a beneficial gene (e.g., one encoding for antibiotic resistance), then the individuals harboring that gene will have a selective advantage over their non-transformed counterparts. As long as individuals with this gene reproduce more successfully, compared to those lacking the gene, they will be more fit and the gene will increase in frequency (i.e., microevolution, via natural selection, will occur).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other examples include transformation of nonpathogenic bacteria into &lt;strong&gt;pathogenic&lt;/strong&gt; (harmful) strains. When harmless &lt;em&gt;Streptococcus pneumoniae&lt;/em&gt; bacteria are placed in a medium containing dead cells of the pathogenic strain, they can take up the DNA from the dead pathogenic cells. If the formerly harmless bacteria pick up the gene for pathogenicity, they will become pathogenic themselves. It is important to point out that pathogenicity may not confer a long-term increase in fitness; if the host dies, the microsymbiont is left in a cold house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transformation is commonly used by genetic engineers to relocate bacterial genes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conjugation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genetic material can also be moved between bacteria by &lt;strong&gt;conjugation&lt;/strong&gt;. The mechanism of conjugation requires that two living prokaryotic cells physically join with one another. Typically DNA transfer only goes one way, with the &quot;male&quot; using an appendage called a &lt;strong&gt;pilus&lt;/strong&gt; (plural, pili). In order to produce pili, prokaryotes must have a plasmid termed the &lt;strong&gt;F factor&lt;/strong&gt;(fertility factor plasmid). When a cell has the F factor plasmid, it is said to be F+. This F+ condition is heritable. If an F+ cell divides, both of the resulting cells will be F+. This condition is also &quot;contagious.&quot; After an F+ cell conjugates with a &quot;female&quot; cell that does not contain the F factor, the &quot;female&quot; cell obtains the F factor plasmid and becomes F+ (&quot;male&quot;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Click on the following to view a simple animation of an &lt;a href="http://www.sp.uconn.edu/%7Eterry/images/anim/Fmating.gif" rel="_blank"&gt;F-plasmid transfer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Transduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 5. Overview of Transduction." src="assets/tutorial18_fig5_transduction.jpg" title="Figure 5. Overview of Transduction." /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genetic material can also be moved between bacteria by &lt;strong&gt;transduction&lt;/strong&gt;. In this event, the exchange of DNA between prokaryotes is made possible by &lt;strong&gt;phages&lt;/strong&gt;(viruses that infect bacteria). Phages reproduce by injecting their genetic material inside the bacterial cell, then multiplying, and eventually bursting from the cell. In a mechanism referred to as &lt;strong&gt;specialized transduction&lt;/strong&gt;, the phage DNA inserts somewhat benignly into the bacterial host chromosome. Here it can lay dormant for many generations. However, under certain conditions, the phage DNA excises itself from the bacterial chromosome (usually carrying pieces of the chromosome with it), then replicates and forms new phages that burst out of the cell. These phages can reinfect other bacteria and thereby transfer not only their own DNA, but pieces of the former host DNA into the newly infected bacterium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Genetic Variation and Evolution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The short generation time associated with binary fission was pointed out earlier in this tutorial. We also know that mutations add new and different alleles to populations. These two factors (short generation times and mutations), combined with the processes of conjugation and transduction, help prokaryotic populations achieve vast genetic variation (without the alternation of haploid/diploid states seen in many eukaryotes). Generation times are minutes to hours, and can result in a beneficial mutation being heavily favored and passed on to a great number of offspring in a very short period of time. Once again, a short generation span enables prokaryotic populations to adapt very rapidly to environmental change. This adaptive evolution is as important now to prokaryotes as it was when prokaryotic life began to diversify a few billion years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Nutritional Modes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the course of evolution, prokaryotes have adapted to a myriad of environments. Part of this adaptation involves different ways of obtaining energy and carbon. In looking at the diversity of prokaryotes, one observes many different nutritional modes. When considering nutritional modes, there are some general features that are commonly used to categorize the nutritional state of any life form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="0" src="http://c.gigcount.com/wildfire/IMP/CXNID=2000002.0NXC/bT*xJmx*PTEzMDg5Mjc3NDcwMDEmcHQ9MTMwODkyNzc*OTQ5OSZwPTIwNjQyMSZkPWIyMTI4MTExJmc9MiZvPTk2NjhhNGRlZDA4/NDRmNzlhYTY1ZTI4N2RlOTA2Y2E4Jm9mPTA=.gif" style="visibility: hidden; width: 0px; height: 0px;" width="0" /&gt;&lt;object align="" data="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2128111" height="480" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="640"&gt;&lt;param name="quality" value="high" /&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2128111" /&gt;&lt;param name="wmode" value="transparent" /&gt;&lt;embed height="480" hspace="10" quality="high" src="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2128111" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" vspace="10" width="640" wmode="transparent"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All life can be categorized nutritionally, according to how an organism obtains its energy and from where it gets its carbon. The prefixes &quot;&lt;strong&gt;chemo&lt;/strong&gt;&quot; and &quot;&lt;strong&gt;photo&lt;/strong&gt;&quot; are used to describe whether the energy comes from a high-energy molecule (e.g., glucose) or from light, respectively. &quot;&lt;strong&gt;Auto&lt;/strong&gt;&quot; and &quot;&lt;strong&gt;hetero&lt;/strong&gt;&quot; are used to describe whether carbon dioxide or a more complex form of carbon is used as a carbon source, respectively. The prefixes are then affixed to the suffix &quot;&lt;strong&gt;troph&lt;/strong&gt;,&quot; meaning nourishment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tutorial introduced you to the prokaryotes. They are a very diverse group of organisms that are commonly referred to as bacteria; however, they are really comprised of two different domains. One domain, the Archaea, usually grow in the most extreme environments. Their ability to occupy extreme habitats is mirrored by their flexibility in utilizing resources; some species are photosynthetic, whereas others can live on oil or hydrogen sulfide. The other domain, the Bacteria, is much more abundant. Although diverse, members of both domains share some common features. Prokaryotes lack membrane-bound nuclei, they are generally single-celled or colonial, and they are very small. The genetic organization of prokaryotes and binary fission as a means for replication aids in their fast generation times, which contributes to relatively quick evolutionary changes. We will continue our discussion of prokaryotes in the next tutorial by exploring their morphologies and by describing some of their interactions with other life forms.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

&lt;h2&gt;Introduction and Goals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 1.  Magnification of Vibrio cholerae" src="assets/tutorial19_Vibrio_cholerae.jpg" title="Figure 1.  Magnification of Vibrio cholerae" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a magnification of &lt;em&gt;Vibrio cholerae&lt;/em&gt;, the organism responsible for cholera. Note the tail-like flagellum on one end; many prokaryotes are propelled by rotating flagella. The cellular and genetic organization of prokaryotes was introduced in our last tutorial. Recall that we also introduced their morphologies by discussing three basic shape categories of prokaryotes: cocci, bacilli, and spirilla. We will continue our discussion by exploring their structure and movement, and by describing some interactions between prokaryotes and other life forms. By the end of this tutorial you should have a basic understanding of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Prokaryotic structure&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Relationships between prokaryotes and other life forms&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Diversity of carbon sources&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Beneficial bacteria&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Prokaryotic Cell Wall and Peptidoglycan&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cells of all organisms (including prokaryotes) are encased in a &lt;strong&gt;plasma membrane&lt;/strong&gt;, which consists of a phospholipid bilayer that is selectively permeable. This bilayer keeps salts and liquids in balance inside the cell by engulfing needed particles and ridding the cell of wastes. In addition to a plasma membrane, many organisms (including plants, fungi, and some protists) also have cell walls. These walls are involved in maintaining cell shape and protection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 2. Gram-positive versus gram-negative bacteria.  Gram's stain is used to differentiate bacteria, based on the amount of peptidoglycan in their cell walls." src="assets/tutorial19_bacterial_cell_walls.jpg" title="Figure 2. Gram-positive versus gram-negative bacteria.  Gram's stain is used to differentiate bacteria, based on the amount of peptidoglycan in their cell walls." /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most prokaryotes also have cell walls, but they are structurally different than those of the plants, fungi, and protists. For example, bacterial cell walls contain some amount of &lt;strong&gt;peptidoglycan&lt;/strong&gt;, which is a polymer consisting of sugar and polypeptides. If one were attempting to identify bacteria, one might first examine them under a microscope to detect whether the specimens were rod-shaped, round, or spiral. Then one might analyze the amount of peptidoglycan in the cell walls of the unknown organisms by using a technique known as &lt;strong&gt;Gram&amp;#39;s stain&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bacteria containing a lot of peptidoglycan in their cell walls also tend to have less complex cell walls, and are called &lt;strong&gt;gram-positive&lt;/strong&gt; bacteria. Conversely, &lt;strong&gt;gram-negative&lt;/strong&gt; bacteria have less peptidoglycan, but have more complex cell walls overall. The gram-negative bacteria have an additional outer membrane with attached &lt;strong&gt;lipopolysaccharides&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of these lipopolysaccharides are toxic, serving to counteract the natural defenses of host organisms. Also, the additional membrane of gram-negative bacteria can make them more resistant to antibacterial medications (&lt;strong&gt;antibiotics&lt;/strong&gt;). For these two reasons, a gram-negative bacterial infection can be far more severe than a gram-positive infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Capsule and Pilus&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Numerous adaptations by host organisms to fight bacterial infection, and counter adaptations by bacteria to evade these adaptive defenses, have resulted in bacteria that are skilled at survival in inhospitable conditions. In addition to cell walls and cell membranes, many bacteria have an additional layer outside the cell wall termed the &lt;strong&gt;capsule&lt;/strong&gt;. Capsules are sticky substances made and secreted by the bacteria, and they help the bacteria adhere to surfaces or to each other. Capsules also provide an additional layer of protection to the encapsulated organism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recall from the last tutorial that pili can provide an avenue for exchange of genetic information. Some prokaryotes also use these surface appendages for attachment to a variety of substrates. For example, &lt;em&gt;Neisseria gonorrhoeae&lt;/em&gt; attaches to the epithelium within the reproductive tract via pili, where they can inflict individuals with the STD that carries the species name. Mutant strains that lack pili are nonpathogenic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;How Do Prokaryotes Get Around?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 3.  Flagellum of a gram-negative bacterium." src="assets/tutorial19_bacterial_flagellum.jpg" title="Figure 3.  Flagellum of a gram-negative bacterium." /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many prokaryotes are capable of directional movement, and they can actually move quite quickly. Some motile prokaryotes can move 100 times their body length in one second. (Think about this in terms of human movement; if a running person has a six-foot stride, this translates to 600 feet/second!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some prokaryotes can secrete slimy chemicals and then glide around on them. Some helical bacteria, the spirochetes, have internal filaments that are arranged so that the whole organism rotates axially; because the organism is helical in shape, the resulting movement is analogous to the action of a corkscrew. The most common type of movement in prokaryotes is via flagellar action. A &lt;strong&gt;flagellum&lt;/strong&gt; (plural, flagella) is a long appendage specialized for locomotion, and while both eukaryotes and prokaryotes may exhibit flagellar motion, the flagella of prokaryotes are quite different from those of eukaryotes. Prokaryotic flagella consist of tightly wound chains of the protein flagellin attached to a molecular motor complex located within the cell wall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 4. Chemotaxis in bacteria." src="assets/tutorial19_chemotaxis.jpg" title="Figure 4. Chemotaxis in bacteria." /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bacterial flagella can rotate either clockwise or counterclockwise. When rotating clockwise, the flagella fly apart, causing the bacteria to tumble randomly. When rotating counterclockwise, the flagella are drawn together into a bundle that results in directional movement. Bacteria with flagella alternate between tumbling and directional movement. In some cases the movement is random, but in other cases there is a net oriented movement (&lt;strong&gt;taxis&lt;/strong&gt;) toward or away from a stimulus. Thus, the directed movement of these bacteria resembles the walk of a drunken sailor heading back to the ship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Social Life of Prokaryotes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From some of the previous examples, you might have concluded that bacteria are simply pathogens that cause diseases. However, this generalization would be wrong. In fact, the myriad of bacteria around us are either essential or benign to the life of other organisms(including ourselves). Humans are covered with bacteria (both inside and out). You may find this fact unsettling, but right now there are approximately 400 different species of bacteria living in your gastrointestinal system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="0" src="http://c.gigcount.com/wildfire/IMP/CXNID=2000002.0NXC/bT*xJmx*PTEzMDg5Mzk*MTc2MzcmcHQ9MTMwODkzOTQyMDQ4MSZwPTIwNjQyMSZkPWIyMTI4NDg3Jmc9MiZvPTk2NjhhNGRlZDA4/NDRmNzlhYTY1ZTI4N2RlOTA2Y2E4Jm9mPTA=.gif" style="visibility:hidden;width:0px;height:0px;" width="0" /&gt;&lt;object height="480" width="640"&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2128487" /&gt;&lt;param name="wmode" value="transparent" /&gt;&lt;embed height="480" src="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2128487" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="640" wmode="transparent"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only a relatively small percentage of the bacterial species that colonize on us (and all other multicellular organisms) are pathogenic. The vast majority of bacteria are ecologically significant and extremely beneficial. In most instances, bacteria colonize on and live harmoniously with other species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state of any two species having an extended and intimate association is termed &lt;strong&gt;symbiosis&lt;/strong&gt;. You might have heard other definitions for this term, but researchers in the field agree that this is the best definition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interacting organisms (&lt;strong&gt;symbionts&lt;/strong&gt;) have varying relationships with one another. The &lt;strong&gt;host&lt;/strong&gt; (the larger of two species) and the &lt;strong&gt;microsymbiont&lt;/strong&gt; (the smaller of the two species) may derive mutual benefit from the association, in which case the symbiosis is termed &lt;strong&gt;mutualism&lt;/strong&gt;. At the other end of the symbiotic spectrum is a relationship whereby one member of the symbiosis derives benefit at the expense of the other, which is termed &lt;strong&gt;parasitism&lt;/strong&gt;. In the middle of this spectrum are associations which appear benign (are neither of benefit nor harm) to either or both species; this form of symbiosis is termed &lt;strong&gt;commensalism&lt;/strong&gt;. These are not static relationships, and the association between the symbionts is not constant and can change, depending on conditions. For example, a relationship may be commensalistic (or even mutualistic) most of the time, but under certain conditions the association can turn parasitic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mutualistic Symbioses&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quite a few mutualistic symbioses are known, but unfortunately they don&amp;#39;t get nearly the attention they deserve. Without their existence, however, life as we know it would not exist. Let&amp;#39;s consider a few examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nitrogen is essential to all life. It is required for the synthesis of nucleic acids, proteins, and a host of other important biomolecules. However, without the action of certain prokaryotes, little nitrogen would be available to the biosphere. There are several species of bacteria that can convert atmospheric nitrogen&amp;nbsp; (N2) into a form (e.g., ammonium) that can be used by other life. One of the most important groups are those bacteria that form a symbiosis with certain plants. For example, &lt;em&gt;Rhizobium&lt;/em&gt; colonize on the roots of pea plants, where they fix nitrogen. The plant provides carbon to the bacteria, and the bacteria provide nitrogen to the plant; a classic and extremely important example of a mutualistic symbiosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the section on &lt;a href="https://online.science.psu.edu/biol110_sandbox_2381/node/8917"&gt;Prokaryotes III, Evolution and Early Metabolism&lt;/a&gt;, we will examine, in greater detail, the role that bacteria play in the cycling of nitrogen in the biosphere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mutualistic symbioses between prokaryotes and humans may also play a more general and important role. Go to the site that discusses the role of germ exposure during early infant development, and when you return be prepared to answer a question concerning a role that symbiotic bacteria may play in the development of specific cells involved in the human immune system.&amp;nbsp; Click here to read about &lt;a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2000/07/000719110937.htm" rel="_blank"&gt;Good Bugs.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Parasitism&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a parasitic symbiosis, one member of the symbiosis benefits at the expense of another. Parasitic bacteria that cause disease in their hosts are called pathogens. These pathogenic bacteria cause disease by either invading healthy host tissue or by producing toxins that poison the host. &lt;strong&gt;Exotoxins&lt;/strong&gt; are proteins secreted by prokaryotes, whereas &lt;strong&gt;endotoxins&lt;/strong&gt; are protein components of the outer cell membrane in some gram-negative bacteria. &lt;em&gt;Clostridium botulinum&lt;/em&gt; (the causative agent of botulism) is a notorious exotoxin-secreter, as is &lt;em&gt;Vibrio cholerae&lt;/em&gt;, which causes cholera. The causative agent of typhoid fever, &lt;em&gt;Salmonella typhi&lt;/em&gt;, produces endotoxins that counteract the human host&amp;#39;s natural defenses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Cholera and the Importance of Water Balance&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cholera is a disease caused by &lt;em&gt;Vibrio cholerae&lt;/em&gt;. This bacteria is spread via contaminated water supplies, and people who drink water tainted with this organism can succumb to the disease. The mortality rate of untreated, symptomatic individuals can be quite high; afflicted individuals can die within 24 hours. The bacteria itself does not cause the disease, rather it is the exotoxin it secretes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand how cholera kills, one needs to know about &lt;strong&gt;osmosis&lt;/strong&gt; (the net movement of water across a selectively permeable membrane, from lower solute concentrations to higher solute concentrations). So, what does osmosis have to do with cholera? Everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vibrio&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;cholera&lt;/em&gt; colonizes the intestines. The exotoxin (cholera toxin) stimulates the cells that line the lower GI tract (the intestinal epithelium) to secrete massive amounts of excessive ions into the lumen (the cavity) of the intestine. This creates an extremely hypertonic state within the intestinal lumen, relative to the epithelium. Think about the consequences of this in terms of osmosis and be prepared to make a prediction regarding the most severe symptoms of cholera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The Body As a Community&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember that our own bodies are teeming with bacteria, as are virtually all eukaryotes. At birth we were devoid of bacteria, but as we acquired bacteria through feeding, and simply by being around other humans, our bodies became colonized with hundreds of different species of bacteria. The relative proportions of these species are variable and some of our commensalistic bacteria can become parasitic when our natural defense mechanisms become depressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="0" src="http://c.gigcount.com/wildfire/IMP/CXNID=2000002.0NXC/bT*xJmx*PTEzMDg5Mzk2NjcyMTEmcHQ9MTMwODkzOTY2OTk*MiZwPTIwNjQyMSZkPWIyMTI4NDkxJmc9MiZvPTk2NjhhNGRlZDA4/NDRmNzlhYTY1ZTI4N2RlOTA2Y2E4Jm9mPTA=.gif" style="visibility:hidden;width:0px;height:0px;" width="0" /&gt;&lt;object height="480" width="640"&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2128491" /&gt;&lt;param name="wmode" value="transparent" /&gt;&lt;embed height="480" src="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2128491" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="640" wmode="transparent"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The relationship between host and symbiont can be quite complex. Termites are a good example of this complexity. We normally think of these insects as wood eaters, and indeed they can dine on our homes. However, they themselves cannot directly digest the wood. Inside the termite gut is a menagerie of protozoa (a protist; to be discussed in future tutorials) that ingest the wood particles consumed by the termite. But even these protozoa cannot directly digest the cellulose. Rather, living in and around the protozoa are bacteria that can degrade the wood. So it is the microsymbiont living within the microsymbiont of the termite host that actually degrades the wood. Life is interrelated in surprising ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Summary&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tutorial continued our discussion of prokaryotes by introducing their cell walls and various means of locomotion. Prokaryotes have a number of modifications to their walls. The gram-positive bacteria have walls rich in peptidoglycans (a class of molecule derived from sugars and proteins). Gram-negative bacteria have a double-walled character and do not have a great deal of peptidoglycans (which is why they do not stain well with Gram&amp;#39;s stain). On the other hand, the gram-negative bacteria are often rich in lipopolysaccharides (a class of molecules derived from lipids and sugars), which can be toxic to other life forms; many bacterial toxins belong to this class of molecules. An additional sticky capsule (and/or pili) may be present, which help some bacteria adhere to various substrates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to modifications to their walls, a variety of prokaryotes have the capability of moving about their environment. This movement is not random, but rather, can be governed by the presence of various molecules in the environment. Some bacteria can detect the presence of nutrients, and they move toward a high concentration of a particular carbon source in a process generally referred to as chemotaxis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 5.  Endospores are shown in the boxed portion of this Bacillus" src="assets/tutorial19_endospore.jpg" title="Figure 5.  Endospores are shown in the boxed portion of this Bacillus" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most prokaryotes are very sensitive to their environment and can alter their behavior in response to changing conditions. For example, most species of &lt;em&gt;Bacillus&lt;/em&gt; can form hardy spores in response to stressful conditions. These spores have low metabolic activity, can survive extreme conditions (e.g., boiling water) and are long-lived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A great deal of life on the planet depends on prokaryotes, either directly or indirectly. Nitrogen fixation is one example of how bacteria can be beneficial. Many prokaryotes form intimate associations with other species. These symbiotic relationships can take on a variety of forms. At one extreme are the mutualistic relationships. In a mutualistic symbiosis, both species derive benefit from the association; the bacteria that live in our lower digestive tract provide us with a number of vitamins and, in turn, we provide them with a source of carbon from the food we do not digest ourselves. At the other extreme is a parasitic symbiosis, in which the symbiont benefits at the expense of the host. Such parasitic bacteria are usually termed pathogenic because they can cause serious diseases. Microbiologists have provided us with an appreciation for prokaryotes, and their discoveries have led to new opportunities for using prokaryotes to better humanity and to combat diseases caused by pathogenic bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next tutorial will discuss the ecological significance of various types of prokaryotes (e.g., those used to clean up oil spills and fix nitrogen).&lt;/p&gt;</body>

&lt;h1&gt;Introduction and Goals&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;The last two tutorials discussed the diversity of prokaryotes and their various relationships with life in the biosphere. Much of this diversity is reflected in their diverse metabolic activities. More specifically, prokaryotes can use a variety of nitrogen and carbon sources, and in doing so they are important members of the biosphere. Humanity has exploited this evolved diversity by utilizing various bacteria for the cleansing of toxins in the environment, in a process known as &lt;strong&gt;bioremediation&lt;/strong&gt;. By the end of this tutorial you should be familiar with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The diversity of prokaryotic carbon sources&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Bioremediation&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Nitrogen use and the prokaryote&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Oxygen and metabolic relationships&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Origins of metabolic processes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Diversity of Carbon Sources&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prokaryotes can use carbon in a variety of forms, both as an energy source and as a precursor for anabolic reactions. As you&amp;#39;ve learned, carbon dioxide is the simplest form of carbon used. Organisms that use this simple form of carbon are often called &quot;carbon fixers.&quot; (You will learn more about this process in the photosynthesis tutorial.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most prokaryotes use sugars (monosaccharides and disaccharides) and complex carbohydrates (e.g., starch). However, very unusual forms of carbon can also be used by some prokaryotes. Some prokaryotes can feed on oil. Although a bane to the oil fields, these oil-eating bacteria have been used to help clean oil spills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some bacteria are capable of using exotic carbon compounds such as TNT and polychlorinated biphenols (PCBs). These bacteria render such compounds nontoxic. There is an emerging field of civil engineering that utilizes bacteria for the purpose of cleaning contaminated soils, wells, and river sediments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Prokaryotes and the Nitrogen Cycle&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 1. Overview of Nitrogen Fixation." src="assets/Tutorial20_nitrogen_cycle.jpg" title="Figure 1. Overview of Nitrogen Fixation." /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nitrogen is found in all proteins and nucleic acids, hence it is essential to all forms of life. This atom is abundant in the air around us in the form of atmospheric nitrogen. However, nitrogen availability is a problem because nitrogen, in its elemental form (N2 gas), is not usable by most organisms. Nitrogen can only be transformed into a biologically usable state (i.e., &quot;fixed&quot;) by certain nitrogen-fixing bacteria, in a process termed &lt;strong&gt;nitrogen fixation&lt;/strong&gt;. &quot;Nitrogen-fixers&quot; live in the aquatic environment, the soil, and in or around the roots and stems of certain species of plants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nitrogen gas (also known as dinitrogen or N2) is converted to ammonia (NH3) by nitrogen-fixing bacteria. The fixed nitrogen is then used by plants (and other soil- and aquatic-dwelling microorganisms) in various anabolic pathways leading to the synthesis of proteins, nucleic acids, and other nitrogenous molecules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plants, the primary energy producers in the terrestrial environment, are a major repository for fixed nitrogen in the terrestrial biosphere. When a plant is eaten, the herbivore obtains nitrogen in the form of proteins and nucleic acids (which are broken down during digestion and used by the herbivore for the production of its own nitrogen products). When a plant dies, a variety of &lt;strong&gt;saprobes&lt;/strong&gt; (those organisms that live on dead and decaying matter) also obtain nitrogen from the nitrogenous compounds previously made by the plant. Finally, fixed nitrogen can be reconverted by soil bacteria back into atmospheric nitrogen. The &lt;strong&gt;nitrogen cycle&lt;/strong&gt; is essential for all life on the planet. The previous tutorial briefly introduced the symbiosis that leads to nitrogen fixation. We will now examine this symbiosis in more detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The Nitrogen Fixers&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 2. Root Nodules of a Soybean Plant.  The nodules contain nitrogen-fixing bacteria." src="assets/Tutorial20_root_nodule.jpg" title="Figure 2. Root Nodules of a Soybean Plant.  The nodules contain nitrogen-fixing bacteria." /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost all &lt;strong&gt;legumes&lt;/strong&gt; (e.g., peas, alfalfa, and soybeans) are capable of housing nitrogen-fixing bacteria. The plant-prokaryote mutualism (the plant gets fixed nitrogen from the bacteria, while the bacteria get carbon from the plant) that results is determined by a complex series of events that begins with chemical communication between the participating organisms. Plants that participate in these symbioses secrete molecules (e.g., flavonoids) that act as chemical signals to a select species of bacteria. The term &lt;strong&gt;rhizobia&lt;/strong&gt; is applied to several species of bacteria that participate in these symbioses. The targeted rhizobia are induced to respond when the specific chemical signal stimulates specific genes to &quot;turn on.&quot; Bacteria then migrate toward the plant&amp;#39;s root. Once bacteria reach the root, a developmental change is induced in the root, which results in &lt;strong&gt;nodule&lt;/strong&gt; formation. The bacteria take up residence inside the nodule. Thus, the events of nodule formation involve chemical cross-signaling between the two participants. The environment of the plant-derived nodule is favorable for the fixation of nitrogen by the bacteria that live inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 3.  A Rhizobium. A bacterium capable of nitrogen-fixation." src="assets/Tutorial20_rhizobium.jpg" title="Figure 3.  A Rhizobium. A bacterium capable of nitrogen-fixation." /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;In addition to rhizobia/legume symbioses, several other symbiotic nitrogen-fixing symbioses are known. For example, various species of &lt;strong&gt;Cyanobacteria&lt;/strong&gt; (often referred to as blue-green algae) are capable of nitrogen fixation. One symbiosis is particularly important to humanity. Anabaena is a Cyanobacterium genus that colonizes on the leaves of an aquatic fern that grows in rice paddies; the symbiosis supplies nitrogen to the pond, where it subsequently is taken up and used by rice plants. About 75% of all rice is cultivated in flooded fields, and this symbiosis has allowed rice farmers to maintain high levels of productivity without the need for expensive chemical fertilizers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 4. A Cyanobacterium." src="assets/Tutorial20_cyanobacterium.jpg" title="Figure 4. A Cyanobacterium." /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Prokaryotes and Oxygen&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may be hard to envision life without oxygen, but the first prokaryotes (the first creatures on Earth) evolved in an environment with essentially no molecular oxygen (oxygen gas, or O2). Consequently, the first prokaryotes, which originated between 3.5 and 4 billion years ago, were &lt;strong&gt;anaerobic&lt;/strong&gt;. Anaerobic is a general term that refers to any organism, environment, or cellular process that lacks or does not require oxygen, and can even be poisoned by oxygen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original anaerobic organisms thrived in an environment devoid of oxygen. Many scientists think that the early prokaryotes were chemoautotrophs, obtaining energy from inorganic chemicals, possibly using the then-abundant hydrogen sulfide (H2S). Evidence to support this hypothesis can be observed in some hot springs, which contain members of the Archaea. They obtain energy from the combining of ferrous sulfide (FeS) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) in a redox reaction, which releases energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FeS + H2S --&gt; FeS2 + H2&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cyanobacteria, originating between 2.5 and 3.4 billion years ago, were the first photosynthetic bacteria to use water (H2O) as an electron source. They released oxygen as a waste product. These photosynthetic organisms thrived wherever there was sufficient light and a body of water. However, this created a problem on a global scale. After several hundred million years, free oxygen began to accumulate in the atmosphere, which marks the change from a reducing to an oxidizing atmosphere. Initially the high levels of free oxygen were toxic to life. Several mechanisms evolved to take care of this problem; including the use of oxygen in metabolism. Because we need oxygen for our survival, it is hard to believe that oxygen is toxic to many life forms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today prokaryotes (and other life forms) exhibit various metabolic relationships with oxygen. &lt;strong&gt;Obligate aerobes&lt;/strong&gt; require oxygen, whereas &lt;strong&gt;obligate anaerobes&lt;/strong&gt; have no need for oxygen and may even be poisoned by oxygen. &lt;strong&gt;Facultative anaerobes&lt;/strong&gt; can alternate their oxygen requirement. They can use oxygen if it is present, but they can also function in an anaerobic environment. In the upcoming tutorials on energy and cellular respiration, the role of oxygen in cellular processes and how anaerobic organisms get by without oxygen will be addressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="0" src="http://c.gigcount.com/wildfire/IMP/CXNID=2000002.0NXC/bT*xJmx*PTEzMDg5NDUxNzQ5NDcmcHQ9MTMwODk*NTE3OTkzOSZwPTIwNjQyMSZkPWIyMTI4NTAxJmc9MiZvPTk2NjhhNGRlZDA4/NDRmNzlhYTY1ZTI4N2RlOTA2Y2E4Jm9mPTA=.gif" style="visibility:hidden;width:0px;height:0px;" width="0" /&gt;&lt;object height="480" width="640"&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2128501" /&gt;&lt;param name="wmode" value="transparent" /&gt;&lt;embed height="480" src="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2128501" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="640" wmode="transparent"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Summary&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tutorial presented the diversity of prokaryotic carbon sources. Bacteria can use simple sugars, as well as complex sources of carbon. Some bacteria can live off oil, and some can decompose cellulose. The ability to breakdown complex carbon sources has been utilized for a variety of purposes. The field of bioremediation is based, to a large extent, on the use of bacteria that can breakdown harmful compounds that have been introduced into the environment from various industrial and agricultural sources. For example, bacteria are capable of breaking down TNT and PCBs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A great deal of life on the planet depends on prokaryotes, either directly or indirectly. The saprophytes degrade material from dead organic matter, and in doing so make nitrogen and carbon available to other life forms. Without them, nutrients would quickly be tied up in the carcasses of dead organisms and unavailable for other organisms in the ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nitrogen is necessary for the synthesis of amino acids. As with carbon, bacteria obtain their nitrogen from various sources. Some bacteria can convert ammonia into a more useful form of nitrogen (like nitrates and nitrites). Saprophytic bacteria obtain their nitrogen from decaying organic matter, whereas nitrogen-fixing bacteria obtain their nitrogen from molecular nitrogen (N2) found in the atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cyanobacteria not only fix their own nitrogen from the air, but they also synthesize their own sugars from carbon dioxide, using sunlight as an energy source. They may be the most efficient form of life on the planet. Indeed, the ancestors of blue-green algae played an important role in the history of the planet because their photosynthetic activity converted our planet&amp;#39;s early anaerobic environment into one that is oxygen rich.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also examined the relationships between oxygen and metabolism, and in the next few tutorials we will explore, in more detail, the relationship between energy and metabolic processes.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h1 style="text-align: left;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Introduction and Goals&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tutorial will explore metabolic regulation by focusing on the glycolytic component of cellular respiration. Although all of the metabolic processes that occur in cells are regulated, cellular respiration especially provides excellent examples of regulatory mechanisms. You will learn some basics about how enzymes control metabolism, and then look more closely at the enzymatic regulation of glycolysis. You will also learn more about mitochondria (the organelles where much of cellular respiration takes place) and some current thoughts about their origins. By the end of this tutorial you should be familiar with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The mechanisms of allosteric regulation&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The mechanisms of feedback inhibition&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The inhibition and stimulation of enzyme activity&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The enzymatic control of cellular metabolism&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The endosymbiont theory of the origin of mitochondria&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The selective pressures that might have favored the acquisition of mitochondria&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Overview of Cellular Respiration&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;Before we discuss the regulation of cellular respiration, the entire process will be reviewed. This figure provides a good review of the process. Be sure that you understand where the main reactions occur within a eukaryotic cell and how the various components work together to insure optimal transduction of energy. Recall, cellular respiration involves glycolysis, the Krebs cycle, and the electron transport chain. Glycolysis, which takes place in the cytosol of cells, breaks down single molecules of glucose into twin molecules of the compound pyruvate. In addition, a small amount of ATP (the energetic currency of cellular metabolism) is released in this process. A catabolite of pyruvate, acetyl CoA, is fed into the Krebs cycle. The Krebs cycle is a collection of enzymes located in the mitochondrion (plural, mitochondria). These enzymes convert acetyl CoA further (again, producing a small amount of ATP directly) and generate the highly reduced compounds NADH and FADH2, which, in turn, send their electrons through the electron transport chain in the mitochondrial membrane (where they are typically donated eventually to oxygen). The energy generated by the flow of electrons causes the buildup of a hydrogen gradient across this membrane, representing an enormous store of potential energy in the form of a charge differential (voltage). The charge differential is dissipated when hydrogen ions flow through the membrane via molecules of ATP synthase, which use their energy to form a relatively large amount of ATP by oxidative phosphorylation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 1.  An Overview of Cellular Respiration." src="assets/Tutorial24_respiration_overview.jpg" title="Figure 1.  An Overview of Cellular Respiration." /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Catalysis I - Activation Energy&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How is cellular respiration regulated? For that matter, how is any biochemical process regulated? Must cells wait for reactions to occur spontaneously? Recall, chemical reactions that release free energy are called exergonic reactions. Exergonic reactions release energy, whereas endergonic reactions require (absorb) energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 2. Spontaneous reactions require an input of energy." src="assets/Tutorial24_activation_energy.jpg" title="Figure 2. Spontaneous reactions require an input of energy." /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;Every working cell depends on thousands of exergonic reactions that, by definition, occur spontaneously. Do not confuse spontaneity with instantaneous. In fact, many spontaneous reactions take a long time to occur. This is because some activation energy is required to start a reaction. This figure shows the path of an exergonic reaction. Importantly, note that the free energy of the reaction rises before it falls at the completion of the reaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even exergonic reactions require some input of energy, which is referred to as &lt;strong&gt;activation energy&lt;/strong&gt;. This energy is needed to break bonds in the reactant molecules, then even more energy is released (in an exergonic reaction) when the bonds in the product molecules form. Some reactions have activation energy barriers that are sufficiently low enough to allow them to take place at room temperature, but most reactions require the input of more energy before they will occur. This is not an abstract concept. The oxidation of wood by oxygen (during burning) is a highly exergonic reaction, and will occur spontaneously. Luckily for those of us living in wood houses, a high activation energy is required for this reaction to occur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cells must overcome numerous activation energy barriers in order to carry out metabolic processes. This is not done by applying extra energy to reactions to speed them up, but by employing protein &lt;strong&gt;catalysts&lt;/strong&gt; called &lt;strong&gt;enzymes&lt;/strong&gt; to facilitate reactions. Enzymes do not add energy; instead, they hasten reactions by lowering the activation energy necessary so that the reactions can occur at normal metabolic temperatures. This figure shows the energetic relationship between an enzymatically catalyzed reaction and one that is not catalyzed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Catalysis II - The Enzyme-Substrate Complex&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;The three-dimensional shape of an enzyme renders it highly specific and allows it to act only on a certain type of molecule, its &lt;strong&gt;substrate&lt;/strong&gt;. Substrates fit into the &lt;strong&gt;active site&lt;/strong&gt; of an enzyme, much like a key fits into a lock. As shown in this figure, a substrate binds to an enzyme&amp;#39;s active site, where it is held in a position that initially promotes the breaking of chemical bonds, and later the formation of new bonds associated with the product. The unit that forms when an enzyme and its substrate(s) join is the &lt;strong&gt;enzyme-substrate complex&lt;/strong&gt;. Products are made and released after the enzyme-substrate complex forms, and afterwards the enzyme emerges unchanged from the reaction. Most importantly, the activation energy required for the catalyzed reaction was decreased.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 3. Enzymes are highly specific in their action." src="assets/Tutorial24_enzyme_specificity.jpg" title="Figure 3. Enzymes are highly specific in their action." /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sugar contained in sport drinks is most likely sucrose. Sucrose (a disaccharide) is broken down into the smaller sugars (monosaccharides) glucose and fructose by the enzyme sucrase. Sucrase has only one role in the cell. For example, it is not capable of switching functions and breaking down the sugar lactose. The fit between an enzyme and its substrate is very specific, and each enzyme can catalyze only one kind of reaction involving a specific substrate or set of substrates. Therefore, thousands of different enzymes can be required to perform all of a cell&amp;#39;s metabolic processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are enzymes that catalyze just about every reaction you can think of. There are even companies that specialize in putting enzymes to industrial use. Visit &lt;a href="http://www.novozymes.com/en" rel="_blank"&gt;Novozymes&lt;/a&gt; for an example of such a company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Metabolic Regulation I - Coenzymes&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enzymatic activity is influenced by many things that are not mutually exclusive. For example, temperature and pH can have profound effects on enzymes. Increases in temperature tend to increase reaction rates until a point is reached at which the bonds stabilizing the three-dimensional structure of an enzyme start to degrade, hence denaturing the protein and disrupting the conformation of its active site. Likewise, changes in pH can affect the stability of chemical bonds and the integrity of active sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many cases, enzymes must be accompanied by &lt;strong&gt;coenzymes&lt;/strong&gt;, which are not themselves catalysts but are required for normal catalytic functioning of the enzyme. If cells are deficient in certain coenzymes, their associated enzymes will not work properly. The vitamins and minerals that are essential in our diets are often coenzymes or they are the raw materials required to manufacture these important compounds. One such substance, &lt;a href="http://cancernet.nci.nih.gov/cancertopics/pdq/cam/coenzymeQ10" rel="_blank"&gt;coenzyme Q10&lt;/a&gt;, has received much attention recently for its role as a powerful antioxidant and its potential as a treatment for cancer (though much of this attention is still based on speculation).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most common forms of metabolic regulation is &lt;strong&gt;feedback inhibition&lt;/strong&gt;, whereby a reaction&amp;#39;s end products inhibit the reaction itself by halting it when a certain amount of product has accumulated. Feedback inhibition is accomplished in two ways: via &lt;strong&gt;allosteric regulation&lt;/strong&gt; (noncompetitive inhibition), whereby an inhibitor binds to a site distant from the active site and causes a conformational change in the enzyme thereby decreasing its ability to bind with the substrate and hence catalyze the reaction, or via competitive inhibition where the inhibitor binds to the active site, directly preventing the formation of an enzyme-substrate complex. &lt;img alt="Figure 4.  Enzyme Substrate and Binding Inhibition." src="assets/Tutorial24_binding_inhibition.jpg" title="Figure 4.  Enzyme Substrate and Binding Inhibition." /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Allosteric enzymes&lt;/strong&gt; are generally intricate molecules, composed of at least two protein subunits; conformational changes occur when allosteric sites are filled, thereby changing the shape of the active site itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;Allosteric regulation can involve stimulation of enzyme activity and feedback inhibition. Certain allosteric sites bind activators, which leads to changes that stabilize an enzyme&amp;#39;s active site, and thus increase its affinity for substrate. This figure illustrates how allosteric enzymes can be either activated or inhibited. Note the importance of the 3-D conformation in both processes; activators serve to expose the enzyme&amp;#39;s active site, whereas inhibitors change the enzyme&amp;#39;s conformation so that the substrate cannot bind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Glycolysis is a Dynamic Process&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you&amp;#39;ve learned, glycolysis converts glucose to pyruvate through a series of steps. Each step has its own enzyme that catalyses the particular reaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phosphofructokinase&lt;/strong&gt; (PFK) is an important enzyme that is involved in the early stages of glycolysis. It belongs to a family of enzymes known as &lt;strong&gt;kinases&lt;/strong&gt;. Kinases move phosphate groups from energy-containing molecules (e.g., ATP) to other organic molecules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phosphofructokinase removes a phosphate from ATP and transfers it to an intermediate product, fructose 6-phosphate, thereby transforming this compound into the more symmetrical molecule fructose 1, 6-bisphosphate. &lt;img alt="Figure 5.  The Dynamics of Glycolysis." src="assets/Tutorial24_glycolysis_dynamics.jpg" title="Figure 5.  The Dynamics of Glycolysis." /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subsequent reactions, catalyzed by different enzymes, cleave the new molecule in two and ultimately produce two pyruvate molecules (one for each half of the fructose 1,6-bisphosphate) as the glycolytic end product. Phosphofructokinase is a critical enzyme in the glycolytic pathway because it represents the first point of metabolic regulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;You should recognize that phosphofructokinase is an allosteric enzyme. That is, it has allosteric sites that bind inhibitors and activators, influencing the affinity of the active site for the substrate fructose 6-phosphate. As shown in this figure, ATP and citrate inhibit the activity of this enzyme, and thus slow the progression of glycolysis. Conversely, AMP (adenosine monophosphate) stimulates phosphofructokinase activity and sets glycolysis in motion. The figure below shows the relationship between the overall shape of the phosphofructokinase enzyme, the location of the substrate binding site (central), and the inhibitor/activation sites (left/right).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Why Regulate Glycolysis?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why would an organism need to regulate glycolysis? Or, put another way, what would be the selective advantage of regulating this process? Glycolysis is the first component of cellular respiration; it produces raw materials for the Krebs cycle, and ultimately the electron transport chain (which operates to provide cells with the ATP they need for metabolic processes). ATP and the compounds required for its synthesis are of great importance, but cells would not be operating at peak efficiency if they produced pyruvate constantly. During times of low activity, energy requirements are less, and therefore there is no need to divert valuable organic molecules into either ATP or the intermediates of cellular respiration. In other words, when ATP levels are high, there is little need for pyruvate; therefore, glycolysis can be restricted for the time being; accordingly, high ATP levels inhibit phosphofructokinase. The activity of this enzyme is also inhibited by citrate, a product of the Krebs cycle. This allows cells to coordinate the rates of glycolysis and the Krebs cycle, slowing down pyruvate production if the Krebs cycle gets too far ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 6.  The enzyme Phosphofructokinase (PFK)." src="assets/Tutorial24_PFK.jpg" title="Figure 6.  The enzyme Phosphofructokinase (PFK)." /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conversely, high levels of AMP stimulate phosphofructokinase activity. When ATP is low, ADP is inevitably high, and therefore some of this ADP is converted into AMP. High levels of AMP indicate that ATP is in short supply and that it needs to be regenerated. By &quot;turning on&quot; glycolysis, the cell can increase the production of compounds that feed into the Krebs cycle and the electron transport chain, thus elevating the rate of ATP synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metabolically, glycolysis is an open system. This means that molecules can enter or leave at any point. Enzymatic pathways are not simple linear progressions; they are dynamic processes that are typically regulated at many intermediate points, depending on the immediate needs of the cell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The Localization of Enzymes&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This diagram depicts only a fraction of the metabolic pathways in a cell. Dots represent molecules, and lines represent chemical reactions. There are thousands of enzymes in most eukaryotic cells. This figure illustrates the various pathways that interconnect cellular respiration with other reactions. The compartmentalization of enzymes increases the efficiency of reactions and prevents enzymes from getting lost in the shuffle of cellular metabolism. For example, the helicases that unwind the double helix of DNA, in preparation for replication, are concentrated in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells, where they are utilized during the replication process. If they simply diffused freely throughout the cell and if replication depended on rare chance encounters between double helices and helicases, replication would occur with far less efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 7.  Cellular metabolism." src="assets/Tutorial24_metabolism.jpg" title="Figure 7.  Cellular metabolism." /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, many of the enzymes involved in cellular respiration are concentrated at specific sites within cells. For example, while glycolytic enzymes are found in the cytosol, the enzymes involved in the Krebs cycle are located within the mitochondrial matrix. Enzymes of the electron transport chain are actually imbedded within the inner membrane of mitochondria, where they are clustered in functional groups, allowing reactions to take place in sequence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conversely, high levels of AMP stimulate phosphofructokinase activity. When ATP is low, ADP is inevitably high, and therefore some of this ADP is converted into AMP. High levels of AMP indicate that ATP is in short supply and that it needs to be regenerated. By &quot;turning on&quot; glycolysis, the cell can increase the production of compounds that feed into the Krebs cycle and the electron transport chain, thus elevating the rate of ATP synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metabolically, glycolysis is an open system. This means that molecules can enter or leave at any point. Enzymatic pathways are not simple linear progressions; they are dynamic processes that are typically regulated at many intermediate points, depending on the immediate needs of the cell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The Origins of Eukaryotic Metabolic Complexity&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metabolic regulation is sophisticated and intricate, controlled in fine detail by enzymes. These catalysts oversee cellular respiration, along with an overwhelming majority of metabolic processes in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. The automation, integration, and incredible complexity of enzymatically driven reactions facilitate life. They regulate events like the transformation of soil nutrients and solar energy into plant tissue, which can then go into the flesh of animals like this Thompson&amp;#39;s gazelle, and finally, into predators like this hunting cheetah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 8.  Predator-prey relationships are metabolically regulated." src="assets/Tutorial24_predator_prey.jpg" title="Figure 8.  Predator-prey relationships are metabolically regulated." /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;The organization orchestrated by enzymes also bestows upon higher organisms (e.g., humans) the capacity for rational thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 9. Rational Thought is Metabolically Regulated." src="assets/Tutorial24_thinker.jpg" title="Figure 9. Rational Thought is Metabolically Regulated." /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where did this sophisticated organization come from? How is it that life, in particular eukaryotic life, was able to evolve such a diverse and astonishing array of finely tuned metabolic functions? One possibility is that the acquisition of mitochondria by eukaryotes allowed the efficient production of large quantities of ATP, thus making it possible for emerging lineages of eukaryotic organisms to support elaborate functions that require energy (e.g., motility).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next we will discuss mitochondrial structure and current thoughts about mitochondrial evolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The Mitochondrion&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mitochondria are present in the cells of most eukaryotes. As you&amp;#39;ve learned, they are a site of ATP synthesis. They are also quite abundant; some cells contain a single large mitochondrion, but most eukaryotic cells contain many more. Cells that require a great deal of energy (e.g., muscle cells) can house thousands of mitochondria. The basic structure of a mitochondrion is depicted here. Mitochondria are enclosed in a double membrane; a smooth outer membrane and an inner membrane that is contorted into a complex of infoldings called cristae. Cristae provide extensive surface areas for processes such as the electron transport chain, which takes place within the inner membrane. This membrane typically contains thousands of copies of electron transport chain proteins. The space within the cristae is the mitochondrial matrix. Recall, this is where the Krebs cycle occurs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 10. The structure of a mitochondrion." src="assets/Tutorial24_mitochondrion.jpg" title="Figure 10. The structure of a mitochondrion." /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mitochondria also possess their own genetic material in the form of circular DNA (which, as you will learn, provides an important clue as to how mitochondria arose). Mitochondria and their genetic material are maternally inherited in sexually reproducing organisms. (The sperm mitochondria rarely enter the egg during fertilization.) Therefore, mitochondria are passed to offspring in the cytoplasm of ova. Hence, your mitochondria are virtually identical to your mother&amp;#39;s. There are many fascinating consequences associated with this phenomenon. For example, a number of &lt;a href="http://www.umdf.org/site/c.dnJEKLNqFoG/b.3041929/k.BF32/Home.htm" rel="_blank"&gt;maternally inherited diseases&lt;/a&gt; are caused by defective genes in mitochondria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a close-up look at mitochondria (plus chloroplasts and a nucleus), see the &lt;a href="http://www.life.illinois.edu/cgi-bin/plantbio/cell/cell.cgi" rel="_blank"&gt;Virtual Cell&lt;/a&gt;. Select &quot;mitochondrion&quot; or &quot;cristae&quot; in the pull-down menu and click on the image. Keep clicking or use the buttons on the right to navigate through the cell. If you are having trouble, select &quot;About Virtual Cell&quot; for information on how to explore the site. Be prepared to answer some questions about the organization of mitochondria when you return, with special reference to where the electron transport chain is located.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The Endosymbiont Theory&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is thought that mitochondria evolved from prokaryotes that inhabited the cells of other larger prokaryotes. This scenario likely originated as an &lt;strong&gt;endosymbiosis&lt;/strong&gt;, in which one organism began living within the body of another. (This type of association is very common.) Put simply, it is thought that a relatively large prokaryote (a protoeukaryote) engulfed a smaller prokaryote (a protomitochondrion), and instead of the larger consuming the smaller, they formed an everlasting relationship. This engulfment would account for the existence of the inner membrane of mitochondria (the ancestral prokaryotic membrane) and the outer membrane. The symbiosis was mutualistic because it benefited both the protoeukaryote and the protomitochondrion; the protomitochondrion was provided with a safe environment and plenty of raw materials for respiration, and the protoeukaryote was provided with a rich, free supply of fuel in the form of ATP and some safety from the oxidizing power of O2; to be discussed in the next section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 11. Endosymbiosis." src="assets/Tutorial24_endosymbiosis.jpg" title="Figure 11. Endosymbiosis.  A typical eukaryotic cell contains a variety of organelles, some of which are of prokaryotic origin." /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chloroplasts, which are found in eukaryotic photosynthetic cells, might also have originated from an ancient symbiosis. In the case of chloroplasts, however, the prokaryote was photosynthetic (probably an ancient cyanobacterium; discussed later in this tutorial). In this case, the ancestors to the modern cells that possess both mitochondria and chloroplasts, at some point in the past, underwent a &lt;strong&gt;serial endosymbiosis&lt;/strong&gt; (sequential endosymbiotic events).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Evidence for the Endosymbiont Theory&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evidence for the endosymbiont theory is strong. Most convincingly, mitochondria closely resemble &lt;strong&gt;extant&lt;/strong&gt; (currently existing) bacteria. Mitochondria are similar in size, and they replicate in a fashion that is very similar to binary fission. Also, the inner membrane of mitochondria bears a strong resemblance to the membranes of prokaryotes, sharing several key proteins and transport systems. Additionally, mitochondria have their own DNA (which takes the form of a circular plasmid, like that of prokaryotes) and they possess all of the cellular machinery required to transcribe and translate their genomes, thereby enabling them to produce their own proteins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The character of mitochondrial DNA is much like that seen in modern-day prokaryotes. For example, mitochondrial DNA lack histones, which are associated with eukaryotic nuclear DNA but not with prokaryotic DNA. Additionally, mitochondrial ribosomes are more similar in behavior, structure, and nucleic acid base sequence to the ribosomes of prokaryotes than they are to eukaryotic ribosomes. For example, there is high sequence similarity between the ribosomal RNA of mitochondria and that of modern endosymbiotic bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The relationship between mitochondria and eukaryotes has grown so intimate that neither can exist without the other. Most mitochondrial genes are contained within the nucleus of their eukaryotic host cells, which makes mitochondria unable to reproduce and survive independently. Likewise, eukaryotes (e.g., humans) would be unable to manufacture enough ATP to sustain life without the help of mitochondria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Selective Pressures Favoring Symbiosis&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometime before 2.2-2.3 billion years ago, &lt;strong&gt;cyanobacteria&lt;/strong&gt; evolved the ability to use H2O and CO2 to make organic molecules with the help of solar energy, in a process known as photosynthesis. The primary &quot;waste&quot; product from this type of photosynthesis is O2, which began to accumulate in the atmosphere due to the activity of cyanobacteria. Other earlier forms of photosynthesis probably relied on H2S rather than H2O and did not result in the release of O2. For millions of years, cyanobacterial photosynthesis did not change the Earth&amp;#39;s atmosphere; oxygen released by photosynthesizing mats of marine cyanobacteria combined with iron ions in the ocean, forming iron oxide that precipitated to the sea floor. When these iron ions were depleted, oxygen began to accumulate in seawater and eventually it diffused into the atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 12.   A Cyanobacteria." src="assets/Tutorial24_Anabaena_sperica2.jpg" title="Figure 12.   A Cyanobacteria.  This blue-green alga is one type of cyanobacteria." /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The change in atmospheric composition due to cyanobacteria was enormous, even more severe than the pollution associated with industrialized civilization. Oxygen is a powerful oxidizer, and its tendency to strip electrons and attack the bonds of organic molecules can be very dangerous to living organisms. The atmospheric changes effected by cyanobacteria probably resulted in numerous extinctions, but conversely, they also led to novel adaptations (e.g., the production of antioxidants). Furthermore, some organisms also evolved the ability to detoxify oxygen by reducing it with electrons from other molecules. Electron transport chains, such as the ones that exist in modern-day mitochondria, might have evolved as mechanisms for counteracting the destructive effects of O2, secondarily becoming a means of energy production over evolutionary time. The ancestors of eukaryotes might have gained an advantage in an oxygen-rich atmosphere by adopting endosymbionts to detoxify O2. The additional benefit that eukaryotes enjoy today, ATP synthesis, might be a derived function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 13.  An Algal Bloom." src="assets/Tutorial24_algal_bloom.jpg" title="Figure 13.  An Algal Bloom.  This pond is located in San Francisco's Japanese Tea Garden in Golden Gate Park." /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Summary&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tutorial addressed the regulation of metabolism. Metabolism is regulated at a number of steps. Consider the enzyme phosphofructokinase, which is not always active. Cellular control is obtained via a feedback inhibition, by which high levels of ATP (or citrate) lead to a decrease in the catalytic activity of the enzyme. This form of control means that ATP production only occurs when the level of ATP (or citrate) falls below a certain level. This mechanism helps the cell produce only that amount of ATP needed at any given time. Conversely, as ATP usage goes up (and ATP levels fall), the enzyme works more effectively, allowing more ATP to be produced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In most eukaryotic cells, the majority of ATP is produced in the mitochondria. Eukaryotic cells are more complex than prokaryotic cells, and this complexity is largely due to the appearance of discrete membrane-bound compartments in which various cellular processes are compartmentalized. In prokaryotes, most cellular processes occur within one compartment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The available data indicate that two major evolutionary processes have contributed to the complexity of eukaryotic cells. First, it appears that the plasma membrane has undergone various modifications. These invaginations have resulted in complex intracellular compartments such as lysosomes, the endoplasmic reticulum, and golgi apparatuses. The majority of DNA is found within a membrane-bound nucleus. Second, the mitochondria seem to be of prokaryotic origin. There is compelling data to indicate that during the early evolution of eukaryotes, an intimate association occurred between a primitive prokaryote and a primitive eukaryote. This intracellular symbiosis became permanent over the course of time, and what exists today is a stable remnant of that ancient association.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a quote by Lewis Thomas from his classic book of essays, The Lives of a Cell, which puts these facts in a provocative context:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;A good case can be made for our nonexistence as entities. We are not made up, as we had always supposed, of successively enriched packets of our own parts. We are shared, rented, occupied. At the interior of our cells, driving them, providing the oxidative energy that sends us out for the improvement of each shining day, are the mitochondria, and in a strict sense, they are not ours. They turn out to be little separate creatures, the colonial posterity of migrant prokaryocytes, probably primitive bacteria that swam into ancestral precursors of our eukaryotic cells and stayed there. Ever since, they have maintained themselves and their ways, replicating in their own fashion, privately, with their own DNA and RNA quite different from ours. They are as much symbionts as the rhizobial bacteria in the roots of beans. Without them, we would not move a muscle, drum a finger, think a thought....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Introduction and Goals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In tutorial 24 you were introduced to the evolution of eukaryotic cells via endosymbiosis and you have already learned about the structure and function of the mitochondria.&amp;nbsp; This tutorial will focus on other aspects of the subcellular architecture of a eukaryotic cell and how the specialization of these structures helps cells carry out their normal functions. By the end of this tutorial you should have a basic working understanding of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li class="content"&gt;Subcellular organization in eukaryotic cells&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li class="content"&gt;Protein trafficking through the endomembrane system&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li class="content"&gt;The role of the cytoskeleton in cell structure and function&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Introduction to the Subcellular Organization of Eukaryotic Cells&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eukaryotic cells contain a number of membrane-bound organelles. These structures play important roles in the normal functioning of cells. They participate in everything from constructing and exporting newly synthesized biological molecules to protecting the cell from invading pathogens. The main structures that will be examined in this tutorial can be found in the figure shown here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a assets/Tutorial26_animal_cell.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 1.  A simplified diagram of an animal cell." class="lightbox" src="assets/Tutorial26_animal_cell.jpg" style="height: 201px; width: 300px;" title="Figure 1.  A simplified diagram of an animal cell." /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Nucleus&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;nucleus&lt;/strong&gt; is one of the most visible organelles in the cell. While it is usually only about 5 microns in diameter (approximately 1/20th the thickness of a human hair), it plays a central role in providing genetic information to the cell. The nucleus is surrounded by a double membrane called the nuclear envelope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 2.  A simplified diagram of a nucleus." src="assets/Tutorial26_nucleus.jpg" title="Figure 2.  A simplified diagram of a nucleus." /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	The nucleus also houses the nucleolus (depicted above). The &lt;strong&gt;nucleolus&lt;/strong&gt; contains a very active group of genes that encode and transcribe ribosomal RNA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Major Roles of the Nucleus&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most notable function of the nucleus is to store the major source of genetic material within every eukaryotic cell, namely the nuclear chromosomes (additional genetic information is also found within mitochondria and chloroplasts). In addition to storage, the nucleus is also the site of all gene expression. If a new protein is to be made, a gene must first be transcribed to messenger RNA in the nucleus. Once transcribed, messenger RNA exits the nucleus through &lt;strong&gt;nuclear pores&lt;/strong&gt; in the nuclear envelope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Endomembrane System&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many important steps in protein synthesis. Remember, you learned about protein translation in the section titled &lt;a href="https://online.science.psu.edu/biol110_sandbox_2381/node/8957"&gt;From Gene to Protein&lt;/a&gt;. Most proteins require a number of post-translational modifications before they become functional. These modifications do not occur spontaneously and they require specialized cellular structures. Protein targeting and processing takes place in a network of membrane-bound chambers called the &lt;strong&gt;endomembrane system&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;endoplasmic reticulum&lt;/strong&gt;, which literally means &quot;network within the cytoplasm.&quot; There are two types of endoplasmic reticulum in the cell: a &lt;strong&gt;smooth endoplasmic reticulum&lt;/strong&gt; and a &lt;strong&gt;rough endoplasmic reticulum&lt;/strong&gt;. The smooth endoplasmic reticulum plays a major role in synthesizing lipids and in degrading toxins. The rough endoplasmic reticulum houses ribosomes on its surface, which is where many of the proteins targeted for export are synthesized. More specifically, the process begins in a network called the &lt;strong&gt;endoplasmic reticulum&lt;/strong&gt;, which literally means &quot;network within the cytoplasm.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 3.  A simplified diagram of the endomembrane system." src="assets/Tutorial26_endomembrane.jpg" title="Figure 3.  A simplified diagram of the endomembrane system." /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Protein Targeting to the Rough Endoplasmic Reticulum&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proteins often contain signal sequences that facilitate their sorting within the cell. Newly synthesized proteins destined for export have a unique &lt;strong&gt;signal sequence&lt;/strong&gt; that directs them to the rough endoplasmic reticulum. This figure illustrates the sorting process. If a translational complex (1) has a growing protein with this sequence at its N-terminus (the end that is synthesized first), then a &lt;strong&gt;signal recognition particle&lt;/strong&gt; (SRP) binds to the growing polypeptide (2). The SRP facilitates association with the rough ER, and the translational complex docks to the rough ER at a specific receptor site located within rough ER pore complexes (3). The growing polypeptide is then inserted through the pore and translation continues; note: the polypeptide is now being inserted into the lumen of the rough ER as it is synthesized (4). Specific peptidases inside the lumen recognize the signal sequence and this short stretch is removed (5). Once translation is completed, the translational complex dissociates, leaving the newly synthesized protein inside the rough ER.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 4.  Protein Sorting into the Rough ER." src="assets/Tutorial26_protein_targeting.jpg" title="Figure 4.  Protein Sorting into the Rough ER." /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scientist who discovered signal peptides and their role in protein trafficking was awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine for his work. You can read more about this at the &lt;a href="http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1999/blobel-lecture.html" rel="_blank"&gt;Nobel Prize Web site&lt;/a&gt;. Take a look at the illustrated presentation at the Nobel Web page and when you return be prepared to answer a question on a disease caused by defective protein targeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Golgi Apparatus Modifies Proteins&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Golgi apparatus&lt;/strong&gt; is an endomembrane system involved in processing proteins. Named for its discoverer, Camillo Golgi, the Golgi apparatus is where carbohydrates are added to proteins in a process called &lt;strong&gt;glycosylation&lt;/strong&gt;. Proteins move from the rough endoplasmic reticulum in small membrane-bound transport vesicles to the Golgi apparatus (depicted above). The side of the Golgi apparatus where proteins enter is referred to as the &lt;strong&gt;cis face&lt;/strong&gt;; it can be thought of as the receiving end of the Golgi apparatus. Transport vesicles, containing partially processed proteins, bud from the folds of the Golgi apparatus (&lt;strong&gt;cisternae&lt;/strong&gt;) on the cis face and fuse with cisternae on the more distal side (&lt;strong&gt;trans face&lt;/strong&gt;). In this manner, proteins traverse the Golgi apparatus as they are prepared for transport to their final destinations (either within the cell or for export outside of the cell).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 5.  A simplified diagram of the Golgi apparatus." src="assets/Tutorial26_golgi.jpg" title="Figure 5.  A simplified diagram of the Golgi apparatus." /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Protein Export&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a protein is fully processed, glycosylated and ready for export, it next makes the trip from the endomembrane system to the cell&amp;#39;s plasma membrane or other internal compartments (e.g., a lysosome). Recall from &lt;a href="https://online.science.psu.edu/biol110_sandbox_2381/node/8971" title="Tutorial 19 - Prokaryotes II -Structure and Function"&gt;Prokaryotes II, Structure and Function&lt;/a&gt;, the plasma membrane consists of a phospholipid bilayer that is selectively permeable. The final transport vesicle that buds from the trans face of the Golgi apparatus is termed a &lt;strong&gt;secretory vesicle&lt;/strong&gt; (shown here). Secretory vesicles bind and fuse with the internal face of the plasma membrane by interacting with specific membrane proteins. There are several steps in this process: first, the vesicle must dock on the membrane; second, it must be primed for fusion; third, it must fuse with the membrane that will release its contents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 6.  Protein Export and Secretory Vesicles." src="assets/Tutorial26_protein_export.jpg" title="Figure 6.  Protein Export and Secretory Vesicles." /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What Holds Everything In the Cell Together?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The inside of a cell is much more than a limp sack of watery cytoplasm and organelles. Within the cytoplasm is a complex scaffold of proteins that comprise the cytoskeleton. The cytoskeleton is made up of three major components: microfilaments, intermediate filaments, and microtubules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 7.  A Microfilament Composed of Actin Subunits." src="assets/Tutorial26_microfilaments.jpg" title="Figure 7.  A Microfilament Composed of Actin Subunits." /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The smallest cytoskeletal fibers are &lt;strong&gt;microfilaments&lt;/strong&gt; (shown here), made of polymerized subunits of the globular protein &lt;strong&gt;actin&lt;/strong&gt;, which are strung together like beads on a string. Microfilaments play a critical role in cell motility, where they facilitate cellular migration or, as in the case of muscle cells, contraction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 8.  Intermediate filaments." src="assets/Tutorial26_intermediate_filaments.jpg" title="Figure 8.  Intermediate filaments." /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the name implies, &lt;strong&gt;intermediate filaments&lt;/strong&gt; are somewhat larger than microfilaments, yet smaller than microtubules. Intermediate filaments are made of fibrous proteins wrapped around one another to form a thick, cable-like structure. Just as cables are specialized to withstand large forces, intermediate filaments play an important role in supporting cell structures and anchoring organelles in the correct position within the cell. Unlike microfilaments and microtubules, intermediate filaments are relatively static within the cell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 9.  Microtubules." src="assets/Tutorial26_microtubules.jpg" title="Figure 9.  Microtubules." /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Microtubules&lt;/strong&gt; are the largest cytoskeletal elements that we will discuss.&amp;nbsp; Microtubules are actually hollow tubes consisting of rows of paired tubulin molecules. Microtubules are very important to major cellular events (e.g., mitosis) and they also have a major structural role within the cell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might know that cancer cells are characterized by their rapid cell divisions. Given the importance of the cytoskeleton in cell division, it is the target of a number of cancer therapeutic drugs. However, one of the major problems with targeting the cytoskeleton with drug therapies is that there are many adverse side effects associated with these drugs. This is because the cytoskeleton plays important roles throughout the cell cycle. Several drug companies are actively searching for drugs that target the cytoskeletal elements specifically involved in dividing cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lysosomes and Vacuoles&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eukaryotes have a number of vesicular compartments that are used for a variety of purposes. One such compartment is the &lt;strong&gt;lysosome&lt;/strong&gt;. Lysosomes are involved in breaking down material. When vesicles bud off of the plasma membrane, bringing contents from outside the cell into the cytoplasm, they first fuse with lysosomes. Special &lt;strong&gt;hydrolytic enzymes&lt;/strong&gt; within lysosomes degrade material within the vesicles. The hydrolytic enzymes are initially synthesized in an inactive state, and only upon reaching the lysosome do they become activated. Because the active hydrolytic enzymes are compartmentalized within the lysosomes, only material within the lysosomes is degraded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 10.  An overview of lysosomes." src="assets/Tutorial26_lysosomes.jpg" title="Figure 10.  An overview of lysosomes." /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another organelle, the &lt;strong&gt;vacuole&lt;/strong&gt;, has a variety of roles in cells. In most animal cells, vacuoles are primarily storage organelles. In plant cells they store a variety of compounds and are used to control the osmotic pressure (&lt;strong&gt;turgor pressure&lt;/strong&gt;) of the cell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="0" src="http://c.gigcount.com/wildfire/IMP/CXNID=2000002.0NXC/bT*xJmx*PTEzMDk5MjEwNzU1NjYmcHQ9MTMwOTkyMTA3ODM3MiZwPTIwNjQyMSZkPWIyMTM2NDE3Jmc9MiZvPTk2NjhhNGRlZDA4/NDRmNzlhYTY1ZTI4N2RlOTA2Y2E4Jm9mPTA=.gif" style="visibility: hidden; width: 0px; height: 0px;" width="0" /&gt;&lt;object data="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2136417" height="480" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="640"&gt;&lt;param name="quality" value="high" /&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2136417" /&gt;&lt;param name="wmode" value="transparent" /&gt;&lt;embed height="480" hspace="10" quality="high" src="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2136417" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" vspace="10" width="640" wmode="transparent"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, you&amp;#39;ve learned that the subcellular architecture of a cell is highly specialized to ensure its well being. You have also learned how gene expression in the nucleus leads to protein synthesis and trafficking through the endomembrane system. Intracellular trafficking and cellular locomotion rely on the cytoskeleton, which works together with molecular motors to affect intracellular movement.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

&lt;h1&gt;Introduction and Goals&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Windmill Farm" src="assets/Tutorial21_windfarm.jpg" title="Windmill Farm" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the major characteristics of a living organism is that it can obtain and process energy. As you will learn, the basic principles of energy transduction are widely applicable and apply not just to life, but also to other transformations (e.g., those performed by these windmills). The basic molecules that constitute living organisms were discussed in Tutorial 16 (Carbon and Life). This tutorial will concentrate on how some biomolecules are used for energetic purposes, and will provide an overview of the basic rules that govern energy utilization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the end of this tutorial you should have a basic working understanding of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;What constitutes energy&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The relationship between chemical bonds and energy&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The first and second laws of thermodynamics&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The free energy equation&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The nature of ATP, and how it can be used to perform work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Metabolism and Energy&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 1. Metabolic Pathways in a Cell." src="assets/Tutorial21_metabolism.jpg" title="Figure 1. Metabolic Pathways in a Cell.  This diagram depicts only a fraction of the metabolic pathways in a cell. Dots represent molecules, and lines represent chemical reactions." /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This diagram depicts only a fraction of the metabolic pathways in a cell. Dots represent molecules, and lines represent chemical reactions. The straight line of large dots down the center is the catabolic breakdown of carbohydrates (glycolysis), and the large ring towards the bottom is the citric acid (or Krebs) cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Metabolism&lt;/strong&gt; refers to all of the chemical reactions that occur in an organism. This figure (left) maps some of the metabolic reactions involved in sugar metabolism. Metabolic reactions can be subdivided into those that result in the formation of molecules (anabolic) versus those that result in the breakdown of molecules (catabolic). Anabolism and catabolism were discussed in Tutorial 16. During photosynthesis, photoautotrophs (e.g., land plants) convert the energy found in sunlight into chemical energy via a series of anabolic reactions that result in starch being formed and stored within the plant. Chemoheterotrophs (e.g., humans) eat starch and break it down via a series of catabolic reactions to obtain the stored chemical energy. Before we discuss how these chemical reactions are used to move energy around the biosphere (and why), we need to define energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 2.  The Hoover Dam." src="assets/Tutorial21_hoover_dam.jpg" title="Figure 2.  The Hoover Dam." /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Energy&lt;/strong&gt; refers to that which can or does move matter (i.e., the capacity for doing work). Let&amp;#39;s consider two forms of energy. &lt;strong&gt;Kinetic energy&lt;/strong&gt; refers to energy that is associated with moving matter. &lt;strong&gt;Potential energy&lt;/strong&gt; refers to energy that is stored. Work is the act of moving matter, whether that matter is as small as an electron or as large as a whale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;Examples of potential and kinetic energy are all around us. For example, the Hoover Dam on the Colorado River(shown here) blocks the normal flow of water and stores potential energy behind its walls. When released, the kinetic energy of the swiftly flowing water is harnessed to provide electricity for 1.3 million people a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	There is also a connection between kinetic energy and temperature. The temperature of an object is a reflection of the kinetic energy of its atoms or molecules. Fast molecules = high kinetic energy = high temperature. Boiling water has a much higher temperature, and subsequently a higher kinetic energy than ice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Energy and Chemical Bonds&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand how metabolic reactions are used to transduce energy for life&amp;#39;s processes, one needs to appreciate some basics about the physical forces that allow two atoms to interact. Chemical bonds hold atoms together, and these bonds form as a result of electron behavior (either directly or indirectly). Electrons have mass, hence their movement requires energy. In addition, electrons contain varying amounts of potential energy. In the vast majority of metabolic reactions, it is the electrons that are the vehicle for moving energy. How does this happen?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s start with a common chemical reaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
	&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;Methane (CH4) + 2 oxygen (O2) ----&gt; Carbon dioxide (CO2) + 2 water (H2O)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This reaction takes place every time you turn on a gas stove. The reaction gives off energy in the form of heat and can be used to do work (e.g., boil water). In this reaction the chemical bonds associated with the four hydrogen atoms around the carbon atom must break, then reassociate with the electrons associated with oxygen. Note that it takes energy to break bonds; in this case, 632 kcal of energy are required for every mole of methane that reacts with two moles of oxygen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If energy is required, how does this reaction evolve heat energy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer is that bond formation produces heat. In this example, 792 kcal of energy evolve as the new bonds form in association with oxygen. The net gain is 792 - 632 = 160 kcal/mole of energy released by the reaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before ending this topic, let&amp;#39;s clarify some case-sensitive nomenclature. In everyday usage, energy is written in Calories (Cal, note the uppercase &quot;C&quot;), otherwise known as Nutritional Calories. 1 Calorie = 1,000 calories, or 1 kcal = 1 Calorie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="0" src="http://c.gigcount.com/wildfire/IMP/CXNID=2000002.0NXC/bT*xJmx*PTEzMDk1NTAyMzk3NjkmcHQ9MTMwOTU1MDI*MjE2NSZwPTIwNjQyMSZkPWIyMTM1NzYyJmc9MiZvPTk2NjhhNGRlZDA4/NDRmNzlhYTY1ZTI4N2RlOTA2Y2E4Jm9mPTA=.gif" style="visibility:hidden;width:0px;height:0px;" width="0" /&gt;&lt;object height="480" width="640"&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2135762" /&gt;&lt;param name="wmode" value="transparent" /&gt;&lt;embed height="480" src="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2135762" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="640" wmode="transparent"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Laws of Thermodynamics: The First Law&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;When glucose is broken down, there is an accompanying release of energy. How do organisms use this energy? Or, better yet, why do they even need energy? These not so trivial questions require an understanding of some important general laws that govern energy utilization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 3.  Heterotrophs need food for energy." src="assets/Tutorial21_energy.jpg" title="Figure 3.  Heterotrophs need food for energy." /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thermodynamics&lt;/strong&gt; is the physics of energy transformations that occur in a collection of matter. Formally, any collection of matter under thermodynamic scrutiny is defined as a &quot;system.&quot; Bioenergetics is the area of thermodynamics that deals specifically with the energetic reactions that occur in an organism; energetically, an organism is a &quot;system.&quot; There are a few laws that apply to energy (both biological and nonbiological). The laws of thermodynamics are actually quite simple, but have some far-reaching implications (not only to life, but to all interactions between energy and matter).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;first law of thermodynamics&lt;/strong&gt; states that energy is neither created nor destroyed. In other words, the amount of energy in the universe is constant. This concept is straightforward but can be confusing. You might have heard someone say that plants &quot;make energy from the sun.&quot; Plants actually convert solar energy (sunlight) into molecular potential energy, in the form of sugar. Remember, plants do not &quot;make&quot; energy. Photosynthesis converts light energy (a form of kinetic energy) into chemical energy. This first law could be considered &quot;bookkeeping.&quot; It states that the energy used and released in any reaction must be balanced. Note that the energy in one molecule can be distributed into two or more other molecules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Laws of Thermodynamics: The Second Law&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;second law of thermodynamics&lt;/strong&gt; deals with the ordering of matter and states that all energy-affected matter in the universe is becoming random. In other words, the total &lt;strong&gt;entropy&lt;/strong&gt; (S) in the universe is increasing. There is a very important relationship between the movement of matter and the ordering of matter. All matter in the universe is tending toward disorder, however, systems can become ordered (become less entropic) with the input of energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can any order be achieved if the tendency for matter in the universe is toward ever-increasing entropy? How can complex (and highly ordered) organisms exist at all? For that matter, how can there be any ordered states in the universe? The answer is that systems can become ordered as long as they are &quot;open&quot; to the universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think of holding 10 marbles in your hand. Your hand represents a system consisting of 10 marbles. Now, turn your hand over and let gravity (a form of energy from outside the system) act on these marbles; they not only fall out of your hand (converting potential energy into kinetic energy), but they also become relatively disordered. You can reorder these marbles back into your hand, however, it requires the input of energy from outside of the system (i.e., your body as you walk around picking them up). The ordering of the marbles back into your hand is done at the expense of entropy somewhere else in the universe. Keep in mind that life (i.e., each organism) exists as a system that is open to the universe, and ultimately the energy that organisms obtain is used, in a sense, to reverse entropic change. From a thermodynamics standpoint, if you stop eating you will die because there is no input of energy from outside your body (i.e., your system) to reverse the natural tendency of matter to disorder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 4.  The Second Law of Thermodynamics - there is a tendency toward disorder." src="assets/Tutorial21_second_law.jpg" title="Figure 4.  The Second Law of Thermodynamics - there is a tendency toward disorder." /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first and second laws are intimately related, and later you will learn how this relationship can be quantitatively stated. In a general sense, life channels energy thermodynamically (via a complex series of energy transformations) for the purpose of decreasing entropy (creating order). For the majority of life forms on Earth, this energy ultimately comes from the sun. Indeed, all the order you see around you is a direct result of the small fraction of total solar radiation that is absorbed by the our planet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a special relationship between temperature and entropy. The entropic state of a given system is proportional to temperature. At absolute zero (in degrees Kelvin), the entropic state of any system is zero. Although absolute zero has never been achieved (-273 deg Centigrade), the relationship between temperature and entropy is important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="0" src="http://c.gigcount.com/wildfire/IMP/CXNID=2000002.0NXC/bT*xJmx*PTEzMDk1NTAzMzI4NjkmcHQ9MTMwOTU1MDM*MDkxOCZwPTIwNjQyMSZkPWIyMTM1NzYzJmc9MiZvPTk2NjhhNGRlZDA4/NDRmNzlhYTY1ZTI4N2RlOTA2Y2E4Jm9mPTA=.gif" style="visibility:hidden;width:0px;height:0px;" width="0" /&gt;&lt;object height="480" width="640"&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2135763" /&gt;&lt;param name="wmode" value="transparent" /&gt;&lt;embed height="480" src="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2135763" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="640" wmode="transparent"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Free Energy Embodies the First and Second Laws&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Free energy&lt;/strong&gt; (G) is the energy available (or required) to do work in a given system. If a given system releases free energy, then it can do work. Conversely, if it absorbs free energy, then work can be done on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s return to the example of marbles being held in a hand. We will define the system as the person holding the marbles and the marbles themselves. When the marbles are held, they are relatively ordered (they have low entropy) but unstable (simply opening the hand will cause a spontaneous change in the system). The potential energy of the marbles is also relatively high. When the hand is opened, however, several things happen. First, potential energy is converted to kinetic energy. Second, friction is produced and released in the form of heat as the marbles fall through the air. Third, the system becomes disordered as the marbles bounce around (entropy increases). If the person walks around and picks up the marbles, then the thermodynamic state changes again. First, the kinetic energy exerted by the person picking up the marbles is converted to gravitational potential energy as the marbles become elevated above the ground, and second, the marbles become more ordered (less entropic). Importantly, the ordered state can be restored, but energy (in the form of the person picking up the marbles) is required to order matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The change in free energy (delta G) is &lt;strong&gt;endergonic&lt;/strong&gt; if energy enters the system, and &lt;strong&gt;exergonic&lt;/strong&gt; if it leaves the system. Moreover, an exergonic reaction is unstable, has a negative delta G, and is therefore a &lt;strong&gt;spontaneous reaction&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, in this example one can see why energy flow is not 100% efficient; as the marbles fall through the air there is a production of frictional heat (which, in this example, does no useful work and represents waste). All energy transfers have some inefficiencies, which is why reactions do not transduce 100% of the available energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organisms can only live at the expense of free energy (G). The free energy changes (delta G) associated with life&amp;#39;s metabolic energy involve the movement of matter. This free energy comes from a series of metabolic reactions that result in work being done at the molecular level (the movement of electrons, atoms, or molecules). Recall the relationship above, between free energy and stability; a given reaction (a system) that has the potential to do a lot of work (release a lot of free energy) is inherently unstable; it typically has a low relative entropy and tends to change spontaneously to a more stable, disordered state. In fact, the concept of spontaneity actually defines whether free energy is made available to do work (or if work is required).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Free energy is more than a change in entropic state because each given system has a certain amount of total energy. However, not all of this total energy is available to do work. Free energy is a function of the total energy change of a system and the entropic change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The Free Energy Equation&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reaction actually describes a change (delta) from one state to another. The change in free energy is denoted as delta G. If this value is negative, then free energy will leave the system, work can be done, and the reaction will occur spontaneously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enthalpy&lt;/strong&gt; (H) is the total energy in a system. If this value is negative, then some energy (typically heat) will leave the system. If this value is positive, then energy will enter the system (typically heat will be absorbed from outside). An &lt;strong&gt;exothermic&lt;/strong&gt; reaction has a negative delta H and will release heat, whereas an &lt;strong&gt;endothermic&lt;/strong&gt; reaction has a positive delta H and will absorb heat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entropic state of the system is denoted S. If the reaction results in an increase in entropy, then this value is positive. If the reaction decreases in entropy, then this value is negative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Free energy is also dependent on temperature. (Recall the relationship between temperature and entropy) The value &quot;T&quot; is given in degrees Kelvin. (To convert Centigrade to Kelvin, add 273.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The relationship between these terms is expressed by the free energy equation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;delta G = delta H - T(delta S)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This equation reveals that not all of the energy stored in a system is available for work; free energy is less than the total energy of a system. The free energy concept can be used to determine whether a specific process or reaction will occur spontaneously. Reactions that occur spontaneously tend to give off heat (have a negative delta H, or change in heat) and result in the disordering of matter (have a positive delta S). However, reactions that absorb heat (have a positive delta H) can occur if there is a large increase in entropy. The free energy equation takes both of these factors into consideration. Keep in mind, the more negative the value of delta G, the more free energy released by the reaction and the more work that can be done. Conversely, as delta G becomes progressively more positive, the energy required for the reaction to proceed also increases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Free Energy and Metabolic Reactions&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the energy in a system at the start of a reaction is greater than the energy at the end of the reaction, the delta G is negative and the reaction is an exergonic reaction. This means that energy is released and can be used to do work. For example, the reactions involved in breaking down glucose to retrieve energy during cellular respiration are exergonic. Cellular respiration (discussed in Tutorial 22 and Tutorial 23) releases energy that the cell can then use to do work. We can express this reaction as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
	&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;C6H12O6 + 6 O2 ----&gt; 6 CO2 + 6 H2O&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you determined, this reaction has a ?G of -686 kcal/mol. For every 180 gms of glucose (1 mole), 686 kcals become available to do work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, endergonic reactions require an input of energy. Photosynthesis, the process by which plants convert CO2 and H2O into sugars, requires an input of energy from the sun, so it is an endergonic process overall. In other words, photosynthesis can be described as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
	&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;6 CO2 + 6 H2O ----&gt; C6H12O6&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This reaction has a delta G of +686 kcal/mole and requires that work be done. This work is done via energy provided by the sun. Photosynthesis will be discussed in Tutorial 28 and Tutorial 29.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;ATP and Cellular Work&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;How does the cell use energy? The short answer is to do work. A cell does three types of work: &lt;strong&gt;mechanical&lt;/strong&gt; (e.g., contracting muscle cells), &lt;strong&gt;transport&lt;/strong&gt; (e.g., moving substances across the cell membrane), and chemical (e.g., non-spontaneous reactions between molecules; discussed in the next section). A major source of chemical energy for this work is &lt;strong&gt;adenosine triphosphate&lt;/strong&gt; (ATP), which is illustrated in the figure above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 5.  The structure of ATP." src="assets/Tutorial21_ATP.jpg" title="Figure 5.  The structure of ATP." /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;ATP is a 5-carbon sugar (ribose) attached to a nitrogenous base (adenine; recall our discussion of the nucleotides DNA and RNA) and a group of three phosphates. The three phosphates are the triphosphate component of adenosine triphosphate, and they are very unstable. This instability is due to the three negative charges that induce an intramolecular strain in one area of the molecule. Most reactions that involve ATP depend on the hydrolysis of the third phosphate to liberate the potential energy that can be used to do work. In addition to free energy that can do work, ADP (adenosine diphosphate) and inorganic phosphate (PO4; abbreviated P&lt;em&gt;i&lt;/em&gt; or a circled P) are released during hydrolysis. The overall reaction is summarized in the figure above. The amount of energy that is made available to do work during this process is variable (depending on a number of factors, including temperature).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 6.  The hydrolysis of ATP releases energy that cells can use to do cell work." src="assets/Tutorial21_ATP_hydrolysis.jpg" title="Figure 6.  The hydrolysis of ATP releases energy that cells can use to do cell work." /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;How Does ATP Perform Work?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Energy is made available from the hydrolysis of ATP to ADP + Pi. This energy provides energy for endergonic reactions. The many mechanisms that different reactions use to obtain energy from ATP are remarkable. Generally they all involve tapping into high-energy electrons found associated with the terminal phosphate group. The use of an exergonic (energy-releasing) process to drive an endergonic (energy-requiring) process is called &lt;strong&gt;energy coupling&lt;/strong&gt;. There are many ways that this can be done. Examine how energy coupling can be used to allow an energetically unfavorable (&lt;strong&gt;non-spontaneous&lt;/strong&gt;) reaction to take place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 7. Energy coupling drives the conversion of glutamic acid to glutamine." src="assets/Tutorial21_glutamine_formation.jpg" title="Figure 7. Energy coupling drives the conversion of glutamic acid to glutamine." /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glutamine (an amino acid) synthesis is an unfavorable reaction that can be described as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
	&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;Glu + NH3 ----&gt; Glu-NH2&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The delta G for this reaction is + 3.4 kcal/mol, therefore, it is a non-spontaneous reaction. However, this reaction does occur with the help of ATP. This is accomplished by coupling the removal of the terminal phosphate of ATP and the addition of ammonia to glutamic acid. In the first step, glutamic acid becomes an unstable phosphorylated intermediate when ATP is broken down. In the second step, ammonia displaces the phosphate group and glutamine is formed. This figure summarizes how ATP can be coupled to a reaction, such that an unfavorable reaction becomes exergonic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hydrolysis of ATP to ADP and Pi releases energy (-7.3 kcal/mol) in excess of the energy required (+3.4 kcal/mol) for the synthesis of glutamine. Therefore, the overall delta G for the two-step process is -3.9 kcal/mol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This type of energy coupling procedure is extremely important, and it allows many endergonic anabolic reactions to occur in the cell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;A Cautionary Note&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The field of thermodynamics has a novel history. It began in the 19th century when engineers were trying to understand how to make more efficient steam-driven engines. What was discovered in this area of science turned out to have an impact on other disciplines (a phenomenon frequently observed in science). The laws of thermodynamics apply to many situations that involve the interaction of matter and energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps in an effort to reach even greater levels of understanding, attempts have been made to apply the laws of thermodynamics to all situations. My kids once tried to talk me out of cleaning their room by citing the second law; it didn&amp;#39;t work (but they did). There are even some popular books that have attempted to explain human societies using thermodynamics (e.g., all societies tend toward disorder unless energy is provided). These analogies can be attractive and can even be quite entertaining (e.g., search the internet for &quot;Thermodynamics of Hell&quot;). However, many of these efforts are flawed and unfounded. While reading, be watchful about how these laws can, and cannot, be reasonably applied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Summary&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Energy and its relationship with matter were examined in this tutorial. Life exists within the context of the physical rules of the universe. Life does not violate any of these rules; rather, these rules can be used to understand the functioning of life. It is important to understand what energy really is; briefly, it can be defined as that which does, or can, move matter. Matter can be things as small as electrons or as large as whales. Most of this tutorial dealt with movement of matter at the chemical level, but these first principles apply to all levels of organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The breakage and formation of chemical bonds at a subatomic level deals with the movement of electrons. Therefore, it is not surprising that these processes involve energetic considerations. Generally, energy is required to break bonds, but energy is released during bond reformation. In a chemical reaction with two reactants, bonds typically must be broken before new bonds form. For example, when methane combines with oxygen, carbon dioxide and water are formed. In this reaction, more energy is released as the bonds reform than was required to break the original bonds. This energy released is available to do work. You will learn that those chemical reactions in the cell that release energy are an important component of energy transduction and are associated with catabolic reactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some reactions do not release energy. Rather, energy is required in order for these reactions to take place. In fact, anabolic reactions typically require energy (this is why food is required for growth). The chemicals in food are used to supply energy, which are used, in part, to build new biomolecules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to recognize the behavior of energy and matter in the universe. These two quantities are described by the laws of thermodynamics. The first law states that energy cannot be created or destroyed; rather, energy is conserved. The second law deals with matter and states that matter is becoming more disordered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two laws of thermodynamics can be related into a quantity known as free energy. The free energy equation is useful because it predicts whether a given reaction will occur spontaneously or non-spontaneously. If the change in free energy is negative, then the reaction will occur spontaneously. If the change in free energy is positive, then the reaction will be non-spontaneous. Virtually all anabolic reactions have an overall positive free energy, but nonetheless occur with the help of energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a reaction requires energy, where does it come from? It depends on the species. Chemoheterotrophic organisms obtain energy from various high-energy carbon compounds. Photoautotrophic organisms obtain their energy from the sun. Ultimately most chemoheterotrophs depend on photoautotrophs for food, so most life on the planet depends on the sun as an energy source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This concludes the first of three tutorials on energy and metabolism. This tutorial covered the concepts of energy, entropy, and thermodynamics. We also began examining ATP and its energetic relationship within the cell. Next we will begin our discussion of one way that ATP is produced.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

			&lt;/td&gt;
		&lt;/tr&gt;
	&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Introduction and Goals&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first tutorial on energy concluded with us looking at ATP, the molecule that supplies most of the energy for cellular work. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is the end product of &lt;strong&gt;cellular respiration&lt;/strong&gt;, which is a catabolic pathway comprised of a series of steps that convert the chemical energy in glucose into the energy contained in ATP. This tutorial will focus on the breakdown of glucose, but keep in mind that molecules can enter the pathway at various points; therefore, glucose is just one of several sugars that can be broken down during cellular respiration. The available energy in glucose (and other sugars) resides within its electrons. These electrons (along with their energy) are removed and passed to intermediate electron carriers in a step-by-step process. These intermediates (e.g., NADH) and the concept of reduction-oxidation reactions (electron transference) will be addressed in this tutorial. By the end of this tutorial you should be familiar with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The general form of a redox reaction&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Redox and energy&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The role of NAD+ in conveying electrons&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Glycolysis&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Alcohol and lactic acid fermentation, and their exploitation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Redox Reactions&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;The term &lt;strong&gt;&quot;redox&quot;&lt;/strong&gt; is short for the chemical process known as &quot;reduction-oxidation.&quot; It refers to the transfer of electrons that occurs during many chemical reactions. Electron transfer is extremely important to the life of a cell. During cellular respiration, there is a relocation of electrons. This relocation results in the release of energy that is stored in food molecules, and the released energy is used to synthesize ATP. Remember the first law of thermodynamics, which describes the conversion of energy; you can&amp;#39;t &quot;make&quot; energy but it can be moved around. Redox is one way that this is accomplished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 1. Methane combustion." src="assets/Tutorial22_combustion.jpg" title="Figure 1. Methane combustion." /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During many cellular reactions, energy changes are conveyed by electrons (molecules either gain or lose electrons). A molecule that gains an electron is reduced, meaning that there has been a &quot;reduction&quot; in its positive charge. This gain in electrons is termed &lt;strong&gt;reduction&lt;/strong&gt;. A molecule that loses an electron is oxidized, and this loss of electrons is termed &lt;strong&gt;oxidation&lt;/strong&gt;. You can remember this somewhat confusing terminology with the mnemonic &quot;OiL RiG&quot;, where (O)xidized species (L)ose electrons and (R)educed species (G)ain electrons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The general equation of a redox reaction is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Xe- + Y --&gt; X + Ye-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this equation, molecule &quot;X&quot; is oxidized and loses an electron (and energy), whereas molecule &quot;Y&quot; is reduced and gains an electron (and energy).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some molecules have a very high affinity for electrons, therefore, they are more likely to oxidize other molecules. The affinity for electrons is termed &lt;strong&gt;electronegativity&lt;/strong&gt;. The more electronegative a molecule is, the more likely it will become reduced by the addition of electrons in a chemical reaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Importantly, not only do electrons move from one molecule to another during a redox reaction, so does energy. Restated, a molecule that is oxidized loses energy, whereas the molecule that is reduced gains energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Redox and Combustion&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Methane (CH4; also known as natural gas) combustion releases energy, CO2 , and H2O as final products. This occurs in the presence of oxygen (O2; which is highly electronegative) every time one ignites a gas stove in a house supplied with natural gas. (This example was also used in Tutorial 16; Energy and Chemical Bonds)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The figure above illustrates the conversion of methane gas into CO2, H2O, and energy. Note that accompanying the transference of electrons, energy is released and it can do work (the reaction is exergonic). In the process of redox, methane is converted into carbon dioxide (which contains an oxidized form of carbon) and water (which contains a reduced form of oxygen). The electrons that are associated with oxygen in the water molecule have much less energy than they had when associated with carbon in methane; this energy difference is released as heat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While heat is useful for cooking, it is not very useful for biological reactions. During redox reactions that occur within your body, a high proportion of the energy that is released is moved into other forms of chemical energy. However, heat is released as a by-product of these reactions because no reaction is 100% efficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Redox and Cellular Respiration&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oxygen is highly electronegative; it tends to pull electrons toward itself and away from other molecules. Consequently it takes energy to keep electrons away from oxygen. As the electrons move closer to oxygen, they lose energy and the energy that is released can be used to do work. Cellular respiration is actually a series of reactions in which electrons are sequentially moved from glucose (and its catabolic products) to oxygen, or in some cases, to an alternative terminal electron acceptor. In the process, energy is released. Restated, cellular respiration is a series of redox reactions in which energy is gradually made available to do work. The work done is the synthesis (anabolism) of ATP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The general equation for cellular respiration is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C6 H12O6 + 6 O2 --&gt; 6 CO2 + 6 H2O + energy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think of this as a redox process. In this case, glucose is oxidized and oxygen is reduced. Remember, oxygen is highly electronegative (electrons are drawn to it). Ultimately, oxygen is reduced to form water and glucose is oxidized to produce carbon dioxide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although this redox reaction is written as one equation, it really happens in a series of steps. The reason for this should be evident from the previous two questions. That is, a high amount of energy is released from the oxidation of glucose and unless the body controls this oxidation, much of the energy is wasted as heat. Therefore the cell gradually oxidizes glucose in a series of controlled steps, and electrons (and accompanying energy) are gradually released. Restated, in the oxidation of glucose energy is gradually liberated and becomes available to synthesize ATP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;NAD+ and Electron Transport&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	The general equation for cellular respiration is quite simple, however, the overall process actually takes place in several stages in different parts of the cell. For example, hydrogen atoms (and accompanying electrons) are not directly transferred from glucose to oxygen. There are several intermediate steps, with intermediate oxidants (electron carriers). The most prevalent electron carrier is nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide. This electron carrier can exist in its reduced form (NADH) or as an oxidized positive ion (NAD+). NAD+ is free to pick up electrons, whereas NADH has two more electrons and an additional proton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;A molecule of NAD+ or NADH is quite simple, consisting of two nucleotides (adenine, found in RNA and DNA, and nicotinamide) joined together. In the presence of the enzyme &lt;strong&gt;dehydrogenase&lt;/strong&gt; and hydrogen, NAD+ can become reduced to NADH. The structure of the oxidized form is shown on the left side of this figure, and the right side shows that portion of the molecule where reduction occurs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 2. Oxidized and Reduced Forms of Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide." src="assets/Tutorial22_NAD.jpg" title="Figure 2. Oxidized and Reduced Forms of Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide." /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NAD+ functions as an oxidizing agent (electron acceptor) during cellular respiration, picking up electrons from the catabolic products of glucose (along with hydrogen atoms). Each NAD+ molecule can be reduced with two high-energy electrons and one hydrogen atom. Importantly, once the transfer is complete and the reduced NADH has deposited its electrons, the regenerated NAD+ can pick up more electrons and begin again. In other words, NAD+ acts as an energy shuttle. Think of this process in the following way:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
	&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;XH2 + NAD+ --&gt; X + NADH + H+&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this example, &quot;X&quot; is any molecule that gives up an electron and two hydrogens. Note that there is a single proton, H+, which remains unpaired after this transaction. These protons (hydrogen ions) accumulate and are very useful in certain stages of respiration (to be discussed later).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="0" src="http://c.gigcount.com/wildfire/IMP/CXNID=2000002.0NXC/bT*xJmx*PTEzMDk1NTA3MjM2NTgmcHQ9MTMwOTU1MDc5MzYzMSZwPTIwNjQyMSZkPWIyMTM1NzkzJmc9MiZvPTk2NjhhNGRlZDA4/NDRmNzlhYTY1ZTI4N2RlOTA2Y2E4Jm9mPTA=.gif" style="visibility:hidden;width:0px;height:0px;" width="0" /&gt;&lt;object height="480" width="640"&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2135793" /&gt;&lt;param name="wmode" value="transparent" /&gt;&lt;embed height="480" src="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2135793" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="640" wmode="transparent"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;What Do We Know So Far?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are now prepared to discuss the actual steps of cellular respiration. You should know:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;High-energy molecules are unstable and can spontaneously change into low-energy molecules, accompanied by a release of energy that can do work.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Glucose is a highly ordered, high-energy molecule that is broken down (catabolized) in the transduction of cellular energy.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Cellular respiration takes place in a series of steps.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;ATP has three high-energy-containing phosphate groups.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The general equation for cellular respiration (the oxidation of glucose)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;How ATP drives cellular work&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The three types of cellular work&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;What &quot;redox&quot; means&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;How NAD+ functions as an electron carrier&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are comfortable with all of these concepts, it&amp;#39;s time to move on. If not, review those concepts that do not make sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The Stages of Cellular Respiration&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Respiration can be broken down into three metabolic stages:&lt;br /&gt;
	1. Glycolysis&lt;br /&gt;
	2. The Krebs, or Citric Acid cycle&lt;br /&gt;
	3. Electron transport and oxidative phosphorylation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the eukaryotic cell, glycolysis (stage 1) occurs in the &lt;strong&gt;cytosol&lt;/strong&gt; (the protein-rich, semi-fluid part of the cell in which the cell&amp;#39;s organelles are immersed), whereas the Krebs cycle, electron transport, and oxidative phosphorylation (stages 2 and 3) occur in the mitochondria (discussed in Tutorial 23). While our discussion will focus on cellular respiration in the eukaryotic cell, you should note that this process also takes place in prokaryotes (even though they lack mitochondria).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes glycolysis is presented as a process separate from cellular respiration, so don&amp;#39;t be confused if you hear someone mention &quot;glycolysis and cellular respiration.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Glycolysis: The First Step in Cellular Respiration&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Glycolysis&lt;/strong&gt; involves the initial breakdown of glucose to &lt;strong&gt;pyruvate&lt;/strong&gt; (or pyruvic acid), water, and reduced electron carriers (in this case NADH). Ingested carbohydrates are first broken down by your saliva, and then by enzymes in your stomach. Glucose, from your food, is then taken into your cells, and during glycolysis is split into two 3-carbon molecules of pyruvate. Glucose is not the only sugar used by your body; other sugars are either converted to glucose or introduced at other points in the glycolytic pathway. Likewise, fats and proteins can be used as energy sources. These foods are catabolized and the metabolic breakdown products enter the cellular respiratory pathway at various points. We will begin with glucose because it makes use of all the metabolic steps, and hence illustrates the complete process of cellular respiration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glycolysis is initiated by the addition of a phosphate (P), from ATP, to a molecule of glucose; this destabilizes the glucose molecule and the bonds are then easily broken to release energy. So while there is a net gain of ATP in cellular respiration, some ATP is used to start the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 3. Generalized Diagram of Glycolysis." src="assets/Tutorial22_glycolysis.jpg" title="Figure 3. Generalized Diagram of Glycolysis." /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glycolysis is a ten-step process, but all of the specific intermediate molecules and enzymes involved won&amp;#39;t be discussed here. However, you should understand the general way in which ATP is produced during glycolysis. At two steps, a phosphorylated molecule (e.g., the substrate PEP in the figure) transfers a phosphate group to ADP. This &lt;strong&gt;substrate-level phosphorylation&lt;/strong&gt; can only occur in the presence of a specific enzyme (which differs according to the particular substrate that is donating the phosphate).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 4. Glycolysis Energy Assessment." src="assets/Tutorial22_glycolysis_energy.jpg" title="Figure 4. Glycolysis Energy Assessment." /&gt;It takes two molecules of ATP to break down one molecule of glucose to pyruvate. The output is four ATPs and two NADHs. Therefore, there is a net gain of two ATPs and two NADHs from one molecule of glucose from glycolysis alone. Most of the energy remains in the pyruvate molecule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;This figure shows the overall energy &quot;balance sheet&quot; for glycolysis. Note the initial &quot;investment&quot; of energy in the early stages, which requires 2 ATP molecules per molecule of glucose. In the later stages, 4 ATP molecules and 2 NADH molecules are produced, which yields a net production of 2 molecules of pyruvate, 2 molecules of ATP, and 2 molecules of NADH per molecule of glucose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Pyruvate (continued)&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned, one of the products of the initial breakdown of glucose is pyruvate. Pyruvate is further modified and enters the next stages of cellular respiration (the Krebs cycle and the electron transport chain). It is at these stages that most of the ATP is produced for cellular work. Probably because of its connection to the production of chemical energy, pyruvate has become a very popular nutritional supplement among dieters and body builders. The merits of pyruvate are greatly disputed. For general interest, you may want to do a Google search for &quot;Pyruvate&quot; for interesting comparisons of popular claims to actual research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="0" src="http://c.gigcount.com/wildfire/IMP/CXNID=2000002.0NXC/bT*xJmx*PTEzMDk1NTA4Mjc5NDMmcHQ9MTMwOTU1MDgzNDA3MSZwPTIwNjQyMSZkPWIyMTM1ODAxJmc9MiZvPTk2NjhhNGRlZDA4/NDRmNzlhYTY1ZTI4N2RlOTA2Y2E4Jm9mPTA=.gif" style="visibility:hidden;width:0px;height:0px;" width="0" /&gt;&lt;object height="480" width="640"&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2135801" /&gt;&lt;param name="wmode" value="transparent" /&gt;&lt;embed height="480" src="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2135801" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="640" wmode="transparent"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Fermentation&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glycolysis generates ATP without using oxygen as an electron acceptor. Restated, glycolysis can occur whether oxygen is present or not and whether conditions are aerobic or anaerobic. Pyruvate has two general fates: it can be further oxidized (in which case, more energy is obtained) or it can be further reduced (and discarded as waste).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process by which glucose is partially broken down and NAD+ is regenerated is &lt;strong&gt;fermentation&lt;/strong&gt;. The many types of fermentation differ in the waste products that are formed when pyruvate is broken down. Fermentation can occur in the presence or absence of oxygen. Many bacteria only carry out fermentation in the absence of oxygen, whereas yeast will ferment in the presence or absence of oxygen. &lt;img alt="Figure 5. Two Common Types of Fermentation." src="assets/Tutorial22_fermentation.jpg" title="Figure 5. Two Common Types of Fermentation.   Lactic acid fermentation is used to make cheese and yogurt. Alcohol fermentation is used to make beer and wine." /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two common types of fermentation are &lt;strong&gt;alcohol fermentation&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;lactic acid fermentation&lt;/strong&gt;. In alcohol fermentation, pyruvate gives off carbon dioxide and is converted to ethyl alcohol (ethanol) in a two-step process. In lactic acid fermentation, pyruvate is converted to lactate (lactic acid). The figure below depicts both types.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lactic acid fermentation is used to make cheese and yogurt. Alcohol fermentation is used to make beer and wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;Humans capitalize on both of these fermentation processes. Yeast undergo alcohol fermentation in the production of beer and wine. Certain bacteria and fungi undergo lactic acid fermentation, and are used to make cheese and yogurt (discussed in Tutorial 20). There are many facultative anaerobes that can switch between fermentation and complete cellular respiration, depending on their environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Summary&lt;/h1&gt;

			&lt;/td&gt;
		&lt;/tr&gt;
	&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Introduction and Goals&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The previous tutorial concentrated on the first stages of cellular respiration (i.e., glycolysis). You should know that glycolysis produces pyruvate and some ATP. The pyruvate can be used in fermentation, but it can also be used in another manner. There are many high-energy electrons left in pyruvate. Next, you will learn how cells complete cellular respiration by oxidizing pyruvate to form carbon dioxide. You will also learn that these electrons are conveyed to an electron transport chain where they can participate in the synthesis of ATP. By the end of this tutorial you should have a basic understanding of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The Krebs cycle&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The electron transport chain&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Chemiosmosis&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The energy balance of cellular respiration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The Krebs Cycle&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recall, glycolysis results in a net gain of 2 ATP and 2 NADH molecules from one molecule of glucose. Keep in mind, this gain represents an effective transfer of 20 kcal of energy to ATP (about 10 kcal each) and about 80 kcal of energy to NADH (about 40 kcal each), for a total of about 100 kcal. The complete oxidation of glucose results in the release of 684 kcal of energy, therefore, there is a good amount of energy still remaining in pyruvate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 1.  The Krebs Cycle." src="assets/Tutorial23_Krebs_cycle.jpg" title="Figure 1.  The Krebs Cycle." /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In eukaryotes, pyruvate is transported across the mitochondrial membrane and then converted to acetyl CoA (with the production of NADH and carbon dioxide). Acetyl CoA is then oxidized by a series of enzymes that make up a cyclical series of reactions known as the Krebs cycle (some textbooks refer to this as the citric acid cycle). During the &lt;strong&gt;Krebs cycle&lt;/strong&gt;, electrons are removed from acetyl CoA and these electrons reduce more NAD+, along with another electron carrier, &lt;strong&gt;FAD&lt;/strong&gt;. The ATP that is produced is generated via substrate-level phosphorylation, just as it was in glycolysis. Each NADH and FADH2 molecule that is formed is an important source of energy that will be used to generate ATP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;img alt="Figure 2.  An overview of the Krebs Cycle." src="assets/Tutorial23_Krebs_overview.jpg" title="Figure 2.  An overview of the Krebs Cycle." /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While you will not be required to memorize all of the intermediates (e.g., isocitrate, fumarate, etc.) and enzymes involved in the Krebs cycle, this figure demonstrates the overall reactions that result in the complete oxidation of acetyl CoA. You can also see where carbon dioxide is released as a by-product and where electron carriers are reduced to form NADH and FADH2. Also note that the ATP formed results from the direct transfer of a phosphate from a substrate (substrate-level phosphorylation).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;This figure provides a good summary of the Krebs cycle, illustrating the main reactants (acetyl CoA, NAD+, FAD, ADP, and inorganic phosphate) and products (carbon dioxide, NADH, FADH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and ATP) from what is actually a multistep process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The Role of NADH and FADH2&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glucose catabolism ends during the Krebs cycle. This does not mean that all of the energy previously contained in glucose was used in the production of ATP. In fact, only one additional ATP molecule (per molecule of pyruvate) is produced by substrate-level phosphorylation in the Krebs cycle. The balance of extracted energy is tied up in NADH and FADH2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the next phase of cellular respiration, the high-energy electrons within NADH and FADH2 will be passed to a set of membrane-bound enzymes in the &lt;strong&gt;mitochondrion&lt;/strong&gt;, collectively referred to as the &lt;strong&gt;electron transport chain&lt;/strong&gt;. These electrons will provide energy to do work. Specifically, this work will involve the movement of positively charged hydrogen atoms (H+), also known as &lt;strong&gt;protons&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The movement of protons across the inner mitrochondrial membrane (by the electron transport chain) creates a &lt;strong&gt;charge differential (voltage)&lt;/strong&gt; that will be used to synthesize ATP. Mitochondrion structure and the origin of mitochondria will be discussed in more detail in Tutorial 24.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="0" src="http://c.gigcount.com/wildfire/IMP/CXNID=2000002.0NXC/bT*xJmx*PTEzMDk1NTEyMzYxOTQmcHQ9MTMwOTU1MjczMzMxMiZwPTIwNjQyMSZkPWIyMTM1ODg5Jmc9MiZvPTk2NjhhNGRlZDA4/NDRmNzlhYTY1ZTI4N2RlOTA2Y2E4Jm9mPTA=.gif" style="visibility:hidden;width:0px;height:0px;" width="0" /&gt;&lt;object height="480" width="640"&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2135889" /&gt;&lt;param name="wmode" value="transparent" /&gt;&lt;embed height="480" src="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2135889" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="640" wmode="transparent"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The Electron Transport Chain&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NADH and FADH2 convey their electrons to the electron transport chain. This transport chain is composed of a number of molecules (mostly proteins) that are located in the inner membrane of the mitochondrion. Each membrane protein has a particular electronegativity (affinity for electrons). The more electronegative the molecule, the more energy required to keep the electron away from it. In this way, a slightly electronegative membrane protein will pull electrons away from reduced electron carriers. In the presence of an even-more electronegative molecule, these electrons will be oxidized from the first membrane protein, and so on. Finally the electrons reduce oxygen, and along with the addition of hydrogen ions, water is produced as a waste product. This stepwise movement, whereby an electron from one protein is transferred to another in the chain, is also reflective of the overall decrease in the amount of energy that the electron possesses. Importantly, each step has a negative delta G. Therefore with each oxidation/reduction reaction, energy is made available to do work. This work involves the movement of protons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 3. The Electron Transport Chain and Free Energy Change." src="assets/Tutorial23_redox.jpg" style="width: 435px; height: 500px;" title="Figure 3. The Electron Transport Chain and Free Energy Change." /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;Oxygen is one of the most electronegative atoms. This is important because the relative change in electronegativity determines how much energy is available to do work. When oxygen acts as the &lt;strong&gt;terminal electron acceptor&lt;/strong&gt;, there is a maximal amount of free energy released; hence, more protons can be transported, which means that a greater charge buildup occurs across the inner mitochondria membrane. This figure illustrates the energetic relationship between various members of the electron transport chain when oxygen serves as the electron acceptor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Chemiosmosis&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the movement of electrons through the electron transport chain, protons accumulate on the inside of the inner mitochondrial membrane. As electrons move from one member of the electron transport chain to the next, protons are transported from one side of the membrane to the other, resulting in a buildup of protons in the intermembrane space. This creates a charge differential (voltage) across the inner membrane; it is this stored energy that is actually used to synthesize ATP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 4. An Overview of Electron Transport and Oxidative Phosphorylation." src="assets/Tutorial23_electron_transport.jpg" title="Figure 4. An Overview of Electron Transport and Oxidative Phosphorylation." /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As these excess protons from the intermembrane space flow back into the &lt;strong&gt;mitochondrial matrix&lt;/strong&gt; (the part of the mitochondrion enclosed within the inner membrane, which houses the enzymes and substrates for the Krebs cycle), ADP is phosphorylated to make ATP (&lt;strong&gt;chemiosmosis&lt;/strong&gt;). Chemiosmosis is accomplished in the presence of the protein complex &lt;strong&gt;ATP synthase&lt;/strong&gt;, which is also located in the inner mitochondrial membrane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note how the transfer of electrons provides the energy to move protons across the inner mitochondrial membrane. This buildup of protons in the intermembrane space creates a charge differential (voltage), and this stored energy is then used to drive the ATP synthase complex to affect the production of ATP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Oxidative Phosphorylation and ATP Yield&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recall, substrate-level phosphorylation was introduced in Tutorial 22. The generation of ATP from chemiosmosis is referred to as &lt;strong&gt;oxidative phosphorylation&lt;/strong&gt; because oxygen&amp;#39;s oxidative property allows a large amount of free energy to be made available for ATP synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 5. An Overview of Cellular Respiration." src="assets/Tutorial23_respiration_overview.jpg" title="Figure 5. An Overview of Cellular Respiration." /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;This figure emphasizes several important concepts about cellular respiration. First, note the locations of glycolysis, the Krebs cycle, and the electron transport chain and oxidative phosphorylation. Second, note how the electron carriers transport electrons to the transport chain, and the net amount of ATP generated at each step. In particular, compare the amount of ATP generated by oxidative phosphorylation to the amount generated by substrate-level phosphorylation. The maximum net yield of 38 ATPs per molecule of glucose is merely an estimate. Much of the energy bound in a molecule of glucose is actually lost as heat during metabolism. While this heat is actually a waste product, homeotherms (&quot;warm-blooded&quot; animals) capitalize on this waste and use it to maintain constant body temperatures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="0" src="http://c.gigcount.com/wildfire/IMP/CXNID=2000002.0NXC/bT*xJmx*PTEzMDk1NTI3OTA2OTMmcHQ9MTMwOTU1Mjc5MzE2NSZwPTIwNjQyMSZkPWIyMTM1ODkzJmc9MiZvPTk2NjhhNGRlZDA4/NDRmNzlhYTY1ZTI4N2RlOTA2Y2E4Jm9mPTA=.gif" style="visibility:hidden;width:0px;height:0px;" width="0" /&gt;&lt;object height="480" width="640"&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2135893" /&gt;&lt;param name="wmode" value="transparent" /&gt;&lt;embed height="480" src="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2135893" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="640" wmode="transparent"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Summary&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tutorial focused on the final steps of cellular respiration. Recall that at the end of glycolysis there is a net production of two molecules of ATP and two molecules of NADH. The ATP is produced via substrate-level phosphorylation; in this reaction, a phosphate group on an organic molecule is transferred directly (along with high-energy electrons) onto a molecule of ADP. Substrate-level phosphorylation also occurs once during the Krebs cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those organisms that completely oxidize glucose, the end product of glycolysis (pyruvate) is further oxidized by enzymes associated with the Krebs cycle (also known as the citric acid cycle and the tricarboxylic acid cycle or TCA cycle). In eukaryotes, the enzymes associated with the Krebs cycle are found in the mitochondria. Pyruvate moves into the mitochondria via specific carrier proteins located in the mitochondrial membranes (in prokaryotes, the Krebs cycle enzymes typically are not compartmentalized but are located in the same compartment as the glycolytic enzymes). Pyruvate is converted to acetyl CoA (accompanied by the evolution of CO2 and one molecule of NADH). The acetyl CoA then enters the Krebs cycle. Within the cell, the Krebs cycle organic acids are not arranged in a circle nor is there any circular arrangement of the enzymes. This pathway is termed a &quot;cycle&quot; (and diagrammed as a circle) because the end product becomes the first product after reacting with acetyl CoA. Acetyl CoA is not the only way that reduced carbon can enter the Krebs cycle. For example, the degradation products of some amino acids enter the Krebs cycle as organic acids (e.g., phenylalanine is converted to fumarate).&lt;br /&gt;
	For every molecule of acetyl CoA that enters the cycle, there is a net gain of three molecules of NADH, one molecule of FADH2 (a chemical relative of NADH), and one molecule of ATP (the ATP is produced via substrate-level phosphorylation). Two molecules of CO2 are produced as a by-product. As with glycolysis, there is only a marginal gain of ATP; the majority of energy is tied up in the NADH and FADH2 molecules. How is this energy liberated? To answer this we need to consider the work that is done by NADH and FADH2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The high-energy carriers NADH and FADH2 can themselves be oxidized by the electron transport chain. During oxidation, energy is lost by the oxidized molecule while energy is gained by the reduced molecule. The electron transport chain is composed of a series of molecules that alternatively become oxidized and reduced by one another. As these redox reactions occur, free energy is made available to do work, and that work is the movement of charged hydrogen atoms (protons) across a membrane. The electron transport chain is mostly contained within the membrane, and energetically, the electrons that pass from one molecule to the next have decreasing potential energies. The last molecule that is reduced is oxygen, which results in the generation of water. Some bacteria can use other molecules (e.g., nitrate, sulfate, or organic acids) as terminal electron acceptors, and hence can undergo cellular respiration under anaerobic conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how is ATP produced? During the movement of electrons down the electron transport chain, protons accumulate on the other side of the inner mitochondrial membrane; mitochondria have a double membrane. The accumulation of charged ions, separated by a nonconductive membrane, creates a voltage. In other words, the mitochondrion can be thought of as a battery that is charged by the electron transport chain. Also existing within the inner membrane is a complex known as the ATP synthase complex. This complex acts as a channel in which protons flow back into the mitochondrion. As these protons move back into the mitochondria, free energy is released as the charge differential decreases; the resulting energy is used to synthesize ATP. In other words, the electron transport chain charges the battery, and the ATP synthase discharges it and uses the energy to produce ATP.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

&lt;h2&gt;Introduction and Goals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tutorial will introduce protists, which are relatively simple eukaryotic organisms. The taxonomy of this group is currently under extensive revision, therefore, no two textbooks present the same taxonomic scheme. Indeed, the emerging science of comparative genomics is almost daily revising the structure of the tree of life. For more on this emerging field, read this Discover Magazine blog post entitled &quot;&lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/2008/07/17/festooning-the-tree-of-life/" target="_blank"&gt;Festooning the Tree of Life&lt;/a&gt;.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 1.  Giardia lamblia, a protistan intestinal parasite." src="assets/Tutorial27_fig1giardia1%20copy.jpg" title="Figure 1.  Giardia lamblia, a protistan intestinal parasite." /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This course will present a scheme that uses three domains (domains Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukarya). Recall, the non-mitochondrial/chloroplast DNA in a eukaryotic cell is located within the nucleus, which is surrounded by the nuclear envelope. Eukaryotic cells also possess extensive systems of intracellular membranes that provide elaborate internal compartmentalization. Additionally, they generally have organelles (e.g., mitochondria and, in some cases, chloroplasts). In contrast, prokaryotic DNA is concentrated in the nucleoid region, which is analogous to the eukaryotic nucleus, but is not membrane-bound (discussed in &lt;a href="https://online.science.psu.edu/biol110_sandbox_2381/node/8964"&gt;Prokaryotes I: Cellular and Genetic Organization&lt;/a&gt;). Prokaryotes do not have mitochondria or chloroplasts, and they generally possess internal membrane systems that are far less complex than those found in the eukaryotes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tutorial contains a number of links that have been included for your interest. The material in these Web sites need not be memorized unless the material is covered directly in the text of the tutorial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the end of this tutorial you should have a working knowledge of the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The meaning of the terms paraphyletic, polyphyletic, and monophyletic&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Different groups of protists including the protists with modified mitochondria and Kingdoms Euglenozoa and Alveolata&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The role of protists in various mammalian diseases (e.g., giardiasis, trypanosomiasis, and malaria)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Dinoflagellates and their ecological roles in various habitats (e.g., coral reefs and red tides)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Protists&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protists are, for the most part, single-celled organisms. Like other eukaryotes, they have membrane-bound nuclei and organelles. Protists are relatively simple organisms, only because most are unicellular. However, a closer inspection reveals that they really are surprisingly sophisticated. All of the essential metabolic functions that occur in multicellular organisms (e.g., respiration, photosynthesis, digestion, and excretion) also occur in protists. Moreover, they can show sophisticated locomotion. The ubiquitous Euglena, found in most freshwater ponds, illustrates such protistan sophistication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 2.  The golden alga, Mallomonas sp." src="assets/Tutorial27_fig2golden_alga.jpg" title="Figure 2.  The golden alga, Mallomonas sp." /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Euglena&lt;/em&gt; possess (within a single cell): a flagellum for locomotion; an eyespot and light detector which, when used in concert, allows them to discern the direction of the most intense light; chloroplasts and mitochondria; granules of the polysaccharide paramylum for storage of surplus carbohydrates from photosynthesis; a contractile vacuole for osmoregulation; a nucleus; and an extensive endomembrane system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 3.  A drawing of a Euglena." src="assets/Tutorial27_fig3euglena.jpg" title="Figure 3.  A drawing of a Euglena." /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protists are a metabolically and ecologically diverse group. Metabolically, they range from photosynthetic autotrophic species to heterotrophic species. They occupy diverse ecological habitats ranging from marine, to freshwater, to terrestrial. They have diverse relationships with other organisms, and are found free-living or as members of various symbioses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all of this diversity, protistan taxonomy is uncertain and the field is currently undergoing major changes. Some of these changes are confusing and reflect the uncertainty of how to best classify these organisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 4. The Three-Domain System for Classifying Life." src="assets/Tutorial27_fig4three_domain.jpg" title="Figure 4. The Three-Domain System for Classifying Life." /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;Many scientists still place all protists together into one kingdom, Protista. Although there are arguments for this classification scheme, in this course we will use the three-domain system. This newer system accommodates the great diversity of protists and recognizes many kingdoms within this group. Scientists working with protists generally agree that these organisms, as a group, are &lt;strong&gt;polyphyletic&lt;/strong&gt;. That is, based on genetic sequence analyses and investigation of cellular components, protists arose from several distinct ancestors; therefore, they should not be placed in a single kingdom. For the sake of convenience we will use the term &quot;protist,&quot; but keep in mind that this is not a taxonomic term; rather, protist describes a diverse group of mostly single-celled eukaryotes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 5.  A diplomonad." src="assets/Tutorial27_fig5diplomonad.jpg" title="Figure 5.  A diplomonad." /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this tutorial, you will learn about two of the five kingdoms that have been best characterized: Euglenozoa and Alveolata.&amp;nbsp; You will also learn about the protists with modified mitochondria and the slime molds which have not yet been classified.&amp;nbsp; In &lt;a href="https://online.science.psu.edu/biol110_sandbox_2381/node/8930"&gt;Protists II: Kingdoms Stramenopila, Rhodophyta, and Chlorophyta&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://online.science.psu.edu/biol110_sandbox_2381/node/8930"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/a&gt;two more kingdoms will be examined: Stramenopila and Chlorophyta. There are many protists that do not fit into these kingdoms, and many more kingdoms are emerging as work on these groups progresses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 6.  A Parabasalid: Trichomonas vaginalis." src="assets/Tutorial27_fig6trichomonad.jpg" title="Figure 6.  A Parabasalid: Trichomonas vaginalis." /&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Protists with Modified Mitochondria&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two groups of protists (the &lt;strong&gt;diplomonads&lt;/strong&gt; and the &lt;strong&gt;parabasalids&lt;/strong&gt;) have highly modified mitochondria. The evidence suggests that each group is monophyletic but what is less clear is how closely related these two groups are to each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Diplomonads&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The diplomonads have modified mitochondria that lack functional electron transport chains and thus are unable to perform cellular respiration and thus get their energy from pathways such as glycolysis. These organisms are found in anaerobic environments and are often parasites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 7.  Giardia intestinalis in culture." src="assets/Tutorial27_fig7giardia2.jpg" title="Figure 7.  Giardia intestinalis in culture.  In these preparations, the flagella (four pairs per cell) are clearly visible." /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The diplomonad &lt;a href="http://www.dpd.cdc.gov/dpdx/HTML/ImageLibrary/Giardiasis_il.htm" target="_blank"&gt;Giardia&lt;/a&gt;, is an intestinal parasite responsible for the disease &lt;a href="http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dpd/parasites/giardiasis/factsht_giardia.htm" target="_blank"&gt;giardiasis&lt;/a&gt; or &quot;beaver fever,&quot; which is generally transmitted via contaminated drinking water. Giardia attaches to the intestinal epithelium, or lining, in humans and other mammals (e.g., dogs, cats, bears, and beavers), creating severe diarrhea and intestinal cramps. Unlike bacterial infections, in which a large number of organisms must be ingested to cause illness, a few Giardia individuals can cause a severe case of giardiasis. The parasite is endemic to many wilderness areas; infection can be prevented by treating the water either with a biofilter or with chemicals such as bleach. While it is a decidedly unpleasant disease to have, giardiasis is fairly easily treated with drugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 8. Cysts of Giardia intestinalis from a human patient." src="assets/Tutorial27_fig8giardia_cyst.jpg" title="Figure 8. Cysts of Giardia intestinalis from a human patient.  Note that each Giardia cell has two nuclei, as do all diplomonads." /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Parabasalids&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The parabasalids are anaerobes that lack functional mitochondria but some species contain a structure known as a hydrogenosome that may be a degenerate mitochondrion. Perhaps the best known parabasalids are in the genus Trychomonas (for example, T. vaginalis (Figure 6) is a sexually transmitted parasite that infects millions of people a year) and are parasites of animals. However, another important group of parabasalids are endosymbionts of insects and live in these animals&amp;#39; guts. For example, members of the genus Trychonympha are important symbionts in termite guts; the Trychonympha contain endosymbiotic bacteria that help them break down cellulose in the termite gut. This allows termites to consume wood (which can be a problem if they choose to eat your wood house).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 9. A Trychonympha sp. that lives in the guts of termites" src="assets/Tutorial27_fig9Trichonympha1.jpg" title="Figure 9. A Trychonympha sp. that lives in the guts of termites" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Kingdom Euglenozoa&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the &lt;strong&gt;euglenozoans&lt;/strong&gt; are &lt;strong&gt;monophyletic&lt;/strong&gt; (derived from a single ancestor), they are a diverse group in terms of their feeding strategies. Kingdom &lt;strong&gt;Euglenozoa&lt;/strong&gt; includes heterotrophs, such as &lt;em&gt;Trypanosoma&lt;/em&gt;, and autotrophs, such as &lt;em&gt;Euglena&lt;/em&gt; (shown here). This kingdom can be divided into two groups. The first consists of &lt;em&gt;Euglena&lt;/em&gt; and its relatives, collectively called the &lt;strong&gt;euglenoids&lt;/strong&gt;. These organisms are primarily photosynthetic. All euglenoids have flagella (structurally different from those of prokaryotes) and all store surplus carbohydrates from photosynthesis as &lt;strong&gt;paramylum&lt;/strong&gt;. Click here to see movies of &lt;em&gt;Euglena&lt;/em&gt; at the Website called &quot;&lt;a href="http://micro.magnet.fsu.edu/moviegallery/pondscum/protozoa/euglena/rostrifera/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Molecular Expressions&lt;/a&gt;.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 10. A Euglena sp." src="assets/Tutorial27_fig10euglena2.jpg" title="Figure 10. A Euglena sp." /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second group of euglenozoans is the &lt;strong&gt;kinetoplastids&lt;/strong&gt;, which includes &lt;em&gt;Trypanosoma&lt;/em&gt; and its relatives, all of whom have one large mitochondrion and an organelle called a &lt;strong&gt;kinetoplast&lt;/strong&gt;, which stores extranuclear DNA. All kinetoplastids live in symbiosis with host organisms, and a number of them are pathogenic. For example, the disease African trypanosomiasis, or African sleeping sickness, is caused by euglenozoans from the genus &lt;em&gt;Trypanosoma&lt;/em&gt;. African &lt;em&gt;Trypanosoma&lt;/em&gt; species are transmitted between mammalian hosts by the tsetse fly, a biting insect that transfers the parasite from the blood of infected individuals to the blood of uninfected hosts. The symptoms of &lt;a href="http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dpd/parasites/trypanosomiasis/default.htm" target="_blank"&gt;African sleeping sickness&lt;/a&gt; include fatigue and confusion, which results after &lt;em&gt;Trypanosoma&lt;/em&gt; invades the central nervous system. This disease, although fatal if left unchecked, can be treated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 11.  Trypanosoma brucei (blue) and red blood cells (gray) of an individual infected with African sleeping sickness." src="assets/Tutorial27_fig11trypanosoma.jpg" title="Figure 11.  Trypanosoma brucei (blue) and red blood cells (gray) of an individual infected with African sleeping sickness." /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;Another parasite from this same genus causes &lt;a href="http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dpd/parasites/chagasdisease/default.htm" target="_blank"&gt;Chagas disease&lt;/a&gt;, or American trypanosomiasis, which is transmitted by insects known as &quot;kissing bugs.&quot; Chagas disease, which occurs primarily in rural areas of Central and South America, affects between 8 and 11 million people and kills nearly 40,000 every year. It tends to be a chronic infection that causes acute symptoms (e.g., gastrointestinal discomfort and heart enlargement or other cardiac problems) between 10 and 20 years after infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 12. Trypanosoma cruzi (purple) among human red blood cells (beige)." src="assets/Tutorial27_fig12chagas.jpg" title="Figure 12. Trypanosoma cruzi (purple) among human red blood cells (beige).  Trypanosoma cruzi is responsible for Chagas disease." /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is some speculation that the debilitating fatigue and gastrointestinal distress that plagued Charles Darwin for the better part of his life after his return to England from South America was actually due to a chronic infection of Chagas disease.&lt;br /&gt;
	Preventive measures for both African sleeping sickness and Chagas disease are largely focused on vector control, which ranges from insecticide-treated bednets (ITNs) to the &quot;&lt;a href="http://judson.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/09/09/a-genetically-engineered-swat/" target="_blank"&gt;sterile insect technique,&lt;/a&gt;&quot; which is a controlled release of sterilized male insects into the vector population in an effort to reduce total fertility rate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Introduction to Kingdom Alveolata&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The kingdom &lt;strong&gt;Alveolata&lt;/strong&gt; is another diverse group. It includes some of the most familiar and ecologically interesting protists in existence, including those that build coral reefs, the organism that causes malaria, and the algae that poison fish during red tide events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 13. A dinoflagellate. Peridinium sp." src="assets/Tutorial27_fig13dinoflagellate.jpg" title="Figure 13. A dinoflagellate. Peridinium sp." /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This group is monophyletic and recognizable by their &lt;strong&gt;alveoli&lt;/strong&gt; (small cavities enclosed in membranes that hug the internal cell surface). There are three distinct groups of &lt;strong&gt;alveolates&lt;/strong&gt;: dinoflagellates, apicomplexans, and ciliates.&amp;nbsp; The remainder of this tutorial will concentrate on the dinoflagellates and apicomplexans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 14.  An apicomplexan.  Plasmodium falciparum." src="assets/Tutorial27_fig14apicomplexan.jpg" title="Figure 14.  An apicomplexan.  Plasmodium falciparum." /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Kingdom Alveolata: Dinoflagellates&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dinoflagellates&lt;/strong&gt; typically possess distinct shapes due to &quot;frames&quot; of cellulose within their cell walls. Their cell surface is generally ridged with perpendicular grooves that house a pair of flagella (shown right). These flagella, the defining characteristic of this group, beat within their grooves and cause dinoflagellates to rotate as they move forward. The word dinoflagellate is derived from the Greek word &lt;em&gt;dinos&lt;/em&gt;, which means &quot;rotation&quot; or &quot;whirling,&quot; and the Latin flagellum, which means &quot;whip.&quot; Many dinoflagellates are photosynthetic; accordingly, they comprise a significant proportion of the &lt;strong&gt;phytoplankton&lt;/strong&gt; that floats near the surface of the ocean, making them a critical component of the food web. Phytoplankton are an essential food resource for many other organisms, ranging from heterotrophic protists to baleen whales and many other organisms in between (most of whom serve as food themselves for creatures at higher trophic levels).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 15. A ciliate.  Stentor sp." src="assets/Tutorial27_fig15cilliate.jpg" title="Figure 15. A ciliate.  Stentor sp." /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not all dinoflagellates are photosynthetic; many are heterotrophic. Some of these heterotrophs exploit chloroplasts from photosynthetic protists, becoming autotrophic themselves for a time. Some dinoflagellates live in symbiosis with different species, as parasites in some cases and as mutualists in others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 16.  A dinoflagellate." src="assets/Tutorial27_fig16dinoflagellate2.jpg" title="Figure 16.  A dinoflagellate." /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some dinoflagellates, such as those in the genus &lt;em&gt;Noctiluca&lt;/em&gt;, have the ability to &lt;strong&gt;bioluminesce&lt;/strong&gt; (make their own light). This is accomplished with the compound luciferin, which is the same chemical that makes fireflies glow. &lt;em&gt;Noctiluca&lt;/em&gt; floats just under the surface of the ocean, and when individuals number in the millions they can produce spectacular glowing tides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 17.  A dinoflagellate.  Noctiluca scintillans is one dinoflagellate responsible for red tides." src="assets/Tutorial27_fig17dinoflagellate3.jpg" title="Figure 17.  A dinoflagellate.  Noctiluca scintillans is one dinoflagellate responsible for red tides." /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The red border at the advancing wave front (tide line) as it washes onto the beach is a real visible glow that is triggered by the tumbling dinoflagellates as they hit the sand. If you walk along the tide line of such a beach, your footprints actually glow with each step when your foot disturbs these bioluminescent protists. How bioluminescence evolved is not completely understood. The Burglar Alarm theory posits that the bioluminescent glow attracts predators of dinoflagellate predators and this allows the glowing protist to escape predation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 18.  A bioluminescent algal bloom." src="assets/Tutorial27_fig18bioluminescence.jpg" title="Figure 18.  A bioluminescent algal bloom." /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dinoflagellates and Coral Reefs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the mutualistic associations formed by dinoflagellates is their symbiotic relationship with reef-building cnidarians, animals in the same phylum as sea anemones and jellyfish. Corals engulf dinoflagellates but do not digest them; rather, these dinoflagellates, called &lt;strong&gt;zooxanthellae&lt;/strong&gt;, live out their lives within the tissues of corals. What does each of the partners in this mutualistic symbiosis have to gain? Corals provide dinoflagellates with a relatively safe refuge from predators and fluctuating environmental conditions. In return, photosynthetic dinoflagellates provide the chief source of food (photosynthate or fixed carbon) for coral-building cnidarians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 19.  Individual cnidarian polyps (coral-building organisms)." src="assets/Tutorial27_fig19coral.jpg" title="Figure 19.  Individual cnidarian polyps (coral-building organisms)." /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coral reefs are actually composed of the &lt;strong&gt;exoskeletons&lt;/strong&gt; (secreted calcium carbonate shells) from countless generations of organisms, each of which anchored itself onto the remains of the previous generation, secreting more calcium carbonate and building up the reef incrementally over time.&lt;br /&gt;
	While some corals are capable of existing without symbiotic protists, they do not thrive and the rate of calcium carbonate deposition (reef-building) is far slower when dinoflagellates are absent. As tiny as dinoflagellates are, they cooperate to build reefs that are thousands of miles long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, reefs are complex vital ecosystems that support many life forms that simply would not exist if reefs disappeared; therefore, a great many organisms are indirectly dependent on the activity of dinoflagellates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently many reefs have begun to suffer, becoming dramatically bleached in appearance as corals die or lose their zooxanthellae. There have been a number of hypotheses advanced to explain this phenomenon (e.g., pollution, an increase in ultraviolet light due to the widening hole in the ozone, and global temperature changes), and all of these factors can be traced back to the impact of humans on the environment. Others suggest that natural weather fluctuations or disease outbreaks may be responsible. Whatever the ultimate cause, loss of symbiotic dinoflagellates appears to be the immediate source for the bleaching. For more information on coral bleaching check out the &lt;a href="http://www.coralreef.noaa.gov/" target="_blank"&gt;NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration)&lt;/a&gt; Coral Reef Site, the &lt;a href="http://www.aims.gov.au/reef-monitoring/" target="_blank"&gt;Australian Institute of Marine Science&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="http://coralreefwatch.noaa.gov/" target="_blank"&gt;NOAA Coral Reef Watch Site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dinoflagellates and Red Tide&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dinoflagellates are the organisms responsible for red tide events, or &quot;harmful algal blooms&quot; (HABs). Blooms (population explosions) of dinoflagellates are sometimes called &quot;red tides&quot; because dinoflagellates can reach such high densities that they actually change the color of the water in which they reside. Depending on the pigments present in these dinoflagellates, these tides actually appear brown, red, orange, or yellow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 20. A red tide in Hong Kong." src="assets/Tutorial27_fig20red_tide.jpg" title="Figure 20. A red tide in Hong Kong." /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A number of dinoflagellate species release toxins into the water, killing many aquatic animals during major algal blooms and poisoning others with sublethal doses of toxins. The primary function of these compounds is probably defensive, warding off or poisoning grazers, and perhaps preventing competing algal species from gaining a foothold in monospecific mats of &lt;strong&gt;plankton&lt;/strong&gt; (minute animal and plant life in the ocean).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 21.  Alexandrium sp.  A red tide organism." src="assets/Tutorial27_fig21alexandrium.jpg" title="Figure 21.  Alexandrium sp.  A red tide organism." /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A recent study suggests that these toxins, known as brevetoxins, can be aerosolized during HAB events, increasing the incidence of respiratory infections among inland populations by 54%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, filter feeders (e.g., shellfish) are particularly vulnerable to brevetoxins because they actively ingest plankton. In turn, heterotrophs (e.g., humans) that eat poisoned animals are often themselves unintended victims of the dinoflagellates&amp;#39; defensive chemicals, contracting such conditions as &lt;a href="http://vm.cfsan.fda.gov/%7Emow/chap37.html" target="_blank"&gt;paralytic shellfish poisoning&lt;/a&gt;. The compounds involved are neurotoxins, poisons that attack the central nervous system, so they are particularly nasty, producing symptoms such as delirium and respiratory paralysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 22.  Pfiesteria sp." src="assets/Tutorial27_fig22pfisteria.jpg" title="Figure 22.  Pfiesteria sp." /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One red tide organism, &lt;a href="http://www.pfiesteria.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Pfiesteria&lt;/a&gt;, is unusual in that it uses toxins specifically to kill fish, stunning them and then feeding on their tissues (or on other protists that thrive on decaying fish). &lt;em&gt;Pfiesteria&lt;/em&gt; also produce some of the most ecologically severe red tides, sometimes killing enormous numbers of fish. It is not clear how &lt;em&gt;Pfiesteria&lt;/em&gt; affect humans, but there does seem to be considerable evidence that people exposed to its toxin by physical contact with affected fish or water containing &lt;em&gt;Pfiesteria&lt;/em&gt; suffer various symptoms (e.g., skin lesions and loss of cognitive function).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 23.  A satellite image from NOAA showing hot spots (in red) of Gymnodinium breve." src="assets/Tutorial27_fig23NOAA.jpg" title="Figure 23.  A satellite image from NOAA showing hot spots (in red) of Gymnodinium breve." /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HABs seem to be on the rise. Scientists believe that the enrichment of oceans and estuarine waters from fertilizer runoff has created an aquatic environment that favors dinoflagellate blooms. Research is underway to learn more about the causes of HABs, with the ultimate goal of designing viable control measures. This &lt;a href="http://www.noaanews.noaa.gov/stories/s584.htm" target="_blank"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt; offers a more thorough explanation of HAB causes and control strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;Can protists really be seen from space? They can if they cause red tides. NOAA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, sponsors many programs to monitor HABs using satellite imagery. The image shown here is from a study that is focused on the dinoflagellate &lt;em&gt;Gymnodinium breve&lt;/em&gt;, which causes HABs in the Gulf of Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Kingdom Alveolata: Apicomplexans&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Apicomplexans&lt;/strong&gt; are parasites, specialized for living and reproducing within the tissues of animals. The &lt;strong&gt;apical complex&lt;/strong&gt; is a cluster of microtubules and organelles located in the apex of cells that are in the &lt;strong&gt;sporozoite&lt;/strong&gt; (infectious stage). This structure&amp;#39;s function is to facilitate penetration of host cells. A number of apicomplexans require more than one host to complete their complicated life cycles. The infamous &lt;em&gt;Plasmodium&lt;/em&gt;, which causes &lt;a href="http://www.cdc.gov/malaria/index.htm" target="_blank"&gt;malaria&lt;/a&gt; in humans and other animals, is an apicomplexan transmitted by mosquitoes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 24. Plasmodium falciparum, an apicomplexan." src="assets/Tutorial27_fig24plasmodium.jpg" title="Figure 24. Plasmodium falciparum, an apicomplexan." /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More people are killed each year by malaria than by any other transmissible disease (besides tuberculosis); over one million people die each year from malaria (of approximately 515,000,000 infections every year), with the overwhelming majority of cases occurring in sub-Saharan Africa (and many others in Southeast Asia and South America). What&amp;#39;s more, malaria can strike a person multiple times per year, contributing to a major deficit in productivity, depriving families of income, and plunging many into deeper poverty. We have discussed the role that the sickle-cell allele plays in resistance to malaria; given the severity of the symptoms, it should not surprise you that this disease affects human microevolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 25. The life history of Plasmodium, the apicomplexan that causes malaria." src="assets/Tutorial27_fig25malaria.jpg" title="Figure 25. The life history of Plasmodium, the apicomplexan that causes malaria." /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many apicomplexan life cycles are quite complex, and &lt;em&gt;Plasmodium&lt;/em&gt; is no exception. The life stage that is transferred from an infected human to an &lt;em&gt;Anopheles&lt;/em&gt; mosquito is called a gametocyte (see figure 25). Within the gut of the mosquito, male and female gametocytes form gametes; male gametes then fertilize female gametes, creating a zygote. The zygote develops into an oocyst on the gut wall of the mosquito and ruptures to release thousands of sporozoites, which then migrate through the body of the mosquito and take up residence in its salivary glands. When the mosquito bites an animal, the sporozoites leave the salivary glands and migrate into the new host through the mouthparts of the mosquito, then through the new host&amp;#39;s bloodstream to the liver. In the liver, sporozoites transform to merozoites, which penetrate red blood cells in the host using the apical complex. Once in red blood cells, merozoites reproduce rapidly, producing many more merozoites, which burst out of the blood cells and penetrate new cells. Some of these merozoites form gametocytes, which can then be picked up by &lt;em&gt;Anopheles&lt;/em&gt; mosquitoes that bite the newly infected host, beginning the cycle again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Individuals who are heterozygotic for the sickle-cell allele have red blood cells that do not support the life cycle of the merozoites. This is also true for individuals who are homozygotic wild type. Hence, heterozygotes can be infected, but they do not exhibit the extreme symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More information on apicomplexans and malaria is available from &lt;a href="http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/protista/apicomplexa.html" target="_blank"&gt;UC-Berkeley&lt;/a&gt;. If you are interested in parasitic disease organisms, check out the &lt;a href="http://www.cdc.gov/az/a.html" target="_blank"&gt;CDC Disease Database&lt;/a&gt; for thorough, reliable information, along with some worthwhile images. The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) also offers an in-depth tutorial on the causes, treatments, and preventive measures for malaria at its &lt;a href="http://www.globalhealthlearning.org/login.cfm?logout=1" target="_blank"&gt;Global Health e-Learning Center&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Slime Molds&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Slime molds&lt;/strong&gt; used to be classified with the fungi, due to their heterotrophic feeding habits and appearance; we know these similarities likely arose independently in this group and hence the similarities between fungi and slime molds are an example of convergent evolution. We now know the slime molds are more closely related to amoeboid protists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 26. A myxomycete, or plasmodial slime mold." src="assets/Tutorial27_fig26myxomycete.jpg" title="Figure 26. A myxomycete, or plasmodial slime mold." /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Myxomycetes&lt;/em&gt;, or plasmodial slime molds, are among the most bizarre and beautiful creatures on Earth, often brilliantly colored in shades of yellow, orange, or pink. They are quite enormous and have given many a hapless gardener a good scare when found growing on a damp pile of bark mulch (see image above). Despite their size, plasmodial slime molds are unicellular; basically, they are large bags of cytoplasm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial27_fig27plasmodial_slime.jpg" title="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, within each &quot;cell&quot; are many nuclei. The synchronous division of these nuclei has made slime molds very useful research organisms for the study of mitosis; additionally, many scientists study cytoplasmic streaming (the circular flow of cytoplasm that aids in moving materials within the cell) in myxomycetes because it is a relatively easy phenomenon to observe due to the size of these organisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial27_fig%2028plasmodial_slime_mulch.jpg" title="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Acrasiomycetes&lt;/em&gt;, or cellular slime molds, are also very unusual organisms. They spend most of their lives as amoeba-like single cells, but when resources are scarce they converge, joining with other cells to form units that function as multicellular organisms. Unlike plasmodial slime molds, the cells within the acrasiomycetes retain their cell membranes and their ability to live independently. Cellular slime molds have become something of a model system for scientists studying the behaviors of individual cells and coordination among groups of cells. For more information on research involving cellular slime molds, visit the &quot;&lt;a href="http://dictybase.org/" target="_blank"&gt;DictyBase&lt;/a&gt;,&quot; a resource for the hundreds of researchers working on the cellular slime mold &lt;em&gt;Dictyostelium&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 29. Dictyostelium, an acrasiomycete or cellular slime mold." src="assets/Tutorial27_fig29dictyostellium.jpg" title="Figure 29. Dictyostelium, an acrasiomycete or cellular slime mold." /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Summary&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The protists are comprised of very diverse organisms that are polyphyletic in origin. Earlier taxonomic schemes that grouped all of these organisms into one giant kingdom were not very informative because they were not based on the evolutionary relationships between different protistan groups. The modern classification scheme presented here is considered superior because it does take into account these ancestral relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you learned, not all eukaryotes have mitochondria. Keep in mind that their lifestyle (as microsymbionts) does not require these organelles because they are quite successful living in the manner that they do (albeit, sometimes at the expense of their hosts).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Members of the kingdom Euglenozoa do have mitochondria, but are a diverse group in terms of structure. All euglenoids have a flagellum, whereas the kinetoplastids have a kinetoplast. The euglenoids are typically free-living (and can be photoautotrophic), whereas the kinetoplastids are all microsymbionts (some, like the trypanosomes, are pathogenic).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Members of Kingdom Alveolata are even more diverse. They include the dinoflagellates that are involved in such diverse activities as coral reef building and that cause various forms of red tide. They play a major role in the ecology of deep-ocean communities because they comprise a significant portion of the phytoplankton that a variety of ocean species ingest (including whales).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The apicomplexans all form parasitic symbioses, therefore, they have a major impact on other life. The causative agent of malaria is caused by &lt;em&gt;Plasmodium&lt;/em&gt;. More people are killed each year by malaria than by any other transmissible disease (besides tuberculosis). Keep in mind the importance of understanding a pathogen&amp;#39;s life cycle when public health decisions need to be made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also briefly introduced the slime molds. Taxonomists really don&amp;#39;t know how to classify these organisms. In a hike through the woods, you might encounter a brightly colored, fungus-like structure spreading over the surface of a decaying tree trunk; most likely, you are observing a slime mold.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <title>Energy IV - Photosynthesis (Light Reactions)</title>
    <body>&lt;h2&gt;Terms&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should have a working knowledge of the following terms:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;algae&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;carotenoid&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;chlorophyll&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;thylakoid&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;wavelength&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Z-scheme&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Introduction and Goals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The majority of life on Earth could not exist without &lt;strong&gt;photosynthesis&lt;/strong&gt;. Recall from the section on &lt;a href="https://online.science.psu.edu/biol110_sandbox_2381/node/8987" target="_blank" title="Tutorial 21 - Energy I - Thermodynamics"&gt;Thermodynamics&lt;/a&gt; that during photosynthesis light energy is converted to chemical energy. Specifically, it is the process whereby plants, protists, and some bacteria use light, water, and carbon dioxide to make sugars. Photosynthesis is not the exact opposite of cellular respiration, but rather a separate process that just so happens to contain many similar features (e.g., the electron transport chain).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 1.  The Electromagnetic Spectrum." src="assets/Tutorial28_Fig1_28.jpg" title="Figure 1.  The Electromagnetic Spectrum." /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photosynthesis can be divided into two parts: the light reactions and the light-independent reactions (also referred to as the &quot;dark&quot; reactions). This tutorial will cover the light reactions. This is when light energy is transformed into energy that can be used by cells. The next tutorial will cover the light-independent reactions, which is when sugar is actually made.&lt;br /&gt;
	By the end of this tutorial you should have an understanding of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Plants&amp;#39; requirements for photosynthesis and respiration&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The light reactions of photosynthesis&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Characteristics of light&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Channeling of light energy&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Electron transport chains and the Z-scheme&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Generation of ATP.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Photosynthesis&amp;#39; Light Reactions: An Overview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists are always looking for alternative energy sources. Everyone has heard of solar-powered cars, and we tend to think of them as a new technology. Plants, however, have always been solar powered. In fact, humans (and other heterotrophs) are dependent on the ability of plants to transform light energy into chemical energy via the process of photosynthesis. Humans transform stored chemical energy into mechanical energy and heat. Solar-powered cars rely on the sun&amp;#39;s energy being transformed into electrical energy (&lt;strong&gt;photochemistry&lt;/strong&gt;). In each of these cases energy is being transformed but never created or destroyed. This should be familiar as the &lt;a assets/tutorial-21-energy-i-%E2%80%93-thermodynamics." target="_blank" title="Tutorial 21 - Energy I - Thermodynamics"&gt;first law of thermodynamics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metabolism refers to all of the chemical processes in a cell. It is usually divided into two categories: catabolism and anabolism. Cellular respiration is an example of catabolism, whereas photosynthesis is an anabolic process.&lt;br /&gt;
	While most people think of plants when photosynthesis is mentioned, &lt;strong&gt;algae&lt;/strong&gt; actually undergo much more photosynthesis than plants. It has been estimated that about 90% of the oxygen produced from photosynthesis comes from algae and phytoplankton living in oceans. Plants, protists, and even some bacteria undergo photosynthesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Plants Undergo Photosynthesis and Cellular Respiration&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote style="text-align: center;"&gt;cellular respiration: sugar + oxygen --&gt; carbon dioxide + water + energy to do cellular work&lt;br /&gt;
	photosynthesis: light energy + carbon dioxide + water --&gt; oxygen + sugar&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many plants have cells, tissues, and organs that do not photosynthesize. For example, most roots have no photosynthetic capacity. Typically sugars are produced in the photosynthetic tissues and transported to other areas of the plant for immediate nutrition and storage. As already discussed, cellular respiration is required for cells to convert the chemical energy in sugars into ATP. Therefore plants must also undergo cellular respiration in all cells in order to function properly.&lt;br /&gt;
	Remember, plants have mitochondria and chloroplasts. Therefore they are able to carry out photosynthesis and cellular respiration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Wave-Like Character of Light&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photosynthesis requires light. But what is light? To answer this question, we will answer three other questions in the next few pages:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Where does light come from?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;How does light travel from place to place?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;What happens when light reaches an object?&lt;br /&gt;
		Sunlight comes from thermonuclear reactions in the sun, which release energy in the form of &lt;strong&gt;electromagnetic radiation&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
		Light has wave and particle characteristics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, let&amp;#39;s look at the wave properties. Light is similar to x-rays, microwaves, and radio waves because they all have a periodic fluctuating character (a wave) that travels through space. They differ because of their &lt;strong&gt;wavelengths&lt;/strong&gt; (the peak-to-peak distance between oscillations). Importantly, electromagnetic waves can transfer energy to objects in their paths. Light, as shown in Figure 1, is the portion of the electromagnetic spectrum that has wavelengths detectable by the human eye. These are wavelengths of about 400-700nm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Particle-Like Character of Light&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If light acts as a wave that travels through space, how can it also act as a particle that bumps into things as it travels? Light travels as &quot;packets,&quot; or quanta of energy known as photons. Each photon has a specific amount of energy. In fact, photons do &quot;bump&quot; into things in their path. These disturbances cause some of the effects of light in the world around us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 2.  Absorption Spectrum of Chlorophyll." src="assets/Tutorial28_Fig2_28.jpg" title="Figure 2.  Absorption Spectrum of Chlorophyll." /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This brings us back to the third question posed about light. What happens when light reaches another object? We have all seen light reflect off of a mirror, hence we can see ourselves. We have also avoided wearing a black shirt (compared to a white shirt) in the summer because of the heat it absorbs. These two properties of reflection and absorption can help us to understand how plants use light.&lt;br /&gt;
	Because light consists of photons of energy, reflection can be thought of as photons bouncing off of a leaf. However sometimes the photons of light are absorbed by the leaf to do work. Pigments are compounds that absorb light. Different pigments absorb different wavelengths of light. If a structure (e.g., a leaf) lacks pigments that absorb light in a given wavelength range, then that wavelength of light will be reflected. In other words, the color perceived is that which is not absorbed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Light Energy is Channeled by Photosystems&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The leaves of deciduous trees turn colors and fall off in autumn. The multitude of colors come from pigments (e.g., carotenoids). These pigments exist in the leaf all summer, but it is not until the pigment chlorophyll is depleted that the other colors become obvious. Why might a plant have these other pigments?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial28_fig3_28.jpg" title="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In eukaryotes the light reactions of photosynthesis occur in the &lt;strong&gt;thylakoids&lt;/strong&gt; of &lt;strong&gt;chloroplasts&lt;/strong&gt;. Chloroplasts appear as stacked structures. These stacks are called &lt;strong&gt;grana&lt;/strong&gt;, which consist of thylakoids that are actually flattened membranes. Thylakoids house the essential components of the light reactions of photosynthesis. The thylakoid is covered with several types of pigments arranged in &lt;strong&gt;photosystems&lt;/strong&gt;. (This figure depicts chlorophyll molecules embedded in a photosystem.) There are two types of photosystems, and each consists of a few hundred pigment molecules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial28_Fig4_28.jpg" title="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a photon strikes a pigment molecule, its energy is passed from pigment molecule to pigment molecule until it reaches the reaction center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The various pigments each absorb light of a different wavelength , and they send this energy to a specialized chlorophyll molecule at the center of the photosystem (the reaction center). The chlorophyll molecules of photosystem I and photosystem II are different but both play an important role in the electron transport chains of photosynthesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know that light is absorbed by pigments, but how does the plant make use of the photons of energy? A pigment is a molecule made up of atoms that contain electrons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recall from earlier tutorials, electrons are found in association with atoms, where they can participate in bond formation. Electrons have varying amounts of energy. In a non-illuminated pigment (one in the dark), critical electrons are usually found in a low energy state. However, the energy from an incoming photon can bump the electron into a higher energy state. If a photon of light resonates with a particular pigment, it has enough energy to raise a particular electron in the pigment to the next state. When this happens, light has been absorbed and energy has been transferred. Each photosystem has an electron acceptor that ultimately renews the energized electrons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="0" src="http://c.gigcount.com/wildfire/IMP/CXNID=2000002.0NXC/bT*xJmx*PTEzMTAxNzg1OTk3NTkmcHQ9MTMxMDE3ODYwMzQ*NSZwPTIwNjQyMSZkPWIyMTQyMTIwJmc9MiZvPTk2NjhhNGRlZDA4/NDRmNzlhYTY1ZTI4N2RlOTA2Y2E4Jm9mPTA=.gif" style="visibility: hidden; width: 0px; height: 0px;" width="0" /&gt;&lt;object height="480" width="640"&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2142120" /&gt;&lt;param name="wmode" value="transparent" /&gt;&lt;embed height="480" src="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2142120" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="640" wmode="transparent"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Electron Transport Chain: The Z-Scheme&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;You were introduced to the electron transport chain in the tutorial on &lt;a assets/tutorial-23-energy-iii-cellular-respiration-krebs-cycle-electron-transport-chain." target="_blank" title="Tutorial 23 - Energy III - Cellular Respiration (Krebs Cycle and Electron Transport Chain)"&gt;cellular respiration&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial28_Fg5_28.jpg" title="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is simply a series of redox reactions. There are two electron transport chains used in photosynthesis. They are energetically linked to one another, and electrons traverse through both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, light is absorbed by pigments and its energy is channeled to chlorophyll, where it excites an electron. (This is &lt;strong&gt;photosystem II&lt;/strong&gt;.) The electron is then transferred to the primary electron acceptor. From there it rolls downhill, energetically speaking. It loses some energy as it is passed from molecule to molecule through the chain. The electron ends up at a second type of chlorophyll molecule in &lt;strong&gt;photosystem I&lt;/strong&gt;. Light is absorbed and the electron is once again excited and transferred along the chain. When this process is diagrammed, it looks like the letter Z on its side. The electron gets excited, comes back down in energy, gets excited again, and comes back down again. Thus, the two electron transport chains are called the &lt;strong&gt;Z-scheme&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind, water is the source of the electrons. As shown in this figure, electrons are removed from water in photosystem II, and consequently, these electrons become energized into a more energetic state. Protons and oxygen are released as by-products of this reaction.&lt;br /&gt;
	The electron transport chain of respiration occurs in the mitochondria, whereas the electron transport chains of photosynthesis are located in the chloroplasts. The thylakoid membrane is home to the many proteins involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Electron Transport Chain: Redox&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Free energy is released during redox reactions. In photosynthesis this energy is used for two things. First, hydrogen ions are moved across the membrane. The hydrogen ions really only consist of a single proton, and will be referred to that way throughout this tutorial. Remember that the electron loses some energy as it is passed along the electron transport chain because energy is required to pump the protons. The protons are moved into the thylakoid space where they accumulate; energy is required because these protons are being moved against a concentration gradient. (In other words, this is not passive diffusion.) The second use of free energy is reduction of an ultimate electron acceptor. At the end of the first electron transport chain, the electron is transferred to another molecule of chlorophyll. At the end of the second electron transport chain, the final acceptor of the electron is &lt;strong&gt;NADP+&lt;/strong&gt;, which is reduced to &lt;strong&gt;NADPH&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember that this process is happening inside the cell. Where do all of these electrons come from? You learned earlier that water is the source. Water molecules are split at the beginning of the first electron transport chain. This provides electrons that become energized in the photosystems, and protons that accumulate across the membrane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As water is split and electrons are removed (along with protons), oxygen is released. Thus, oxygen is a by-product of photosynthesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Generation of ATP&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Light energy can be transduced to reduce NADP+ to NADPH, and to supply energy for the accumulation of protons across the thylakoid membrane and into the thylakoid space. This occurs in algal protists and plants. (Bacteria have no chloroplasts, but they do sequester protons in one area.) The thylakoid membrane prevents protons from moving back across to the other side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial28_Fig6_28.jpg" title="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The charge separation across the thylakoid membrane represents stored energy in the form of a voltage (similar to what happens within mitochondria during cellular respiration). This figure compares ATP synthesis in the two organelles. As shown, chloroplasts also make use of the voltage via ATP synthase proteins in the membrane. These are similar to the ATP synthase molecules associated with cellular respiration. In a process called &lt;strong&gt;photophosphorylation&lt;/strong&gt;, they harness the energy from protons moving across the membrane to make ATP from ADP and phosphate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="0" src="http://c.gigcount.com/wildfire/IMP/CXNID=2000002.0NXC/bT*xJmx*PTEzMTAxNzg2ODUxMjQmcHQ9MTMxMDE3ODY4Nzc2NSZwPTIwNjQyMSZkPWIyMTQyMTM2Jmc9MiZvPTk2NjhhNGRlZDA4/NDRmNzlhYTY1ZTI4N2RlOTA2Y2E4Jm9mPTA=.gif" style="visibility: hidden; width: 0px; height: 0px;" width="0" /&gt;&lt;object height="480" width="640"&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2142136" /&gt;&lt;param name="wmode" value="transparent" /&gt;&lt;embed height="480" src="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2142136" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="640" wmode="transparent"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tutorial has focused on the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis, or: light + water --&gt; NADPH + ATP; water provided the electrons and protons, resulting in oxygen as a by-product. Light excites the electrons, and it is the original source of energy for every step in the process. The transfer of electrons in the electron transport chain moves protons. This creates a voltage that is used to make ATP. The electrons complete their journey by reducing NADP+ to NADPH.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NADPH and ATP hold energy that can be used to build molecules. Next we will explore how these molecules are used to synthesize sugars.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <title>Energy V – Photosynthesis (Calvin Cycle)</title>
    <body>&lt;h1&gt;Terms&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should have a working knowledge of the following terms:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Calvin cycle&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;carbon cycle&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;chromatography&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (G3P)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;ribulose bisphosphate (RuBP)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;rubisco&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;stoma (pl. stomata)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Introduction and Goals&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last tutorial explored the light reactions of photosynthesis. These reactions begin with the absorption of light energy by pigments, and end with the production of stored chemical energy in the form of NADPH and ATP. Now we will follow the NADPH and ATP molecules as they enter the &lt;strong&gt;Calvin cycle&lt;/strong&gt;. Their stored energy will be used to make sugar from carbon dioxide. These anabolic reactions are endergonic (have a positive delta G), and therefore require energy (from ATP and NADPH). The basic relationship between the Calvin cycle and the light reactions is summarized in this figure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial29_Fig1_29.jpg" title="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These reactions are sometimes called the &quot;dark reactions&quot; because they can occur in the dark (as long as ATP and NADPH are available). All of the processes of photosynthesis (light and dark reactions) occur within the chloroplast. By the end of this tutorial you should have a basic working understanding of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The energetics of photosynthesis&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The basic workings of the Calvin cycle (including the fixation, reduction, and regeneration phases)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Energetics&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we begin our study of the Calvin cycle, let&amp;#39;s look at the energetics (total energy relations and transformations of a system) of sugar synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have already studied the catabolism (breakdown) of glucose during cellular respiration. You know that the process is exergonic and releases about 686 kcal of energy. Thus, the delta G for the overall reaction is -686 kcal/mole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;glucose + O2 --&gt; CO2 + H2O + ATP&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If 686 kcal of energy per mole are released in the process of respiration, then it follows that 686 kcal of energy (minimum) are required to produce one mole of glucose. (Remember the first law of thermodynamics?) The Calvin cycle is the process by which glucose is made, and it requires all of that energy. Where does the energy come from? The light reactions of photosynthesis produce ATP, which provides the Calvin cycle with the necessary energy. In addition, the NADPH produced by the light reactions provides the reducing power to put glucose together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;sunlight + CO2 + H2O --&gt; O2 + glucose&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Overview of the Calvin Cycle&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The light reactions of photosynthesis produce ATP and NADPH, which are then used in glucose synthesis during the Calvin cycle. As you should know from studying the Krebs cycle, metabolic cycles involve inputs and outputs, but some molecules are recycled to go full circle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial29_Fig2_29.jpg" title="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of the Calvin Cycle, the input molecules are carbon dioxide, ATP, and NADPH. The output molecules are sugar, ADP, NADP+, and inorganic phosphate (Pi). The recycled molecule is &lt;strong&gt;ribulose bisphosphate (RuBP&lt;/strong&gt;). Look at this figure and take a moment to locate these molecules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Calvin&amp;#39;s Methods&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientific knowledge is gained through observations and controlled experiments, but how does one study a process that can&amp;#39;t be seen directly?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial29_Fig3_29.jpg" title="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 50 years ago, Melvin Calvin tried to do just that. He was working in a laboratory at the University of California, Berkeley during WWII. The study of radioactive elements had become an important new field in chemistry during the war. Among these newly discovered radioactive elements was carbon14. On the day in 1945 that the Japanese surrendered, a friend and colleague told Calvin, &quot;Now is the time to do something useful with radioactive carbon.&quot; Calvin turned his focus to the study of photosynthesis, and 16 years later he won a Nobel Prize in chemistry and a metabolic process was named after him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calvin knew that photosynthesis could only occur in living organisms. Thus, the study of the chemical process was a difficult one. He devised a method whereby he could raise algae (&lt;em&gt;Chlorella pyrenoidosa&lt;/em&gt;) in a lollipop-shaped disk (see photo). He set up a stream of air that could be controlled. He could inject radioactive carbon as carbon dioxide into the air stream for a set period of time. Then he would kill the algae with boiling methanol to stop the process of photosynthesis. He ran the experiment multiple times, each time killing the algae at different lengths of time after injecting carbon14.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calvin analyzed the dead algae to determine which molecules had incorporated the carbon14. The technique he used is called &lt;strong&gt;chromatography&lt;/strong&gt;. By comparing the molecules that contained carbon14 after each time period, he found a sequence of compounds that revealed the path of carbon dioxide as it was turned into glucose. In the years that followed, other researchers have discovered the enzymes and other compounds that also function in the Calvin cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calvin first saw a three-carbon compound that was radioactively labeled. This led him to conclude that there was a two-carbon compound that was binding to the carbon dioxide, fixing it into an organic compound. However, when he stopped the process almost immediately after injecting carbon dioxide, he found a six-carbon compound. It turns out that carbon dioxide is initially fixed (i.e., taken out of the gas phase) by joining to a five-carbon compound. The resulting six-carbon compound is so unstable that it very quickly breaks into two, three-carbon compounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The carbon dioxide needed for this part of the Calvin cycle can get to the chloroplast in several different ways. In algae it simply diffuses through membranes from the surrounding water. In plants the carbon dioxide comes in through pores (&lt;strong&gt;stomata&lt;/strong&gt;) in the leaves and uses one of several mechanisms to get to the chloroplasts. These same pores are where oxygen, produced in the light reactions, escapes into the atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first phase of the Calvin cycle, carbon dioxide is fixed into a 6-carbon molecule, which splits into two, 3-carbon molecules. In the second phase (shown in this figure), the 3-carbon molecules are reduced to &lt;strong&gt;glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (G3P)&lt;/strong&gt;, another 3-carbon molecule. Remember, reduction means that electrons are added to the molecule. NADPH, produced during the light reactions, provides the high-energy electrons for this process. Also in this reduction phase, some ATP is used. Thus, the Calvin cycle is energetically tied to the light reactions of photosynthesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Regeneration of G3P to RuBP&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As shown in these two figures, the Krebs cycle and the Calvin cycle have some general similarities. Remember, the Krebs cycle regenerates oxaloacetate at the end of one cycle to begin the next. In much the same way, the Calvin cycle regenerates RuBP to begin the next cycle. For every three carbon dioxide molecules that are fixed, three molecules of RuBP were needed. Thus, at the end of the cycle there must be three molecules of RuBP or the cycle would get out of balance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial29_Fig2d_29.jpg" title="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three molecules of RuBP that began the cycle had a total of three carbons multiplied by five molecules, or 15 atoms of carbon. Three molecules of carbon were then fixed for a surplus of three carbons in the cycle. Those three carbons are expelled from the cycle as one molecule of G3P. The remaining 15 carbons are still in the form of G3P. Therefore, they must be converted back to RuBP to start the process again. More ATP, as well as many steps involving enzymes, are necessary to do this regeneration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial29_Fig4_29.jpg" title="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although we commonly think about the Calvin cycle occurring in this simple form, it is important to keep in mind the complexity of the cell. Our simplification of the Calvin cycle shows that a given chloroplast only has one enzyme for each step in the cycle. You need to remember that each chloroplast has a multitude of each type of enzyme. Thus, hundreds of molecules are going through this cycle at once. Before proceeding to the next page, click on the image of the Calvin cycle and note where NADPH is first used. The next question will ask what the consequences would be if NADPH levels were to suddenly drop. (In the absence of the reducing power of NADPH, what intermediate of the Calvin Cycle would begin to accumulate?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Global Warming&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carbon dioxide is constantly being fixed into sugars (and other macromolecules), which, in turn, are oxidized back into CO2. This relationship, on a global scale, is termed the &lt;strong&gt;carbon cycle&lt;/strong&gt;. However, humans are burning fossil fuels at a faster rate than plants can fix them back into sugars and other carbon molecules. Therefore, the global carbon cycle is out of balance. Or is it? Some scientists think that the current rise in CO2 levels is part of a natural cycle (rising and falling CO2 levels) that has been going on for millions of years. Thus, there are cycles within cycles, each interacting with and affecting the others. For more information on global warming, visit these sites:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Summary&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have finished our discussion of photosynthesis by showing the major anabolic pathway that results in the reduction of carbon dioxide to various sugars (including glucose). The formation of sugars is energetically unfavorable, as can be predicted from the positive ?G for the formation of glucose from carbon dioxide and water. The energy and reducing power for this process comes from the light-dependent reactions, which were presented in the last tutorial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, the Calvin cycle is a collection of enzymes that work to introduce carbon dioxide into the anabolic pathway involved in sugar production. Keep in mind, there are some variations on how carbon is initially fixed (depending on the species of photosynthetic organism), but they all have the enzymes that are involved in the Calvin cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carbon dioxide enters the Calvin cycle by being added to the 5-carbon compound called ribulose bisphosphate (RuBP). This reaction, involving the enzyme rubisco (the most abundant protein on Earth), results in a 6-carbon compound that is very unstable and is rapidly split into two, 3-carbon molecules. The resulting 3-carbon compound is activated by phosphorylation (via ATP obtained from the light-driven reactions of photosynthesis), then reduced by NADPH (again, obtained from the light-driven reactions of photosynthesis). After reduction, a 3-carbon molecule, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (G3P), exists. G3P has two fates. Some molecules go on to form more molecules of RuBP (which requires additional ATP; again derived from the light-driven photosynthetic reactions). Some molecules exit the Calvin cycle to form sugars (including glucose).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are curious about how sugars are formed from G3P, you might want to review the glycolytic pathway and find G3P. If you go backwards, you will see the pathway that is involved in the production of glucose. Other sugars can be made using other metabolic pathways.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

&lt;h2&gt;Introduction and Goals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tutorial will cover the last three protist kingdoms. They have members that are mostly photosynthetic; additionally, many members have a profound influence on humanity. Several links have been added for your interest; however, you will not be tested on material outside of the text within this tutorial. We will begin with a discussion of Kingdom Stramenopila, which includes the diatoms, water molds, and brown algae. Next we will examine Kingdom Rhodophyta (the red algae), and will conclude with Kingdom Chlorophyta (green algae). By the end of this tutorial you should have a fundamental understanding of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The life histories and classifications of Kingdoms Stramenopila, Rhodophyta and Chlorophyta, and Phyla Bacillariophyta, Chrysophyta, Oomycota, and Phaeophyta&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The organisms that caused the &quot;Great Potato Famine&quot; in Ireland, and the outbreak of downy mildew that nearly destroyed the French wine industry&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The basic characteristics of algae, seaweeds, and kelps&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The mode of sexual reproduction known as alternation of generations&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The relationship between plants and photosynthetic protists&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Introduction to Kingdom Stramenopila&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stramenopilans&lt;/strong&gt; are a remarkably diverse, yet monophyletic group that includes: planktonic diatoms, whose microscopic glassy shells comprise diatomaceous earth; large multicellular marine seaweeds (brown algae or phaeophytes); and water molds, which include the pathogen responsible for the potato blight that drove millions of people in Ireland hungry in the nineteenth century. Although this group is diverse, they all share a common ancestral trait. Namely, the presence of hair-like projections on their flagella; &quot;stramen&quot; means flagellum in Latin, and &quot;pilos&quot; means hair; hence, stramenopilans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial30_fig1_30.jpg" title="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Kingdom Stramenopila: Phylum Bacillariophyta (Diatoms)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diatoms are very important from a global perspective. Marine and freshwater plankton are full of photosynthetic diatoms. Some estimates suggest that they may be responsible for over 20% of annual global carbon fixation. &lt;strong&gt;Diatoms&lt;/strong&gt; are encased in a glass-like &lt;strong&gt;silica&lt;/strong&gt; shell, lined with perforations to allow gas exchange at the cell surface. These shells, invisible to the naked eye, are exceptionally beautiful structures. Each one consists of two components that fit together, like the bottom and lid of a pillbox. After the death of individual diatoms, their microscopic shells sink and gradually form thick layers of sediment (diatomaceous earth). Living diatoms avoid sinking by regulating their cellular ion concentrations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial30_fig2_30.jpg" title="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diatomaceous earth, which essentially consists of microscopic fragments of glass, has numerous applications. For example, it is commonly used as a diatomaceous earth pesticide; the sharp edges of diatom shells scrape arthropod exoskeletons and gut linings, causing water loss and eventually death by desiccation. It also damages the tissues of worms and other small creatures, and often is incorporated into animal feed to reduce the occurrence of intestinal parasites. It has myriad other uses (e.g., giving scouring power to cleaning products, and allowing ultrafine filtration for scientific applications and water-purification systems).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial30_fig3_30.jpg" title="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Silica shells are fairly inert, and diatomaceous earth tends to stay where it settles. Therefore, scientists can look at the assemblages of diatom species in soil cores taken from diatomaceous earth, where the deepest layers of the sample are the oldest and represent the most distant past. They can date the samples and examine changes in the number of warm-climate diatom species and cool-climate species over time, gaining clues about ancient climatic patterns. Actually, it is not quite this simple. Other factors, besides temperature, can influence the diatom species found. Also, scientists do not know the temperature preferences of extinct diatom species discovered in samples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial30_fig4_30.jpg" title="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diatoms are mostly photosynthetic, but there are also heterotrophic species. Cell division in diatoms was discusssed in the tutorial on &lt;a href="https://online.science.psu.edu/biol110_sandbox_2381/node/8970" title="Tutorial 25 - Mitosis-Cell Cycle Regulation"&gt;Mitosis-Cell Cycle Regulation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Kingdom Stramenopila: Phylum Chrysophyta (Golden Algae)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial30_fig5_30_0.jpg" style="width: 337px; height: 284px;" title="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chrysophytes are planktonic organisms that possess a rich golden color due to the presence of carotenoids and xanthophylls. These &lt;strong&gt;accessory pigments&lt;/strong&gt; allow them to expand the range of light wavelengths they can use during photosynthesis. Many golden algae are predators (as well as being photoautotrophic), using &lt;strong&gt;pseudopodia&lt;/strong&gt; to prey on smaller organisms (e.g., diatoms and bacteria). Some possess silica scales, similar in composition to the shells of diatoms; silica also coats the quiescent cysts that form under unfavorable conditions, allowing chrysophytes to remain dormant for decades. Most chrysophytes are unicellular, but some species are colonial and quite elaborate in structure (e.g., &lt;em&gt;Synura&lt;/em&gt; sp. colony pictured below).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial20_nitrogen_cycle_0.jpg" title="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Kingdom Stramenopila: Phylum Oomycota&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oomycetes include the water molds and downy mildews. Some are unicellular, and many others are colonial. Most are heterotrophic decomposers that feed on dead and decaying organic matter in aquatic and terrestrial environments, but a number attack living plants and animals. The name &quot;oomycete&quot; means &quot;egg fungi,&quot; which is a reference to the reproductive structures of sexually reproducing oomycetes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial30_fig7_30.jpg" title="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although oomycetes are not closely related to fungi, the two groups have some similarities. In particular, both groups are heterotrophs that break down food externally and then absorb nutrients from their surroundings. Additionally, many of the multicellular oomycetes form &lt;strong&gt;hyphae&lt;/strong&gt;, which are very similar to fungal hyphae although the structures are not identical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial30_fig8_30.jpg" title="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there are more differences than similarities. For example, the cell walls of oomycetes are composed of cellulose, not chitin (the compound found in the cell walls of fungi). Unlike true fungi, which are haploid in the feeding stage, the hyphae of most oomycetes are composed of diploid cells. Furthermore, the presence of the storage compound mycolaminarin, along with molecular evidence and the presence of flagellated cells similar to those of other stramenopiles, indicate that oomycetes belong within Kingdom Stramenopila.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The resemblance between fungi and oomycetes is an example of &lt;strong&gt;convergent evolution&lt;/strong&gt;, the process by which unrelated organisms that occupy similar environments evolve similar functional traits. For example, oomycetes and fungi are decomposers and therefore stand to gain an advantage from maximizing their surface area for the absorption of food; thus, the filamentous growth form might have been favored by independent evolution in both lineages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Oomycetes Impact on Humans&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oomycetes have been responsible for a number of catastrophic historical events, including the outbreak of downy mildew that nearly wiped out the French wine industry in the late nineteenth century. &lt;em&gt;Plasmopara&lt;/em&gt;, a native of the New World, was inadvertently brought to France from the United States in 1870 in a shipment of American grape root stock. It quickly became a devastating problem. A mixture of lime and copper sulfate, the first chemicals used to combat a plant pathogen, solved the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial30_fig10_30.jpg" title="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The oomycete Phytophthora infestans, or potato blight, was responsible for another cataclysmic event, the Great Potato Famine, which killed nearly one-million people in Ireland in the late 1800s, and drove one-and-a-half-million more out of the country. &lt;em&gt;Phytophthora&lt;/em&gt; secretes enzymes that break down leaf and stem tissue, killing plants very rapidly. Tubers can become infested, turning soft and black, seemingly overnight. Potato fields in Ireland became infested with &lt;em&gt;Phytophthora&lt;/em&gt;, which thrived in the cool damp climate of Ireland and wiped out nearly the entire country&amp;#39;s crop in one week. In nineteenth-century Ireland, potatoes were the primary food source of the poorest classes, who often grew nothing other than potatoes. The loss of this staple crop led to mass starvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial30_fig11_30.jpg" title="" /&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial30_fig12_30.jpg" title="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Kingdom Stramenopila: Phylum Phaeophyta (Brown Algae)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phaeophytes, or brown algae, include the largest of the protists, with some growing over 100 feet in length. The giant multicellular species that comprise &quot;kelp forests&quot; in temperate marine waters belong to this group. The edible alga &quot;kombu,&quot; which is harvested by the Japanese, is also a phaeophyte. It is particularly rich in minerals, as are other marine algae. Like the chrysophytes, phaeophytes contain specific accessory pigments that give them their characteristic colors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial20_nitrogen_cycle.jpg" title="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with the two kingdoms that we will discuss next, Rhodophyta and Chlorophyta, Phylum Phaeophyta includes a number of &lt;strong&gt;seaweeds&lt;/strong&gt;. Although it is not a taxonomic term, the word &quot;seaweed&quot; is a useful way of distinguishing large intertidal algae from other species (e.g., planktonic algae). Many types of seaweed, including those within the Phylum Phaeophyta, have complex structures that are reminiscent of plants. The &lt;strong&gt;thallus&lt;/strong&gt; refers to the entire body of any seaweed that is plant-like in appearance. The thallus consists of three main parts: a &lt;strong&gt;stipe&lt;/strong&gt;, which is analogous to the stem of plants; a &lt;strong&gt;holdfast&lt;/strong&gt;, which secures the seaweed to a substrate; and leaf-like &lt;strong&gt;blades&lt;/strong&gt;, which provide extensive surface area for photosynthesis, much as leaves do for plants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial30_fig14_30.jpg" title="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another word used informally to describe a specific type of alga is &quot;&lt;strong&gt;kelp&lt;/strong&gt;,&quot; which refers to giant seaweeds that grow in the deeper waters outside of the intertidal zone. All kelps, which form vast &quot;forests&quot; that support thriving marine ecosystems, are phaeophytes. As one can see (left), these organisms can reach very impressive sizes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial30_fig15_30.jpg" title="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Alternation of Generations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recall from the tutorial on &lt;a href="https://online.science.psu.edu/biol110_sandbox_2381/node/8978" title="Tutorial 2 - Heredity and Life Cycles"&gt;Heredity and Life Cycles&lt;/a&gt; that life cycles were discussed. In this discussion, alternation of generations was introduced. Although there is great variety in modes of reproduction among algae, we will focus on alternation of generations (the most complex of their life cycles). It occurs in Phylum Phaeophyta and in the two kingdoms that we will discuss next, the Rhodophyta and the Chlorophyta. This type of life cycle is also seen in more complex organisms. For example, plants also alternate generations during sexual reproduction, as do fungi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alternation of generations&lt;/strong&gt; refers specifically to the alternation between multicellular haploid life stages and multicellular diploid life stages. The key feature is that both the diploid and haploid stages are multicellular. Diploid forms (sporophytes) produce haploid spores, which divide and develop directly into multicellular haploid structures (gametophytes). Gametophytes then produce haploid gametes, which join with other gametes to form diploid sporophytes once again. In other words, the diploid and haploid generations alternate, over and over. In some organisms the diploid stage is the dominant form that is responsible for the majority of growth and resource acquisition, whereas in others (e.g., fungi) the haploid stage is dominant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brown alga &lt;em&gt;Laminaria&lt;/em&gt; is a model for alternation of generations. Laminaria reproduces with &lt;strong&gt;heteromorphic&lt;/strong&gt; alternation of generations (shown below under Chlorophyta). That is, the haploid and diploid stages exhibit different forms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="0" src="http://c.gigcount.com/wildfire/IMP/CXNID=2000002.0NXC/bT*xJmx*PTEzMTAyNDM3Mzc*OTImcHQ9MTMxMDI*Mzc*ODQxNSZwPTIwNjQyMSZkPWIyMTQyOTAyJmc9MiZvPTk2NjhhNGRlZDA4/NDRmNzlhYTY1ZTI4N2RlOTA2Y2E4Jm9mPTA=.gif" style="visibility:hidden;width:0px;height:0px;" width="0" /&gt;&lt;object height="480" width="640"&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2142902" /&gt;&lt;param name="wmode" value="transparent" /&gt;&lt;embed height="480" src="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2142902" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="640" wmode="transparent"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Kingdom Rhodophyta&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Members of Kingdom Rhodophyta differ from other eukaryotic algae because they do not have flagellated cells at any point in their life cycles. DNA sequence data (and other sources) indicate that this lineage arose independently, sometime before Kingdom Stramenopila.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial30_fig16_30.jpg" title="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;Most &lt;strong&gt;rhodophytes&lt;/strong&gt; are marine algae, but a number of species live in freshwater and some even inhabit terrestrial niches. Alternation of generations occurs frequently in Kingdom Rhodophyta. Like many of the photosynthetic eukaryotes, rhodophytes are characterized by accessory pigments in their chloroplasts, which endow them with unique colors. In the case of rhodophytes, also called red algae, pigments called &lt;strong&gt;phycobilins&lt;/strong&gt; produce rich shades of pink, scarlet, and red that are so deep that they approach black. These red pigments, in particular the phycobilin phycoerythrin, allow rhodophytes to photosynthesize at depths where only high-energy blue and green light can penetrate. In fact, the color of rhodophyte species tends to be correlated with the depth where they commonly occur; deep-water species are often nearly black, concentrated with phycoerythrin, whereas shallow-water species can contain so few accessory pigments that they appear almost green, having few pigments to mask the green color of chlorophyll.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many red algae are large multicellular organisms, although they are not in the same size class as the largest of the brown algae. A number of these species are of economic importance; the odds are very good that you&amp;#39;ve eaten red algae or that you have relied on its derivatives. The seaweed used in sushi (nori) is a red alga.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Kingdom Chlorophyta&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial30_fig17_30.jpg" title="" /&gt; &lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial30_fig18_30.jpg" title="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chlorophytes, or green algae, resemble plants more closely than do any of the other photosynthetic protists. In fact, some classification systems group members of Kingdom Chlorophyta with plants on the premise that green algae actually resemble plants more closely than they resemble other protists. The chlorophyll of green algae (chlorophyll &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt; and chlorophyll &lt;em&gt;b&lt;/em&gt;) is strikingly similar to that of plants. Green algae also resemble plants because they store fixed carbon as starch and they possess cell walls composed of cellulose. Although the issue is contentious, most systematists continue to classify green algae separately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial30_fig19_30.jpg" title="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial30_fig20_30.jpg" title="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a tremendous amount of diversity within this kingdom. Chlorophytes occupy a remarkable array of habitats, including marine, freshwater and terrestrial environments. A number are seaweeds, most are freshwater algae, and some terrestrial chlorophytes (&lt;strong&gt;lichens&lt;/strong&gt;) live in a symbiotic association with fungi. The 7,000 species that comprise this kingdom range from unicellular to colonial to truly multicellular. Separate evolutionary events might have led to the evolution from single-celled green algae to colonial organisms (e.g., the beautiful &lt;em&gt;Volvox&lt;/em&gt;), to multinucleate single-celled seaweeds, and to multicellular seaweeds (e.g., &lt;em&gt;Ulva&lt;/em&gt;). The photos below show the diversity of this group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial30_fig21_30.jpg" title="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kingdom Chlorophyta also exhibits many forms of reproduction, and most species reproduce asexually and sexually. For example, &lt;em&gt;Spirogyra&lt;/em&gt; is composed of long filaments of cells that can break apart and divide to produce new individuals. &lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial30_fig22_30.jpg" title="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, bridges can form between different individuals, allowing the exchange of gametes. Like the brown and red algae, many green algae also display alternation of generations during their sexual cycles, switching between haploid and diploid forms. Note, unlike the brown alga &lt;em&gt;Laminaria&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Ulva&lt;/em&gt; alternates between haploid and diploid forms that are structurally similar. This is referred to as &lt;strong&gt;isomorphic&lt;/strong&gt; alternation of generations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="0" src="http://c.gigcount.com/wildfire/IMP/CXNID=2000002.0NXC/bT*xJmx*PTEzMTAyNDM2NjYwNTkmcHQ9MTMxMDI*MzY3NjUwMiZwPTIwNjQyMSZkPWIyMTQyOTA3Jmc9MiZvPTk2NjhhNGRlZDA4/NDRmNzlhYTY1ZTI4N2RlOTA2Y2E4Jm9mPTA=.gif" style="visibility:hidden;width:0px;height:0px;" width="0" /&gt;&lt;object height="480" width="640"&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2142907" /&gt;&lt;param name="wmode" value="transparent" /&gt;&lt;embed height="480" src="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2142907" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="640" wmode="transparent"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The protists are ecologically and economically significant organisms; they are responsible for a large portion of the Earth&amp;#39;s fixed carbon and for a number of plant and animal diseases, some of which have caused considerable devastation to mankind. Considering their small size, their diversity is astounding. The beginnings of multicellularity in early protists paved the way for even greater structural complexity and diversity in taxa such as plants, animals, and fungi. For more information on the systematics and taxonomy of protists (and all other life forms), the web site of the University of California-Berkeley&amp;#39;s Museum of Paleontology is an excellent resource, although their system of classification differs somewhat from the system used in this course.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Introduction and Goals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plants dominate the natural world and are the source of energy for the majority of other terrestrial organisms. Modern plants descended from an ancestral plant that lived in an aquatic environment. We will study the evolutionary history of the plant kingdom to better understand the selective forces that have shaped plants&amp;#39; development and led to the diversity of forms in existence today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First we&amp;#39;ll examine the similarities and differences between members of the kingdom Plantae and the red, brown, and green algae reviewed in the previous tutorial. Of the three classes of algae, green algae are the closest living relatives to modern land plants. Adaptations for the transition from an aquatic to a terrestrial habitat distinguish members of the plant kingdom, so these features will be discussed in detail. Plants have been evolving for at least 450 million years, and based on their major adaptive features, four major plant lineages (taxonomic groups) are currently recognized. This tutorial will introduce each of these groups. It will also describe the nonvascular plants, the most primitive of the plant lineages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the tutorials discussing plant evolution and diversity, a good strategy would be to understand the major characteristics of each group, which characteristics are unique or are common to each group, and how these characteristics reflect adaptations to different environmental conditions. By the end of this tutorial you should have a working understanding of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The origins of plant life and the major factors contributing to their evolution&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Plant features that are adaptive to the terrestrial environment&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The major plant lineages and features that are characteristic of each group&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The evolutionary relationships among the nonvascular plants, seedless vascular plants, nonflowering seed plants, and flowering seed plants&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The distinguishing characteristics of nonvascular plants and their life cycles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Plants Share a Common Ancestor With Green Algae&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modern land plants have much in common with the group of green algae called &lt;strong&gt;charophytes&lt;/strong&gt;, and charophytes are the closest relatives of the plant kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial31_Fig1.jpg" title="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The phylogenetic tree on the right depicts the evolutionary relationships between charophytes and plants. It is thought that the first true plants were derived from a charophyte. This means that the ancestor species of all modern plants was actually a green algae living in an aquatic environment. There are many lines of evidence (e.g., chemical, structural, and genetic data) for the close evolutionary relationship between charophytes and plants. Chlorophytes (green algae) have the same photosynthetic pigments found in other plants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chlorophyll a is common to other photosynthetic organisms, but chlorophyll b is shared only by green algae and plants. Characters such as a cell wall composed primarily of cellulose, storage of carbon in the form of starch, and formation of a cell plate at cytokinesis are not limited to green algae and plants; however, these shared characters provide further evidence of their relatedness. Molecular evolutionary analyses of RNA and DNA sequence data from green algae and plants also clearly place these two groups closely together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the similarities between charophytes and plants, plants are classified in a separate kingdom (Plantae). Charophytes are highly adapted to an aquatic environment, and the features that distinguish members of the plant kingdom from charophytes are their adaptations to a terrestrial environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Geologic Time Scale for Plant Evolution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to remember that ancestral plants had many more shared features with charophytes than those of modern plants. They would have been transitional between the green algae and the plants in existence today. The environment they occupied was most likely subject to periods of drying, such that they slowly evolved features that allowed them to exist in a terrestrial rather than aquatic environment. This theme of adaptation to environmental conditions, via natural selection, is very important in the study of plant evolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fossil plant remains that clearly show features of true plants date back to 475 million years ago. The fossil record provides small windows into the past, and it aids scientists in approximating what life forms existed during a certain period in time. Because it can take millions of years for evolutionary changes to become established and because it is more rare than common for fossilization to occur, scientists estimate that the earliest plants began to evolve prior to the first evidence of plants in the fossil record. In fact, some evidence indicates that land plants appeared 700 million years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Transition From Aquatic to Terrestrial Environments&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although it is not certain when plants first arose, it appears that they did so during a time when the Earth&amp;#39;s climate was changing. Likely, those areas where plants evolved was subject to periods of saturation and periods of drying, and characteristics that enabled some species to better survive during the dry periods evolved slowly. Adaptation to the drier conditions eventually enabled early plants to colonize the land. To fully appreciate the huge advantages that terrestrial migration had for plant development, it is necessary to understand the differences between aquatic and terrestrial environments with respect to requirements for plant growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Advantages of Terrestrial Migration: Increased Photosynthesis and Decreased Competition&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order for plants to photosynthesize and produce the proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates necessary for growth, they require light energy. Light energy received by organisms living beneath the water&amp;#39;s surface is greatly reduced. The blue and especially red wavelengths of light that are absorbed by photosynthetic pigments do not penetrate deep beyond the surface of the water; therefore, photosynthetic organisms living in an aquatic environment do not receive the full amount of light energy radiated from the sun. Alternatively, photosynthetic organisms growing on land do not face this problem. Photons emitted from the sun can directly strike light-absorbing surfaces and the full range of useful wavelengths are available for photosynthesis. In the aquatic environment, many large algae compete for sunlight (similar to the competition for sunlight in modern forests). For early plants beginning to migrate to terrestrial environments, there was no competition for access to light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to remember the fundamental role that plants play within an ecosystem. Plants and other autotrophs are the basis for supporting heterotrophic life. Prior to colonization of the land by plants, there was little basis for support of animal life. As mentioned above, the vast majority of life existed in the ocean, including herbivores that depended on algae for food. A great advantage to the terrestrial migration of early plants was the lack of herbivores on land. Compared to life in the ocean, the terrestrial environment provided free access to sunlight and freedom from damage by larger organisms that could crush or eat the developing plants. However, the conditions on land were not completely hospitable for early plants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Challenges to Terrestrial Occupation: Desiccation and Upright Growth&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The major challenge for early plants first migrating onto land was the lack of water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an aquatic environment, &lt;strong&gt;desiccation&lt;/strong&gt; is generally not a problem and there is no need for any protective covering to prevent water loss. Lacking any protection from the dry terrestrial environment, early plants likely became desiccated very quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ancestors of early plants were highly dependent on water, not only to maintain their moisture content but also for structural support. The buoyancy of water supports upright growth of giant marine seaweeds (e.g., kelp). Consider the seaweeds that are often found washed up on the beach. Although these algae are no longer alive, when held beneath the water their upright form is restored. In a terrestrial environment, the surrounding media is air rather than water. Air does not provide any support for upright growth. The transition to land required changes in structural features, and, as will be discussed later in this tutorial, adaptations for structural support are key features used in plant classification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Adaptive Features of Plants&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the course of their evolution, plants have adapted to a land-based existence. Because modern plants occupy numerous, very specialized, ecological niches (e.g., deserts, rainforests, and even aquatic environments), there are many more specific adaptations than those that will be covered in this tutorial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will focus on those adaptations that have allowed plants to overcome the challenges of a dry environment and the lack of support for upright growth. These adaptive features include: cuticles, stomata, vascular tissue, gametangia, and seeds. As each of these adaptive features is discussed, keep in mind the transition of early plants from an aquatic to a terrestrial environment and how each feature could enhance the success of plants on land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Waxy Cuticles and Stomata&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A major adaptation to the dry terrestrial environment is the waxy &lt;strong&gt;cuticle&lt;/strong&gt;. Cuticles, composed of &lt;strong&gt;wax&lt;/strong&gt;, are found on the surface of all above-ground parts of the plant. Waxes are a class of lipids (discussed in &lt;a href="https://online.science.psu.edu/biol110_sandbox_2381/node/8949"&gt;Carbon and Life&lt;/a&gt; under lipids) that, due to their chemical properties, are maintained as a solid, even at the highest temperatures found in extreme conditions (e.g., deserts). Like all lipids, waxes are hydrophobic and impermeable to water. Of course, plant roots are not covered by cuticle because they are the structures responsible for water uptake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The waxy cuticle covering the surface of the plant shoot is an effective barrier to desiccation because it prevents loss of water to the air. Not surprisingly, desert plants have a much thicker cuticle layer than plants growing in wet environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stomata&lt;/strong&gt; (introduced in &lt;a href="https://online.science.psu.edu/biol110_sandbox_2381/node/8924"&gt;Energy V: Photosynthesis [Calvin Cycle] Terms&lt;/a&gt;) are also an important adaptive feature to the terrestrial environment. Because the cuticle is impermeable, it is necessary for plants to have pores through which gasses can be exchanged with the environment. Remember, carbon dioxide is required for photosynthesis and oxygen is produced during this process. These gasses enter and exit the plant through the stomata.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Vascular Tissue&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vasculature describes a system of specialized cells found throughout the body of the plant. Vasculature has two functions. First, the specialized cells of &lt;strong&gt;vascular tissue&lt;/strong&gt; allow transport of water and nutrients throughout the plant. This adaptation enables water, absorbed by the roots of the plant, to reach the stem and leaves, and the sugars from photosynthesis, produced in the shoots, to be transported to the roots. Plants with vasculature are less dependent on a very moist environment to maintain hydration throughout the plant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second function of vasculature is structural support. Cells of the vascular tissue have secondarily reinforced cell walls that make the tissue rigid. The vascular tissue that runs throughout the plant body, circulating water and nutrients, also forms a &quot;skeleton&quot; that strengthens the roots, shoots, and leaves. Vascular tissue enables plants to grow upright (some to very great heights), while maintaining moisture levels in all parts of the plant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The evolution of vasculature was a major event in plant history. Plants with vascular tissue do not appear in the fossil record until approximately 400 million years ago, well after the origin of land plants. After this date there was an explosion of plant life, indicating that vascular tissue is a highly successful adaptation to life on land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Gametangia&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transition from an aquatic to a terrestrial environment was also marked by various adaptations related to plant reproduction. In the charophyte ancestor of modern plants, processes such as gamete production, fertilization, and development of the embryo were highly dependent on the aquatic environment. Gametes were dispersed by water currents and were maintained in a hydrated state until fertilization occurred. The zygote and growing embryo developed free from the parent organism because there was no threat of desiccation. The move to land required protection from desiccation of gametes and embryos, as well as a new means of gamete and embryo dispersal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The major adaptation of plants to the terrestrial environment (with respect to reproduction) was the production of gametes and the development of embryos within &lt;strong&gt;gametangia&lt;/strong&gt;. The gametangium (-ium, singular; -ia, plural) can be male or female, and is the site of gamete production. The female gametangium produces egg cells and the male gametangium produces sperm. A protective chamber, formed by a single layer of sterile cells, prevents the gametes from drying out by reducing or eliminating their exposure to air. Egg cells are maintained in the female gametangium, but the sperm must leave the male gametangium for fertilization to occur. Some groups of modern plants have retained the primitive characteristic of flagellated sperm and still are dependent on water for dispersal of male gametes; however, the majority of modern plants do not have motile sperm and have developed nonwater-based methods of dispersal (e.g., wind and insect pollination).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all plants, fertilization occurs within the female gametangium, where the zygote begins to develop into the embryo. Because all plants retain the developing embryo within the gametangium, they are referred to as &lt;strong&gt;embryophytes&lt;/strong&gt;. Protection of the growing embryo is especially important in the terrestrial environment because the waxy cuticles, stomatas, and vascular tissue present in mature plants are not well developed in the embryonic plant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Protection of the Developing Multicellular Embryo, and Seeds and Their Dispersal&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protection of the developing multicellular embryo varies among the different plant lineages. The most primitive group of plants retains the developing embryo through sexual maturity. The diploid embryo is completely dependent on the haploid gametophyte generation. This life cycle is typical of the nonvascular plants, and will be described in detail near the end of this tutorial. The more-derived plant lineages have further adapted to the terrestrial environment by producing specialized structures for protection and nutrition of the developing embryo. The embryo is enclosed in a seed, which is dispersed from the parent plant long before the embryo reaches maturity. In the derived plant lineages, the haploid gametophyte is greatly reduced because it no longer plays a dominant role in protecting the embryo; in these groups of plants, the haploid gametophyte has become completely dependent on the diploid generation. As you will learn in future tutorials discussing seed plants, seeds are a highly successful adaptation to the variable environmental conditions on land. Independent of the parent plant, the seed-enclosed embryo can withstand drying and temperature fluctuations, even the digestive tract of some animals, until conditions are suitable for germination and growth of the embryo to maturity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;object data="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2148680" height="480" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="640"&gt;&lt;param name="quality" value="high" /&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2148680" /&gt;&lt;param name="wmode" value="transparent" /&gt;&lt;embed height="480" hspace="10" quality="high" src="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2148680" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" vspace="10" width="640" wmode="transparent"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most recent adaptations to the terrestrial environment were the evolution of flowering plants and the production of fruit as a means for seed dispersal. Flowering plants produce their seeds within a fruit that provides a functional &quot;packaging&quot; around the seed(s). The fruit can be edible, such that the digested seeds are then deposited with the feces of the animal that consumed the fruit. Other fruits are suitable for transport on air currents, water currents, or on the fur of different animals. You will learn more about flowering seed plants (and their remarkable adaptations to life on land) in future tutorials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first evidence of seed plants in the fossil record occurs approximately 375 million years ago. Seed production enabled plants to reproduce more successfully because the embryos had a much better chance of surviving the dry terrestrial environment than did the embryos of more primitive plants that were still dependent on the parent plant body. Fruit production by flowering plants is a more specialized adaptation to life on land because it reflects not only the environment, but also the other life forms that exist there. Although the first flowering plants occur in the fossil record only 175 million years ago, the success of fruit production is marked by the huge radiation of flowering plants. Just think about the advantage to plants whose offspring could be widely dispersed and were protected (within the seed) until conditions were suitable for growth. Seed plants are so dominant in the world today that we have to remind ourselves that there are numerous plants in existence that do not produce seeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Plant Phylogeny: Lineages are Defined by Major Adaptive Features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The various adaptations to the terrestrial environment (e.g., waxy cuticles, stomata, vasculature, gametangia, seeds, and fruit) have evolved slowly during the 475 million-year history of plants. With these adaptations in mind, we will move on to a discussion of plant phylogeny and begin our review of the major characteristics of each of the plant lineages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial31_Fig1_0.jpg" title="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The relationships indicated by the branching pattern of the phylogenetic tree shown on the right reflect the current character states and the evolutionary history of these groups of plants. The base of each of the plant lineages is defined by a significant adaptation to life on land (e.g., the development of vascular tissue, production of seeds, and flowering). As mentioned earlier, there are many more specialized adaptations to the terrestrial environment found among modern plants; however, these adaptations are found in only a small group of plants. The major adaptations that define each lineage are characteristic of hundreds and thousands of species of plants. The ancestral forms of these plants and those in which the adaptive features first evolved are no longer living, but their remains are present in the fossil record and provide a basis for dating the origin of each lineage. Continuous adaptations to an ever-changing environment over the history of plant life has led to the diversity of species currently in existence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we begin to discuss each of the plant lineages, it is important to understand the phylogenetic relationships among them. According to this figure, are nonvascular plants &quot;older&quot; than nonflowering seed plants? The correct way to interpret a phylogenetic tree is to read which groups are more closely related to one another, and which groups are more primitive or more highly diverged. Nonvascular plants are not &quot;older&quot; than nonflowering seed plants, but they possess a greater number of primitive character states than do nonflowering seed plants. Also, the origin of the nonflowering seed plant lineage occurred later in time than the origin of nonvascular plants, but this does not mean that currently living nonvascular plants are any older than currently living nonflowering seed plants. Flowering seed plants are the most derived lineage of plants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Introduction to the Major Taxonomic Groups of Plants&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that you have a working knowledge of the major adaptations present throughout the plant kingdom and understand the evolutionary relationships among them, you will be introduced to the four lineages: (1) nonvascular plants, (2) seedless vascular plants (3) nonflowering seed plants, and (4) flowering seed plants. Nonvascular plant characteristics will be examined in this tutorial in some detail. Upcoming tutorials will focus on the other groups. Always keep in mind how the adaptations found in each lineage of plants reflect the environmental conditions in which each lineage developed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Nonvascular Plants&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the name of this group indicates, plants in this lineage do not have vascular tissue (or if present, it is very reduced). Because they lack substantial vasculature, plants in this lineage are generally small in size, lack significant structural support, grow close to the ground in moist areas, and lack significant water-conducting cells. Plants first evolved in environments that were transitional between the land and the sea, and although modern nonvascular plants are dependent on water to complete their life cycles, they are able to withstand long periods of desiccation. Nonvascular plants include mosses, liverworts, and hornworts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Seedless Vascular Plants&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial31_Fig2.jpg" title="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seedless vascular plants have a waxy cuticle, stomata, and well-developed vascular tissue. Their vasculature allows them to grow to larger sizes than the nonvascular plants, but they still generally occupy moist habitats. This lineage is more highly derived from the common ancestor of all plants than are the nonvascular plants, however, they do not produce seeds. Although the developing diploid embryo is dependent on the haploid gametophyte for survival (like mosses), the diploid sporophyte is more conspicuous and is the prominent generation of seedless vascular plants. Phylogenetically, seedless vascular plants are basal to the seed plants. The seedless vascular plants include species such as ferns and horsetails shown in the images below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial31_Fig3.jpg" title="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Vascular Plants With Seeds (Nonflowering Seed Plants)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial31_Fig4_0.jpg" style="width: 600px; height: 400px;" title="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vascular plants with seeds belong to one of two groups: those with flowers, and those without flowers. Those without flowers are also known as gymnosperms, which means &quot;naked seed&quot; and refers to the lack of flowers and fruits in all members of this lineage (as compared to the more highly derived lineage with flowers). The ancestor of modern nonflowering seed plants evolved once plants were already well established on land. Adaptations of a well-developed vasculature and seeds indicate a strictly land-based existence. With the production of seeds, the gametophyte generation is highly reduced in this lineage and the sporophyte generation is most prominent. Nonflowering seed plants include conifers (e.g., pine, hemlock, spruce, and fir trees) and cycads. A cyclad is shown below on the left and a pine is shown on the right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial31_Fig5.jpg" title="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Flowering Vascular Plants With Seeds&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;Flowering vascular plants are also known as angiosperms. Although this group of plants evolved more recently than nonvascular plants, seedless vascular plants and nonflowering seed plants, it includes the greatest number of species currently in existence. The great success of this group is due to their highly evolved and specialized methods for gamete dispersal (many species have insect or other animal pollinators) and seed dispersal (various types of fruits aid in the dispersal and successful germination of their seeds). The adaptations found in this taxonomic group are linked to the great diversity of animal life existing in the terrestrial environment. All of the agricultural crops we depend on for food, the fiberous plants we depend on for clothing, and the plants we grow to beautify our surroundings are from this lineage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial31_Fig6.jpg" title="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="0" src="http://c.gigcount.com/wildfire/IMP/CXNID=2000002.0NXC/bT*xJmx*PTEzMTA3NDkzMzYzMDMmcHQ9MTMxMDc*OTMzODU1MSZwPTIwNjQyMSZkPWIyMTQ4Njg*Jmc9MiZvPTk2NjhhNGRlZDA4/NDRmNzlhYTY1ZTI4N2RlOTA2Y2E4Jm9mPTA=.gif" style="visibility: hidden; width: 0px; height: 0px;" width="0" /&gt;&lt;object data="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2148684" height="480" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="640"&gt;&lt;param name="quality" value="high" /&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2148684" /&gt;&lt;param name="wmode" value="transparent" /&gt;&lt;embed height="480" hspace="10" quality="high" src="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2148684" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" vspace="10" width="640" wmode="transparent"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Nonvascular Seedless Plants&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will discuss the various features of nonvascular plants, using mosses as an example. As we review the general characteristics of this group, remember, the liverworts and hornworts also belong to this group&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Nonvascular Plants: Environment and Morphology&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of all the plant lineages, nonvascular plants are the most basal group. This means that throughout the millions of years of plant evolution, this group has retained more primitive characteristics than any of the other plant lineages. They are less derived than seedless vascular plants and seed plants, but this group of plants is highly successful in the environments they inhabit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As one walks through a wooded area, they are highly likely to find mosses growing on rocks, rotting wood, trees, or on the ground. Nonvascular plants are generally small and do not extend much more than a few inches above the surface they are growing on. Their appearance can best be described as a &quot;carpet of green.&quot; The plant body that is most obvious is actually the gametophyte generation, which is haploid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nonvascular plants typically grow in moist environments. Their lack of vascular tissue requires them to maintain close contact with water to prevent desiccation. They do not have true roots, true stems, or true leaves (which are distinguished by the organization of vascular tissue). &lt;strong&gt;Rhizoids&lt;/strong&gt; are the root-like structures that function to anchor them to the surface they are growing on, however, they are not capable of water uptake. Water is absorbed throughout the &quot;leafy&quot; plant body of the gametophyte. They also require a moist environment for successful fertilization. They do not produce pollen grains, hence this group of plants has retained the primitive condition of a flagellated sperm. The male gametes are motile in water and must be released into a moist environment so that the sperm can swim to the female gametangium (where the egg cells are located).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Alternation of Generations: The Moss Life Cycle&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternation of generations (discussed&amp;nbsp; in &lt;a href="https://online.science.psu.edu/biol110_sandbox_2381/node/8930"&gt;Protists II&lt;/a&gt;) is an important concept in the study of plant evolution. During the life cycle of plants, generations alternate between the gametophyte (which produces gametes) and the sporophyte (which produces spores). As mentioned above, the most conspicuous (or prominent) form of all nonvascular plants is the haploid gametophyte generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial31_Fig7.jpg" title="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To better understand alternation of generations in nonvascular plants, study this figure on the right. It depicts the life cycle of a &lt;strong&gt;heterosporous&lt;/strong&gt; moss and helps to distinguish the haploid and diploid stages.&amp;nbsp; Heterospory refers to the production of distinct male and female gametophytes from different spore types.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note the prominent form of the moss, the gametophyte, which is haploid (1n). This is the plant body that is most often observed. In the figure there are separate male and female gametophytes; however, the gametophyte can also be bisexual (male and female gametangia are located on the same plant body). In step 1, the gametophyte is the generation that produces gametes; sperm are produced in the male gametangium, the &lt;strong&gt;antheridium&lt;/strong&gt; (plural, antheridia), and eggs are produced in the female gametangium, the &lt;strong&gt;archegonium&lt;/strong&gt; (plural, archegonia). In step 2, the motile sperm has reached the egg, which is retained in the archegonium and fertilization takes place. (Remember, water is required for fertilization because the flagellated sperm must swim to the egg.) In step 3, the diploid (2n) zygote undergoes mitosis and begins to develop into the embryo (also 2n). In step 4, the embryo matures into the sporophyte, the diploid (2n) plant body. The sporophyte is the small, brown, stalked structure that one sometimes sees held above the main body of the moss. In step 5, meiosis takes place in the sporangium of the mature sporophyte and haploid spores are produced. In steps 6 and 7, the haploid spores are dispersed and each spore undergoes mitotic cell division to create a haploid multicellular gametophyte. The prominent haploid gametophyte is then ready to produce gametes (back to step 1).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An important feature of the moss life cycle is that the developing embryo is retained on the gametophyte plant body. This is an adaptation to the terrestrial environment because the embryo is protected from desiccation throughout its development into the sporophyte. (Remember the description of plants as embryophytes?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If one thinks about haploid and diploid stages in terms of the animal life cycle, it will be difficult to make sense of the plant life cycle. As noted above, the plant life cycle includes alternation of generations, with a multicellular haploid stage. Review again, step 5 of the life cycle (where meiosis takes place). Note that meiosis does not occur again when gametes are produced. Once you recognize these differences, you should begin to feel more comfortable thinking about the plant life cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="0" src="http://c.gigcount.com/wildfire/IMP/CXNID=2000002.0NXC/bT*xJmx*PTEzMTA3NDkyMTAxMDQmcHQ9MTMxMDc*OTI3ODcwNiZwPTIwNjQyMSZkPWIyMTQ4NjkzJmc9MiZvPTk2NjhhNGRlZDA4/NDRmNzlhYTY1ZTI4N2RlOTA2Y2E4Jm9mPTA=.gif" style="visibility: hidden; width: 0px; height: 0px;" width="0" /&gt;&lt;object data="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2148693" height="480" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="640"&gt;&lt;param name="quality" value="high" /&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2148693" /&gt;&lt;param name="wmode" value="transparent" /&gt;&lt;embed height="480" hspace="10" quality="high" src="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2148693" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" vspace="10" width="640" wmode="transparent"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The diversity of plants existing today is the result of 450-700 million years of evolution and adaptation to the terrestrial environment. The common ancestor of all plants is thought to be very similar to species in the group of green algae known as the charophytes. Charophytes are similar to modern plants. Both have cellulosic cell walls, cell plates during cytokinesis, carbon storage in the form of starch, possession of chlorophyll b as an accessory pigment, and similar RNA and DNA sequences for particular genes. Charophytes are aquatic organisms, and it is highly likely that the earliest plants occupied transitional environments between the sea and the land. The transition to the terrestrial environment was advantageous for plants because there was direct access to sunlight and little to no herbivore activity. Early plants were ill-equipped for life out of the water, and desiccation was a major challenge to a land-based existence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adaptations to the terrestrial environment enabled generation after generation of plants to successfully exist out of the water. The waxy cuticle and stomata were effective in reducing water loss and preventing desiccation. Vascular tissue further reduced the problem of desiccation because it allowed transport of water and nutrients throughout the plant. Upright growth for improved access to sunlight was also an advantage conferred by vascular tissue because it also functions in internal support of the plant body. Protection of gametes and developing embryos was accomplished by evolution of the jacketed gametangia, and later, the evolution of seeds. More recently in plant history, adaptive features have been influenced by other organisms in the terrestrial environment; some plants produce specialized flower structures and fruits that attract insects and other animals that aid in pollination and seed dispersal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of the plants that are currently in existence are highly evolved, however, different taxonomic groups are defined based on the adaptive features that have or have not evolved. The most basal group is the nonvascular plants. They have retained many of the primitive characteristics that are also found in charophytes. Seedless vascular plants are more derived than nonvascular plants and are defined by their lack of seed production and presence of vascular tissue. The more derived lineages, nonflowering seed plants and flowering seed plants, both produce seeds, but only the flowering seed plants produce flowers and fruits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nonvascular plants (including mosses, liverworts and hornworts) are highly successful and can be found the world over. They are resistant to desiccation, but prefer a moist environment due to their lack of vascular tissue and motile gametes. Nonvascular plants, like other plants, are embryophytes, and their life cycles are based on alternation of generations. The prominent generation of nonvascular plants is the multicellular haploid gametophyte. The diploid sporophyte generation is completely dependent on the gametophyte for its survival. In the more derived plant lineages, the gametophyte is greatly reduced. Life cycles and the major characteristics of the seedless vascular plants, nonflowering seed plants, and flowering seed plants will be discussed in future tutorials for comparison with the more primitive nonvascular plants.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <body>&lt;h1&gt;Terms&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should have a working knowledge of the following terms:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
	&lt;tbody&gt;
		&lt;tr&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;
				&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;fern&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Introduction and Goals&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By now you should have a good understanding of the advantages and challenges to plants living on land. You should also know that the nonvascular plants do not have vascular tissue or seeds, however, they do have a waxy cuticle, stomata, and protected embryo. The last tutorial introduced you to the seedless vascular plants, which in addition to a waxy cuticle and stomata, have a well-developed vasculature. Now we will examine the function of vascular tissue in the seedless vascular plants. By the end of this tutorial you should have a working understanding of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The evolution of seedless vascular plants&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The importance of vascular tissue&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The advantages of a dominant sporophyte&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The life cycle of seedless vascular plants&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The three groups (lycophytes, sphenophytes, and pterophytes) of seedless plants&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Evolution of Vascular Plants&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial32_Fig1.jpg" title="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first fossil record of a vascular plant is from the Silurian period, about 420 million years ago. The drawing on the right depicts a fossil of &lt;em&gt;Cooksonia&lt;/em&gt;. There are many well-preserved fossils, some of which clearly show the vasculature that had begun to form, even in this early plant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice the bulbous projections at the tips of some of the stems. These are thought to have been the spore-producing structures; therefore, this is considered the sporophytic generation of the plant. This is important because it shows that the transition to a more prominent sporophyte had already occurred by this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At 5 cm, &lt;em&gt;Cooksonia&lt;/em&gt; had grown much taller than the land plants that preceded it. This was due to the vasculature that provided the structural support necessary to grow on land. Seedless vascular plants went on to dominate the land through the Carboniferous period, about 300 million years ago. At that time, they grew to heights of 15 meters or more. The period is named Carboniferous because it was characterized by swamps filled with tree ferns and other seedless vascular plants that subsequently became the coal that is mined today. The seedless vascular plants now in existence are much smaller, and they are very prevalent in the forests of Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Vascular Tissue&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vascular tissue is the characteristic that distinguishes the seedless vascular plants from those plants that preceded them. While protected gametes allowed plants to move onto land, it was vascular tissue that allowed plants to dominate the landscape. Vasculature provides a means for fluid transport and structural support for the body of the plant. Vascular tissue consists of &lt;strong&gt;xylem&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;phloem&lt;/strong&gt;. Xylem is primarily the vasculature where water and minerals travel from the roots up the stems to the various parts of the plant. Phloem transports the sugars made during photosynthesis down to the roots for energy. Thus, there is a net movement of water up and nutrients down. These two types of vessels differ structurally and functionally. The xylem is made of nonliving cells that tend to be more fortified for plant strength. The phloem consists of living cells that are modified to allow the flow of fluids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vascular tissue gives support to plants. &lt;strong&gt;Lignin&lt;/strong&gt; is embedded in plant cell walls between the cellulose matrix, and it is a very stable molecule that does not break down easily. We are able to use wood in construction because of the strength that lignin provides. Lignin plays the same role in plants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="0" src="http://c.gigcount.com/wildfire/IMP/CXNID=2000002.0NXC/bT*xJmx*PTEzMTA3NTE1NDYyODcmcHQ9MTMxMDc1MTU*ODEyNiZwPTIwNjQyMSZkPWIyMTQ4NzA2Jmc9MiZvPTk2NjhhNGRlZDA4/NDRmNzlhYTY1ZTI4N2RlOTA2Y2E4Jm9mPTA=.gif" style="visibility: hidden; width: 0px; height: 0px;" width="0" /&gt;&lt;object data="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2148706" height="480" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="640"&gt;&lt;param name="quality" value="high" /&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2148706" /&gt;&lt;param name="wmode" value="transparent" /&gt;&lt;embed height="480" hspace="10" quality="high" src="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2148706" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" vspace="10" width="640" wmode="transparent"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Spores&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like all plants, seedless vascular plants have a gametophytic generation and a sporophytic generation. Recall, the sporophytic generation is the diploid part of the life cycle and, via meiosis, haploid spores are produced. Remember from the last tutorial, the moss life cycle is characterized by two types of haploid spores, male and female. We call this condition &lt;strong&gt;heterosporous&lt;/strong&gt; (&quot;hetero&quot; meaning different and &quot;sporous&quot; referring to the spores). In this case, the sporophyte produces (via meiosis) &lt;strong&gt;megaspores&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;microspores&lt;/strong&gt;. Haploid megaspores develop into haploid female gametophytes, which then produce eggs. Likewise, haploid microspores develop into male gametophytes, which then produce sperm. Haploid gametes then join to form sporophytes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In seedless vascular plants, the &lt;strong&gt;homosporous&lt;/strong&gt; condition (&quot;homo&quot; meaning same) result in a single type of spore that develops into bisexual gametophytes. The fern life cycle figure depicts this condition. Bisexual gametophytes can produce both male and female gametes (sperm and eggs). Note, sperm and eggs are still separate and must join during fertilization, just as in the heterosporous condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Life Cycle&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial32_Fig2.jpg" title="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When one compares the life cycle of a moss (a nonvascular plant; below, left) to that of a fern (a seedless vascular plant; below, right), the most notable difference is the relative sizes of the sporophyte and gametophyte. In mosses the haploid gametophyte is the dominant generation, whereas in ferns the diploid sporophyte is the dominant generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What was life like when the early plants were colonizing land? Remember, one of the advantages of moving onto land was the new abundance of light energy that plants could access. However, light can damage DNA and induce mutations. Recall, most mutations are deleterious, and haploid organisms that suffer a lethal mutation have no wild-type copy to &quot;rescue&quot; them from lethal mutations. For this reason, the haploid stage is more sensitive to genetic insult than is the diploid stage. Likely, the transition from a prominent haploid stage to a prominent diploid stage was adaptive for the relatively high mutation rate suffered by terrestrial plants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial32_Fig3.jpg" title="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take another look at the moss and fern life cycles. Both have flagellated sperm. This means that they are both dependent on water for fertilization. Mosses are already very small and low to the moist ground, but ferns have vascular tissue and are much taller. This could be another reason for the dominance of the sporophyte. In the case of ferns, the gametophyte is much smaller and lower to the ground, where moisture is more available for fertilization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other similarity between mosses and ferns is that both have antheridia and archegonia. Recall from tutorial 31, these structures are the specialized gametophytic tissue where gametes are produced. The archegonium is also where the egg is fertilized once the sperm from the antheridium swims through water to reach it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Classification of Seedless Vascular Plants&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The seedless vascular plants can be divided into three groups: &lt;strong&gt;Lycophyta&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;strong&gt;lycophytes&lt;/strong&gt;), &lt;strong&gt;Sphenophyta&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;strong&gt;horsetails&lt;/strong&gt;), and &lt;strong&gt;Pterophyta&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;strong&gt;ferns&lt;/strong&gt;). Lycophytes appeared during the Devonian period but split into two lines during the Carboniferous period. One line became the huge extinct trees that thrived some 300 million years ago, and a good portion of the carbon they fixed was fossilized and is now burned as coal. The other line of lycophytes are small nonwoody plants. These extant lycophtes are usually found in either temperate forest floors or tropical areas. One species, &lt;em&gt;Lycopodium&lt;/em&gt;, can be found in the forests around Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except for one existing species (&lt;em&gt;Equisetum&lt;/em&gt;), the group whose members are commonly called horsetails is also extinct. &lt;em&gt;Equisetum&lt;/em&gt; occurs in damp locations and is an example of a homosporous plant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="0" src="http://c.gigcount.com/wildfire/IMP/CXNID=2000002.0NXC/bT*xJmx*PTEzMTA3NTE2Mjg4MDAmcHQ9MTMxMDc1MTYzMDk1NCZwPTIwNjQyMSZkPWIyMTQ4NzE*Jmc9MiZvPTk2NjhhNGRlZDA4/NDRmNzlhYTY1ZTI4N2RlOTA2Y2E4Jm9mPTA=.gif" style="visibility: hidden; width: 0px; height: 0px;" width="0" /&gt;&lt;object data="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2148714" height="480" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="640"&gt;&lt;param name="quality" value="high" /&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2148714" /&gt;&lt;param name="wmode" value="transparent" /&gt;&lt;embed height="480" hspace="10" quality="high" src="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2148714" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" vspace="10" width="640" wmode="transparent"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third group of seedless vascular plants is probably the most familiar. These are the ferns or pterophytes. Most of us have seen ferns growing on a forest floor or as cut fronds in a flower arrangement. There are about 12,000 species of ferns in existence today, and they are found in tropical and temperate regions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the vasculature of seedless vascular plants has allowed them to grow to larger sizes than nonvascular plants, they also generally occupy moist habitats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Summary&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tutorial examined seedless vascular plants. In particular, we examined the significance of their vascular tissue. Vasculature provides plants with a means to transport materials and aids upright growth in the terrestrial environment. Ferns were used as a representative of seedless vascular plants to examine their life cycle. We learned that the sporophyte is the dominant generation and that this diploid condition can provide plants with an advantage against the damaging effects of the sun. This sporophyte generation begins its life in the protection of the archegonium.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

				&lt;/ul&gt;
			&lt;/td&gt;
		&lt;/tr&gt;
	&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Introduction and Goals&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nonvascular plants and seedless vascular plants were presented in the last two tutorials. The next two tutorials will present the two categories of seed plants, also known as the gymnosperms and angiosperms. This tutorial will focus on the evolution of seed plants and, in particular, nonflowering seed plants. By the end of this tutorial you should have a basic working understanding of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Alternation of generations in seed plants&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The importance of seeds and pollen to land plants&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The four divisions of nonflowering seed plants (gymnosperms)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The life cycle of nonflowering seed plants&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Seed Plants: Sporophytes More Prominent, Gametophytes More Reduced&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial33_Fig1.jpg" title="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By now you should be familiar with the alternation of generations present in all plants, and that the gametophyte (1n) and the sporophyte (2n) exist in multicellular forms. The gametophyte is the dominant form in nonvascular plants. In fact, the sporophyte is smaller and is nourished by the gametophyte as it develops. In seedless vascular plants and seed plants the sporophyte is the dominant form. This first variation in the alternation of generations is clearly depicted in this figure on the right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second variation in the alternation of generations came about with the appearance of vascular tissue. The seedless vascular plants are most commonly represented by the ferns. For example, the ferns that are observed growing in the forest and the fern fronds (leaves) that are a part of floral arrangements are sporophytes (2n). The spores that are released from the undersides of fern fronds grow into gametophytes (1n), which exist independently from the sporophyte. Note, the sporophyte is much larger than the gametophyte (depicted above).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seed plants represent the third variation of alternation of generations. Like the ferns, the sporophyte is the prominent generation. Unlike the ferns, however, seed plants have gametophytes that are surrounded by &lt;strong&gt;sporophytic tissue&lt;/strong&gt;. This sporophytic tissue nourishes the gametophyte; therefore, the gametophyte does not live independently from the sporophyte and is even more reduced in size. (In Figure 1 above, the line to the gametophyte of the seed plant points to a structure composed of only eight cells.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Dispersal Mechanisms: Haploid Spores Versus Diploid Seeds&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to having more reduced gametophytes, seed plants use a different method to disperse their offspring than seedless vascular plants. A seedless vascular plant (e.g., a fern) releases spores into its environment. If conditions are suitable, the spore grows into a mature gametophytic generation. If conditions are harsh, the spore will persist without germinating and will lie dormant until favorable conditions present themselves. Many seeds are also known for lying dormant until conditions are optimal for germination and growth. For example, some pine seeds actually require the heat of a fire to trigger germination. This is adaptive because just after a fire the seedling can grow quickly without competition from taller trees. Therefore, spores and seeds are similar because they both are resistant to harsh conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, spores and seeds differ in their structure and composition. Spores are unicellular, haploid, and contain little storage tissue. They are also very small and relatively simple. Seeds are multicellular, larger, and can contain a large amount of storage material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial33_Fig2.jpg" title="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another major difference between the spores of seedless plants and seeds is that the haploid spores of seedless plants are released by the parent and they develop independently, whereas seeds develop within the parental sporophytic tissue. Seed plants have female spores (megaspores) and male spores (microspores). The male microspore of a seed plant produces sperm within &lt;strong&gt;pollen&lt;/strong&gt;, which are transported to the female megaspore. Seed plants have a haploid megaspore that is contained within a fleshy solid mass contained within an &lt;strong&gt;ovule&lt;/strong&gt;. A &lt;strong&gt;seed&lt;/strong&gt; is a fertilized mature ovule. There are also tissues in the ovule (integuments) that become the &lt;strong&gt;seed coat&lt;/strong&gt;. The image on the right shows the location of these structures in a simple flower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, while seedless vascular plants disperse their offspring via haploid spores, seed plants disperse their offspring via diploid seeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Importance of Pollen&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial33_Fig3.jpg" title="" /&gt; &lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial33_Fig4.jpg" title="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sperm from seedless plants have flagella that propel them through water to reach the egg cell. This mechanism works well for plants in moist environments, however, these plants have a difficult time reproducing in drier environments. The pollen grain is an important adaptation to dry environments. Pollen is a tough structure that contains the precursor to sperm cells. The tough outer coat of the pollen grain is able to survive very harsh conditions, therefore, it can protect the cells for years. When the pollen grain finally lands on the female structure of a plant, it germinates and sperm cells travel to the egg cell through a &lt;strong&gt;pollen tube&lt;/strong&gt;. Thus, the male gamete is protected (rather than open to the environment, as in seedless plants). This adaptation allows seed plants to live in such dry and harsh conditions as deserts. Note the differences in the life cycles shown below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Nonflowering Seed Plants&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nonflowering seed plants (sometimes called &lt;strong&gt;gymnosperms&lt;/strong&gt;) probably arose from a fern relative, appropriately named a progymnosperm, sometime between 409-363 million years ago. The nonflowering seed plants had largely taken over as the predominant land plants about 225 million years ago. They were the primary vegetation for dinosaurs. Currently, the nonflowering seed plants are comprised of four major groups: cycads, ginkgos, gnetophytes, and conifers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nonflowering seed plants are able to grow larger than seedless vascular plants because of their woody stems. The vascular tissue in most members is highly lignified, which adds strength to their cell walls. The strengthened wood allows them to achieve great heights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The members of this group are very diverse, however, they share one distinctive feature; they all have &quot;naked&quot; seeds. This means that they lack &lt;strong&gt;ovaries&lt;/strong&gt;. As you will learn, nonflowering seed plants and flowering seed plants have ovules in which their seeds develop. However, flowering seed plant ovules are contained within an ovary, whereas nonflowering seed plant ovules are not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Cycads&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial33_Fig5.jpg" title="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cycads&lt;/strong&gt; are slow-growing and long-lived &lt;strong&gt;perennials&lt;/strong&gt;. (They live and reproduce year after year.) They are considered woody, even though their wood does not look like that of a pine or oak tree. The leaves of cycads are large and appear feather-like, much like those of palm leaves. These leaves are arranged spirally at the top of the stem. Cycads are &lt;strong&gt;dioecious&lt;/strong&gt; plants; that is, their male and female reproductive structures reside on separate plants. One feature retained in cycads is motile sperm. Remember, nonvascular plants and seedless vascular plants have sperm equipped with flagella for motility. However, like all nonflowering seed plants, the cycads have &quot;naked&quot; seeds which are visible in the image at the right (i.e., note the red seeds spilling out to the left).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Ginkgos&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial33_Fig6.jpg" title="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is only one extant species of ginkgo, appropriately named &lt;em&gt;Ginkgo biloba&lt;/em&gt;. The genus name comes from the Chinese word meaning &quot;silver apricot&quot; (gin=silver, kyo=apricot). The species name is Latin for &quot;double leaf&quot; (bi=double, loba=leaf). The leaves are uniquely fan-shaped, with a split in the middle that makes them appear to have two lobes (image on right).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like cycads, &lt;strong&gt;ginkgos&lt;/strong&gt; are dioecious and have motile sperm. Due to their broad leaves, ginkgos are often mistaken for a flowering seed plant. However, the pattern of veins (dichotomous venation) in the leaves is unlike any found in flowering seed plants. Look closely and you will see that each vein splits in two as it passes across the leaf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most common place in America to find a ginkgo tree is along the sidewalk. They are frequently used to add color and shade to urban settings. The ginkgo tree is particularly resistant to disease, insects, and air pollution. In addition, the leaves turn a beautiful yellow in autumn, just before they fall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Gnetophytes&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial33_Fig7.jpg" title="" /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are three genera of &lt;strong&gt;gnetophytes&lt;/strong&gt;: Weltwitschia, Ephedra, and Gnetum (examples of each are shown in the images below). These are probably the least familiar gymnosperms, however, they serve an important role in understanding the evolution of angiosperms. Although the precise relationships are not known, it is generally accepted that the gnetophytes are more closely related to angiosperms than any other nonflowering plants because they are the only gymnosperms to undergo a process known as &lt;strong&gt;double fertilization&lt;/strong&gt;. In double fertilization, two sperm cells enter the ovule; one fertilizes the egg and the other fertilizes another cell within the ovary.&lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial33_Fig8.jpg" title="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial33_Fig9.jpg" title="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="0" src="http://c.gigcount.com/wildfire/IMP/CXNID=2000002.0NXC/bT*xJmx*PTEzMTA3NTUwMDA3ODgmcHQ9MTMxMDc1NTAwNDEzMiZwPTIwNjQyMSZkPWIyMTQ5MzE3Jmc9MiZvPTk2NjhhNGRlZDA4/NDRmNzlhYTY1ZTI4N2RlOTA2Y2E4Jm9mPTA=.gif" style="visibility: hidden; width: 0px; height: 0px;" width="0" /&gt;&lt;object data="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2149317" height="480" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="640"&gt;&lt;param name="quality" value="high" /&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2149317" /&gt;&lt;param name="wmode" value="transparent" /&gt;&lt;embed height="480" hspace="10" quality="high" src="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2149317" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" vspace="10" width="640" wmode="transparent"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Conifers&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pine trees, firs, spruces, larches, yews, junipers, cedars, cypresses, and redwoods are all conifers. Most of these are evergreens, however, there are a few &lt;strong&gt;deciduous&lt;/strong&gt; (trees that drop their leaves each fall) conifers (e.g., the cypress trees in the Florida everglades). The name &lt;strong&gt;conifer&lt;/strong&gt; comes from the Latin word meaning cone bearing. Conifers can be either &lt;strong&gt;monoecious&lt;/strong&gt; or dioecious. That is, their male and female reproductive structures reside on the same or different plants, respectively, but unlike other nonflowering seed plants, their sperm are not flagellated. They are delivered directly via the pollen tube.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conifers date back to the Mesozoic period. Unlike the other tropical nonflowering seed plants, most conifers are found in the forested parts of the Northern Hemisphere. They are by far the most economically and ecologically important members of the group. You probably are familiar with the 2X4&amp;#39;s used in construction. These boards, as well as many others, are made from pine trees. The wood of pine trees is softer than that of flowering seed plant trees, therefore, it is easier to hammer nails into this wood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The Nonflowering Seed Plant Life Cycle&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial33_fig10.jpg" title="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will discuss the life cycle of nonflowering seed plants, using pines as an example (shown here on the right). The male cones produce haploid pollen grains by meiosis. The pollen grains are immature &lt;strong&gt;microgametophytes&lt;/strong&gt; (male gametophytes). The female cones have scales that each contain two ovules. Each ovule has one opening called the &lt;strong&gt;micropyle&lt;/strong&gt;. When the ovule is ready to accept pollen, it secretes a liquid to which the pollen grain can adhere. As the liquid dries, the pollen is pulled into the ovule through the micropyle. At this point, a megaspore within the ovule goes through meiosis to produce four haploid cells. Only one cell survives, growing and dividing to produce the immature &lt;strong&gt;megagametophyte&lt;/strong&gt; (female gametophyte). Several eggs can develop within the megagametophyte.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the eggs are developing, two sperm cells are developing within the pollen grain. A third cell in the pollen grain begins to grow as the pollen tube moves toward the megagametophyte. Once the pollen tube reaches the megagametophyte, the sperm cells fertilize the egg cells. Note that pollination occurred when the pollen grain reached the ovule but fertilization did not occur until the sperm reached the egg. In most cases, fertilization does not happen until at least one year after pollination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="0" src="http://c.gigcount.com/wildfire/IMP/CXNID=2000002.0NXC/bT*xJmx*PTEzMTA3NTUwNzk1MDQmcHQ9MTMxMDc1NTA4MTYxOCZwPTIwNjQyMSZkPWIyMTQ5MzIzJmc9MiZvPTk2NjhhNGRlZDA4/NDRmNzlhYTY1ZTI4N2RlOTA2Y2E4Jm9mPTA=.gif" style="visibility: hidden; width: 0px; height: 0px;" width="0" /&gt;&lt;object data="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2149323" height="480" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="640"&gt;&lt;param name="quality" value="high" /&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2149323" /&gt;&lt;param name="wmode" value="transparent" /&gt;&lt;embed height="480" hspace="10" quality="high" src="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2149323" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" vspace="10" width="640" wmode="transparent"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only one fertilized egg will survive and develop into an embryo. The embryo is diploid, therefore, it becomes the sporophyte of the next generation. In seedless plants the fertilization and development of the next-generation sporophyte takes place separate from the first-generation sporophyte. However, notice that the female gametophyte remained within the parental sporophytic tissue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The embryo is made up of a rudimentary root and several embryonic leaves. The seed consists of three types of tissue: the new generation sporophyte or diploid embryo; the haploid female gametophytic tissue that stores nutrients; and the parent sporophytic tissues of the seed coat. The processes of gamete formation, pollination, fertilization, and germination are often very slow, and the life cycle can take two to three years from beginning to end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Summary&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tutorial examined the nonflowering seed plants (sometimes referred to as gymnosperms) First, we considered the alternation of generations. Then, we learned the importance of pollen and seeds in the development of land plants. We explored the amazing diversity of extant members of this group, as well as their evolutionary past. By looking at the life cycle of a pine, we compared and contrasted the life cycles of seedless plants and nonflowering seed plants.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

				&lt;/ul&gt;
			&lt;/td&gt;
		&lt;/tr&gt;
	&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Introduction and Goals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tutorial will examine the second group of seed plants, the flowering seed plants (sometimes referred to as &lt;strong&gt;angiosperms&lt;/strong&gt;). In particular, we will look at their life cycle and how it relates to their flowers and seeds. The various parts of these plants and their adaptations will also be discussed. By the end of this tutorial you should have a basic working understanding of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The anatomy of a flower&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The anatomy of a seed&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The life cycle of flowering seed plants&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Plant growth&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Adaptations of roots, stems, and leaves&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Flowering Seed Plants&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial34_Fig1.jpg" title="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flowering seed plants are more prevalent than nonflowering seed plants. As depicted in the figure at the right a flower consists of four main parts: sepals, petals, stamens, and carpels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sepals&lt;/strong&gt; are the outermost, leaf-like parts of the flower. &lt;strong&gt;Petals&lt;/strong&gt; are the next whorl of parts in from the sepals, and they are usually the structure that we think of when we talk about flowers. However, plants can reproduce without petals or sepals because neither is a gamete-producing structure. The &lt;strong&gt;stamen&lt;/strong&gt; is the male structure of a flower. It is made up of a slender &lt;strong&gt;filament&lt;/strong&gt; and the pollen-producing &lt;strong&gt;anther&lt;/strong&gt;. The &lt;strong&gt;carpel&lt;/strong&gt; is the female structure. It is located in the center of the flower and consists of a &lt;strong&gt;stigma&lt;/strong&gt;, a &lt;strong&gt;style&lt;/strong&gt;, and an ovary. The pollen grain lands on the stigma, where it germinates, then the pollen tube grows through the style to the ovule within an ovary. This is in contrast to the female cone of a nonflowering seed plant. Recall, in the nonflowering seed plant the pollen grain enters the micropyle and the pollen tube grows through the ovule tissue, but the ovule is not contained in an ovary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Flower Anatomy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All flowers have stamens and/or carpels. In addition to these basic parts, a flower can have petals and/or sepals. These parts are arranged in various patterns, however, there is an evolutionary trend toward bilateral symmetry. If a flower has both reproductive parts (stamens and carpels), it is a &lt;strong&gt;perfect flower&lt;/strong&gt;. If a flower has only one of these reproductive parts, it is an &lt;strong&gt;imperfect flower&lt;/strong&gt;. Imperfect flowers are further classified as &lt;strong&gt;staminate&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;carpellate&lt;/strong&gt;, depending on which part is present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial34_Fig1_0.jpg" title="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some plants (e.g., corn) have staminate flowers on one part of the plant (the tassels at the top) and carpellate flowers on another part (the ears on the stalk). Recall from the &lt;a href="https://online.science.psu.edu/biol110_sandbox_2381/node/8950" target="_blank" title="Tutorial 33 - Plants III - Seed Plants (Non-Flowering)"&gt;previous section&lt;/a&gt;, these are monoecious species. The word monoecious comes from the Greek words meaning &quot;one house.&quot; When the staminate and carpellate flowers are found on separate plants, they are a dioecious species (&quot;two houses&quot;). Kiwi plants are an example of a dioecious species. Kiwi growers need to grow many female plants for fruit and some male plants for pollination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stamen, the male part of a flower, consists of a filament and an anther. The filament is just what its name implies; a long, thin structure that supports the anther. The anther is at the tip of the filament, and its function is to produce pollen grains. The carpel, the female part of a flower, consists of a stigma, a style and an ovary. The ovary is at the base of the carpel and it houses the ovule(s), which produces the egg cell. The style is the long portion of the carpel that supports the stigma. The stigma is the tip of the carpel. It functions to catch the pollen grains, hence it is often sticky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Pollination&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order for a plant to reproduce sexually, the male pollen must reach the female stigma in a process called &lt;strong&gt;pollination&lt;/strong&gt;. Some plants (e.g., corn) pollinate via the wind. You have seen the silk coming out of an ear of corn. These are the styles and stigmas of the female flowers. The male pollen is located at the top of the plant in the tassels, appropriately located for the wind to distribute the pollen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="0" src="http://c.gigcount.com/wildfire/IMP/CXNID=2000002.0NXC/bT*xJmx*PTEzMTA3NTUzNzM3NTUmcHQ9MTMxMDc1NTY4MjAxNCZwPTIwNjQyMSZkPWIyMTUwMTE5Jmc9MiZvPTk2NjhhNGRlZDA4/NDRmNzlhYTY1ZTI4N2RlOTA2Y2E4Jm9mPTA=.gif" style="visibility: hidden; width: 0px; height: 0px;" width="0" /&gt;&lt;object data="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2150119" height="480" hspace="10" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" vspace="10" width="640"&gt;&lt;param name="quality" value="high" /&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2150119" /&gt;&lt;param name="wmode" value="transparent" /&gt;&lt;param name="src" value="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2150119" /&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some plants are pollinated by animals (e.g., bees and hummingbirds). Their flowers are specially colored and shaped to attract a specific pollinator. Bees are able to see white and yellow coloration. Flowers pollinated by bees tend to have sturdy petals to support the weight of a bee, and short stamens and carpels so that the pollen can transfer to and from the bee while it eats nectar. Hummingbird-pollinated flowers tend to be red, and the petals usually form a long tubular-shaped corolla. The hummingbird is attracted to the red color. When the hummingbird reaches its long beak into the corolla to eat the nectar, its forehead or throat contacts the stigma and/or anther to transfer pollen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The various relationships between flowers and their pollinators are good examples of coevolution. That is, the character of the flower is typically uniquely suited for a particular pollinator. One striking example occurs in flowers that are pollinated by flies. One flower, found in Malaysia, gives off a putrid smell of rotting meat that flies find quite appealing. This flower is not frequented by bees, nor do flies frequent the flowers that have smells the bees (and ourselves) find desirable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Life Cycle of Flowering Seed Plants&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial34_Fig2.jpg" title="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like all plants, flowering seed plants exhibit alternation of generations. We will look at some of the important features in this life cycle (shown here on the right). The anthers are made up of diploid (2n) cells that undergo meiosis to form haploid (1n) cells (microspores). A microspore will undergo a series of changes (including the acquisition of a tough cell wall), leading to the formation of a pollen grain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, in the female ovary each diploid ovule undergoes meiosis to produce a megaspore that is haploid. This megaspore divides by mitosis, three times, to produce eight haploid nuclei in seven cells. One of these cells is the egg, and one cell is larger than the others and contains two nuclei. Together, the seven cells constitute the &lt;strong&gt;embryo sac&lt;/strong&gt;, which is the female gametophyte. This gametophyte is totally enclosed within the ovary of the parent plant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, the egg is ready to be fertilized and the pollen grain is ready for dispersal. Pollen grains need their tough outer wall to survive the process of pollination (the transfer of pollen to the female flower parts). Once the pollen grain lands on the stigma, it germinates. One cell begins to grow a pollen tube that extends down into the style. The other cell can then divide by mitosis to form two haploid sperm cells. It is at this point (with two sperm cells and one pollen tube) that the male gametophyte is mature and contains three haploid cells. If successful, the pollen tube will grow into an ovule and discharge its sperm cells. There are mechanisms to prevent more than one pollen tube from entering a given ovule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial34_DoubleFertilization1fig3.gif" title="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once inside the ovule, one sperm cell fuses with the egg and the other fuses with the large cell that has two nuclei. Recall from the &lt;a href="https://online.science.psu.edu/biol110_sandbox_2381/node/8950" target="_blank" title="Tutorial 33 - Plants III - Seed Plants (Non-Flowering)"&gt;previous section&lt;/a&gt;, this is known as double fertilization. The diploid zygote forms from the fusion of the sperm and the egg. A triploid cell forms from the fusion of the other sperm and the central cell. The zygote grows within the seed and eventually the seed germinates and grows into a mature, diploid, sporophytic plant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Seed Anatomy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial34_Fig4.jpg" title="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A seed is a genetically complex structure. It contains diploid and triploid components. In addition, the outer layers of the seed are derived from maternal ovule tissue. Therefore, in addition to having two different ploidy states, the resulting seed is made up of parental and F1 sporophytic tissue. To examine this more closely, we will explore the development and anatomy of a seed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;The cell that results from the fusion of the egg and one sperm becomes the zygote. It is diploid and begins to form the basic structures of the embryo (i.e., the embryonic root and the &lt;strong&gt;cotyledons&lt;/strong&gt;). The cotyledons are also called &quot;seed leaves.&quot; Plants that belong to Class Monocotyledone contain only one cotyledon and are referred to as &lt;strong&gt;monocotyledons&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;monocots&lt;/strong&gt;; some common examples are grass and corn. The other class of angiosperms is Dicotyledone. Plants in this class have two cotyledons and are referred to as &lt;strong&gt;dicotyledons&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;dicots&lt;/strong&gt;; some common examples are beans and pumpkins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="0" src="http://c.gigcount.com/wildfire/IMP/CXNID=2000002.0NXC/bT*xJmx*PTEzMTA3NTU3NTAzNzImcHQ9MTMxMDc1NTc1MjQzOSZwPTIwNjQyMSZkPWIyMTUwMTYyJmc9MiZvPTk2NjhhNGRlZDA4/NDRmNzlhYTY1ZTI4N2RlOTA2Y2E4Jm9mPTA=.gif" style="visibility: hidden; width: 0px; height: 0px;" width="0" /&gt;&lt;object data="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2150162" height="480" hspace="10" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" vspace="10" width="640"&gt;&lt;param name="quality" value="high" /&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2150162" /&gt;&lt;param name="wmode" value="transparent" /&gt;&lt;param name="src" value="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2150162" /&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cell that results from the other fertilization event is 3n. It has one nucleus formed from two nuclei from the female gametophyte, and one nucleus from the male gametophyte. This triploid nucleus divides to produce a multinucleate cell. The tissue that forms from the triploid cell is known as &lt;strong&gt;endosperm&lt;/strong&gt;, which contains the nutrients needed by the developing embryo. As a dicot embryo matures, most, if not all, of the endosperm is absorbed by the embryo. However, a monocot embryo usually does not absorb all of the endosperm. When we eat corn, the majority of the nutrients we eat are endosperm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recall from the nonflowering seed plant tutorial, the seed coat is formed from tissues in the ovule termed integuments. These tissues are diploid and are part of the parent plant. Thus, a seed consists of tissues that are made up entirely of the parental type (maternal sporophytic) and tissues that result from the recent fertilization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Plant Growth&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial34_Fig5.jpg" title="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plant growth is astonishing. Not only can plants live incredibly long (e.g., 4,600-year-old bristlecone pines), but they can also become quite large in a short lifetime. The tallest tree ever measured was a 435 foot eucalyptus in Australia. There is a giant sequoia tree named General Sherman in California (shown above). It is not the tallest, nor the widest, nor the oldest plant on Earth, but it does occupy more space than any other single organism. Its volume is estimated to be 52,508 cubic feet. That is equivalent to thirty, double-occupancy dorm rooms!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial34_Fig6.jpg" title="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plant growth differs from animal growth. Most plants follow a pattern of &lt;strong&gt;indeterminate growth&lt;/strong&gt;, whereas most animals have &lt;strong&gt;determinate growth&lt;/strong&gt;. Animals generally form all of their organs and then grow until they reach a certain size. Plants develop organs as they grow. They do not have a predetermined size, and they continue to grow as long as they live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This continuous growth can be attributed to &lt;strong&gt;meristems&lt;/strong&gt;. Meristems are unique tissues that have the ability to divide. In many cases meristems contain cells with the potential to form any cell in the plant. Thus, they provide a reservoir of cells that can continuously become more specialized cells; this enables the plant to generate new tissues and organs throughout its life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two main types of plant meristems: apical and lateral. &lt;strong&gt;Apical meristems&lt;/strong&gt; are found at the apex, or tip, of a plant (i.e., there are root apical meristems and shoot apical meristems). The apical meristems are responsible for adding new plant parts (e.g., stems and leaves), and to extend roots. This is known as &lt;strong&gt;primary growth&lt;/strong&gt;. All plants undergo primary growth. &lt;strong&gt;Herbaceous&lt;/strong&gt; (nonwoody) plants, the monocots, and some dicots only exhibit primary growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;lateral meristem&lt;/strong&gt; is responsible for lateral growth. In other words, a plant grows wider due to lateral meristematic action. This is known as &lt;strong&gt;secondary growth&lt;/strong&gt;. For instance, consider a tree. It starts life as a short, thin seedling. The first, or primary, need for the plant is the height to access light for photosynthesis. The apical meristem provides for this height, and also for adding length to the roots. As the tree starts to get taller, there is the secondary need for a wider trunk that is stronger. The lateral meristems provide this growth in width. Specifically, lateral meristems are responsible for the tree rings that are added with each year of new growth. The primary growth at apical meristems happens in younger tissues, and the secondary growth at lateral meristems happens mostly in older tissues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Roots&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A plant can be divided into two main parts: the &lt;strong&gt;shoots&lt;/strong&gt; (the aerial part of the plant) and the &lt;strong&gt;roots&lt;/strong&gt;. The roots serve many purposes. First, they anchor the plant in the ground. Second, they take up water and mineral nutrients. Water is constantly being used and evaporated from the shoots, so it needs to be replaced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to these two primary functions of all roots, some roots are modified for special purposes. For example, consider a carrot. The part that we eat is modified for storage (it also anchors the plant). If we did not eat the carrot, the reserves it contains would be used for the next year&amp;#39;s growth of new shoots in the spring. Likewise, deciduous trees (non-evergreens) have many carbohydrate reserves in their roots to help them grow new leaves each spring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial34_Fig7.jpg" title="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some roots are modified to accommodate special living conditions. Epiphytic orchids reside up high in trees. They have aerial roots that attach the plant to the trunk or branch of a tree (image on right). Other plants, such as poison ivy, have typical roots in the soil, as well as aerial roots that the climbing vines use to attach to the trunk of a tree as it grows upward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roots can also be modified to interact with other organisms. Many roots form symbiotic relationships with fungi (mycorrhizae) or bacteria (rhizobia). In tutorial 20, you learned about the nitrogen-fixing bacteria that form a mutualistic symbiosis, whereby the bacteria receive carbohydrates and shelter from the plant; the plant receives usable nitrogen from the bacteria, who fix atmospheric nitrogen into ammonia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we normally think of only leaves or stems as capable of photosynthesis, some roots also photosynthesize. Their cells contain active chloroplasts, therefore, the root tissue is green in appearance. Of course, most of these roots exist above ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some roots are capable of &lt;strong&gt;vegetative reproduction&lt;/strong&gt;. If one were to cut a carrot into pieces, they could grow a new carrot plant from each piece of the original root.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Stems&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While roots are primarily found below the ground, stems are primarily found above the ground. Stems consist of &lt;strong&gt;nodes&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;internodes&lt;/strong&gt;. Nodes are the location where leaves are attached to the stem, and internodes are the spaces between the nodes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stem has two main functions: support and transport. Recall, vascular tissue is composed of xylem and phloem, which act as vessels to move water and nutrients in the plant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stems, like roots, come in many shapes and sizes, with modifications for special functions. For example, consider a cactus. Some have stems that have been modified to store large amounts of water. This feature is adaptive for the desert climate in which they live. The plants take up large quantities of water during the few short periods of rain, and this allows them to live through periods of drought. Stems can also be modified to store carbohydrates. A potato is actually a special type of modified stem called a &lt;strong&gt;tuber&lt;/strong&gt;. Technically, it is stem tissue that grows underground, but often it is mistaken for a root.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another modification that stems share with roots is the ability to reproduce vegetatively. Remember, vegetative reproduction does not involve seeds. Many plants (e.g., geraniums and philodendrons) can be reproduced by stem cuttings. The piece that is cut off then forms new roots from its meristematic tissue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stems can also provide the plant with protection. They can have thick epidermal cells, or have thorns along their length. Anchorage is another function of some stems. The stems of the morning glory vine twine themselves around other plants or fences. This anchors them in the wind and rain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although we do not think of plants as being mobile, some stems can use growth to change their location. Plants can grow taller by adding length to their stems (e.g., competing trees in a forest). Vines can grow longer to get to different habitats for things such as light, water, or additional space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Leaves&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leaves are located on stems at nodes. Unlike humans, who obtain their carbohydrates from the foods they eat, plants make their own carbohydrates. Most leaves contain more chloroplasts than other parts of the plant, and this is where most photosynthesis takes place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as roots and stems can have specially modified structures for special functions, so can leaves. We already discussed how roots and stems can function in anchorage. Leaves can also be modified to hold a plant in place. The &lt;strong&gt;tendrils&lt;/strong&gt; of cucumbers or pea plants are modified leaves. Therefore, pea plants are able to climb up a fence by sending out modified leaves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leaves also function in protection, both physically and chemically. The spines of a cactus are actually modified leaves. They strongly discourage herbivores from eating their protected fleshy stems. Other leaves, like those on nettle plants, have both physical and chemical modifications. Tiny needle-like structures on the leaves contain a toxic substance designed to discourage herbivores. If you have ever accidentally run into a nettle, you understand just how powerful this deterrent is!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leaves can also have modifications to help collect and store water. Have you ever noticed the rosette formation of leaves on the top of a pineapple? Pineapples belong to a group of plants known as the bromeliads. The rosette pattern of their leaves is used to capture water until the plant can absorb it. A second family of plants, succulents, is well known for having leaves that store water. Are you familiar with the aloe plant? It has thick leaves that are very juicy inside. The leaves are designed to store water so that the plant can survive during periods of drought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leaves can function in much the same way as roots and stems for vegetative propagation. Two examples are Rex begonias and African violets. The leaves of these plants contain the meristematic tissue necessary to produce both stems and roots, under the appropriate conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probably the most intriguing modification of leaves occurs in carnivorous plants. The Venus flytrap has leaves that lay flat, waiting for an unsuspecting fly to land. When the fly lands, it triggers sensory hairs that cause the leaf to rapidly fold at its hinge, trapping the fly inside. Digestive juices are then secreted to kill and metabolize the fly. The resulting nutrients are then absorbed into the leaf. This process is similar to the digestive tract of an animal, with one notable exception. The fly primarily provides mineral nutrients (e.g., nitrogen), rather than carbohydrates&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This concludes the tutorial on flowering seed plants, and also the four-part tutorial series on plants. The life cycle of flowering seed plants is closely tied to their flower and seed structures. In all cases, plants show a pattern of alternation of generations. When studying, be sure that you understand the basic similarities and differences in how this alternation is accomplished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also surveyed the major plant structures of flowering seed plants, and how they have evolved for a variety of purposes. Keep in mind, evolution works on existing structures, and one of the remarkable features of plant evolution is the functional diversity of these basic structures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also briefly reviewed the role of meristems, and their contributions to plant growth. Basically, all meristems supply the plant with cells that will go on to differentiate into various specialized tissues. The two major meristematic centers are the apical meristems and the lateral meristems. The apical meristems function to allow linear growth (they allow shoots to grow up and roots to grow down), whereas lateral meristems add girth, or sideways growth to organs.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

&lt;h2&gt;Introduction and Goals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial35_Fig1.jpg" title="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tutorial will cover the vast and variable Kingdom Fungi, and its sizable impact on the environment. &lt;strong&gt;Fungi&lt;/strong&gt; (fungus, sing.), like bacteria, are most commonly decomposers, assisting in the essential task of recycling nutrients in ecosystems. The majority of all plant species depend on symbiotic fungi for enhanced water and nutrient absorption. Other species have been exploited by humans for centuries for the production of bread, beer, wine, cheese, and edible fruitbodies (mushrooms). Antibiotic-producing fungi (e.g., &lt;em&gt;Pennicillium chysogenum&lt;/em&gt;) have changed the face of modern medicine, saving millions of lives. Conversely, other species cause economically important and often devastating diseases to plants and animals (humans included). Fungal-induced plant disease epidemics have had dramatic historical influences, resulting in starvation, war, and human migration. Fungi are also responsible for the rots that damage timber, agricultural products, and human-made structures. Yet some fungi produce conspicuous fruiting bodies and are the source of endless fascination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial35_Fig2.jpg" title="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the end of this tutorial you should have a fundamental understanding of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The roles and importance of fungi in the biosphere&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Basic fungal nutrition&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Basic morphological diversity within the kingdom&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Basic reproductive features of fungi&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Basic Biology and Morphology&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial35_Crinipellis_perniciosa_mushroom.jpg" style="height: 862px; width: 600px;" title="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although there are now more than 100,000 described species of fungi, mycologists (scientists who study fungi) estimate that there are probably more than 1.5 million species. The kingdom is comprised of four major phyla or divisions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Chytridiomycota&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Zygomycota&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Ascomycota&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Basidiomycota&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The categorization of fungi is based on life cycle features. In some cases, a complete sexual life cycle has not been observed and some mycologists use a fifth phylum (Imperfecta or Deuteromycota) as a repository for these species. However, as scientists apply molecular techniques to understand fungal relationships, the artificial nature of this fifth phylum is becoming apparent and it is falling into disfavor. Hence, this tutorial will concentrate on the four phyla listed above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although originally grouped with plants, modern molecular systematists now think the lineage that gave rise to modern fungi arose before plants (possibly one billion years ago). Protists are related to fungi, with a possible link in the Chytridiomycota.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial35_Fig4.jpg" title="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All fungi are heterotrophic, and many are important and rather prolific decomposers, recycling organic carbon trapped mostly in plant cell walls as lignin and cellulose. A major distinguishing feature of the kingdom is *absorptive nutrition*. Food sources are digested externally, then absorbed into their cells. They produce copious amounts of organic acids to acidify their local environment, followed by powerful digestive enzymes to break down their food source. Fungi are almost unlimited in what they can digest. Everything from trees to human skin (e.g., athlete&amp;#39;s foot) are subject to fungal decay. Fungi are also distinguished by their filamentous vegetative structures, *hyphae* (hypha, sing.; somewhat different structurally from the hyphae of the oomycota discussed in the &lt;a href="https://online.science.psu.edu/biol110_sandbox_2381/node/8930"&gt;Protists II section&lt;/a&gt;), and the presence of chitin as a primary cell wall polymer. A group or mass of hyphae (&lt;strong&gt;mycelium&lt;/strong&gt;) may be visible to the naked eye as a white or gray fuzz on moldy bread or on a decaying tree. Extensive networks of mycelium give fungi a tremendous amount of surface area in a small space, making them ideally adapted to their absorptive mode of nutrition. Cellular specialization is somewhat limited in the kingdom. As depicted in this figure on the right, hyphae can be characterized as having cells clearly delimited by structures called *septa* (&lt;strong&gt;septate hyphae&lt;/strong&gt;), or the absence of septa (&lt;strong&gt;coenocytic hyphae&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many fungal plant parasites invade host tissue with specialized structures (&lt;strong&gt;haustoria&lt;/strong&gt;) that are used to absorb the cellular contents of their hosts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Environmental Impact&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Members of the kingdom Fungi produce spores. Although they are mostly nonmotile (some members of the Chytridiomycota produce flagellated spores), spores (produced by the thousands or millions) can be dispersed by water and/or wind great distances to another available substrate or host. Spores are an important taxonomic character and, as expected, come in a myriad of shapes and sizes. Spores can be mitotically or meiotically produced, affording the organism flexibility to reproduce and proliferate over a variety of environmental conditions where sexual recombination may not be feasible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fungi play many roles in the biosphere. As you have already learned, they are important decomposers as well as plant and human pathogens. They also engage in extremely important symbiotic relationships with plants and algae. &lt;strong&gt;Mycorrhizae&lt;/strong&gt; are an intimate association (symbiosis) between plant roots and fungal hyphae. The vast majority are mutualistic, with the plant or tree benefiting with increased water and nutrient uptake and the fungus obtaining carbon from the roots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Symbioses with lichens are also common. Specific fungal species (usually Ascomycetes) grow in concert with these photosynthetic algae. The fungus gains carbon and provides moisture to the algae in a controlled parasitic relationship. Technically, it&amp;#39;s not a mutualistic relationship since the alga can live on its own and is consumed by the fungus; however, it is a unique relationship since lichens can grow in extremely harsh climates (e.g., the arctic tundra and bare rocks).&amp;nbsp; Click &lt;a href="http://waynesword.palomar.edu/pljan98c.htm" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see some spectacular images of fructicose and foliose lichens and &lt;a href="http://waynesword.palomar.edu/pljan98b.htm" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see some crustose rock lichens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Basic Biological and Reproductive Features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial35_Fig5.jpg" style="width: 552px; height: 368px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fungi exhibit several different types of life cycles. This generalized diagram on the right depicts the typical sequence of events in the life cycles of fungi. Focus on the &quot;mycelium&quot; box for a starting point for both the sexual and asexual life cycles. Note, many species can produce asexual spores in specialized spore-producing structures. This allows the organism to clone itself while, often times, producing huge numbers of asexual spores. The hyphae of many species are haploid during the majority of their life cycles. Many fungi spend a good portion of their life in the asexual mode. The transition to the sexual mode can be triggered by certain conditions (e.g., light, temperature, moisture, availability of a sexually compatible partner, and limited nutrient availability).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sexual stage is characterized by several features that are unique to the kingdom Fungi. Most fungal mating types are morphologically indistinguishable, and so, they are not referred to as male or female. Rather, they are simply referred to as &quot;+&quot; or &quot;-&quot; to let one know they are different (and hence, sexually compatible). In the case of sexual reproduction, compatible mating types fuse in a process that involves &lt;strong&gt;plasmogamy&lt;/strong&gt; (fusion of cell membranes). This fusion produces a &lt;strong&gt;dikaryon&lt;/strong&gt; (a mycelium with two genetically distinct nuclei), which can divide in the growing mycelium for a prolonged period. The prolonged dikaryotic stage is a feature unique to fungi. It is thought that the dikaryotic state provides the organism with genetic flexibility in a competitive environment while, at the same time, conferring it with many of the same advantages as a diploid because it possesses a complementary set of chromosomes. The dikaryotic state can last for months, or even years, while the fungus continues to grow and proliferate in its environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another unique feature of the dikaryon is that paired nuclei (n+n) can, and often times do, migrate freely through the mycelium. Some cells may contain two or more pairs, and some (particularly actively growing hyphal tips), even more. When environmental conditions are suitable, the two haploid nuclei fuse (&lt;strong&gt;karyogamy&lt;/strong&gt;) to form a highly transient diploid state. Meiosis follows, almost immediately, in a specialized spore-producing structure, and genetically distinct haploid spores are produced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Features of Hyphal Growth&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hyphal growth occurs at the tip. As was mentioned, these actively growing areas are often characterized by the presence of multiple pairs of nuclei and a large number of vesicles moving toward the hyphal tip. Click &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X77ae6xhK3s&amp;feature=related" target="_blank"&gt;hyphal growth&lt;/a&gt; to view a short film on the process of hyphal growth. Note the massive amounts of cytoplasmic streaming and the movement of vesicles along arrays of microtubules toward the actively growing tip. Near the end of the movie, also note the appearance of a nucleus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Fungal Diversity and the Phylum Chytridiomycota&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial35_Fig6_0.jpg" title="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modern fungal systematists have divided the fungal kingdom into four major phyla. We will start with what is thought to be the ancestral phylum of the kingdom, Chytridiomycota. &lt;strong&gt;Chytrids&lt;/strong&gt; (members of the phylum) are mostly aquatic, which is why they are often called &quot;water fungi.&quot; This phylum has only recently been determined to belong to Kingdom Fungi, therefore, not all textbooks include it in this kingdom. Biologically, they are mostly saprobes (introduced in the&lt;a href="https://online.science.psu.edu/biol110_sandbox_2381/node/8979"&gt; Prokaryotes II: Evolution and Early Metabolism&lt;/a&gt; section) decomposers that absorb nutrients from dead organic matter), but some species are parasites of aquatic invertebrates, plants, and protists. They are also characterized as having absorptive nutrition and they can have septate or coenocytic mycelium, or be unicellular. Morphologically, they are important because some members possess flagellated spores. Until recently, systematists believed that the absence of flagellated cells was required for placement in the fungal kingdom. Molecular data have shown that chytrids are indeed members of the fungal kingdom. Ultrastructural and biochemical data (e.g., chitinous cell walls) support this designation as well. The molecular data also support the theory that they are the most primitive group in the kingdom; they retain the ancestral character of having flagellated cells similar to their protistan ancestors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Phylum Zygomycota&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the roughly 600 described species in the phylum Zygomycota, most are terrestrial and exist as saprobes in soil or on decaying plant material. Several species are important because they form mycorrhizae with forest plants and trees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial35_Fig7.jpg" title="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many common bread molds (e.g., &lt;em&gt;Rhizopus stolonifer&lt;/em&gt;) are &lt;strong&gt;zygomycetes&lt;/strong&gt;. Morphologically, they have coenocytic hyphae, with septa formed only in association with reproductive structures. The phylum gets it name from the production of the &lt;strong&gt;zygosporangium&lt;/strong&gt;. This figure on the right illustrates the events in the life cycle of a zygomycete. Concentrate on the top portion of the diagram. As you have learned, two different haploid mating types are often required for sexual reproduction in the fungi. First, &lt;strong&gt;gametangia&lt;/strong&gt; begin to form on dissimilar hyphae (step 1). The gametangia then fuse (step 2) to form the dikaryotic state (step 3). The dikaryotic zygosporangium then develops (step 4). The zygosporangium develops a rough and thickened cell wall, which renders it resistant to harsh &quot;over-wintering&quot; conditions. When conditions become favorable for &lt;strong&gt;zygospore&lt;/strong&gt; germination, compatible (&quot;+&quot; and &quot;- &quot; mating types) nuclei fuse and a diploid is briefly formed (step 5). Meiosis immediately follows and millions of haploid zygospores are formed (step 6). The zygosporangium germinates and releases the aforementioned spores and the cycle begins again (step 7). The asexual stage alternates between mycelial growth and asexual spore production (as shown in bottom part of figure).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;object data="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2150437" height="480" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="640"&gt;&lt;param name="quality" value="high" /&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2150437" /&gt;&lt;param name="wmode" value="transparent" /&gt;&lt;embed height="480" hspace="10" quality="high" src="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2150437" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" vspace="10" width="640" wmode="transparent"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tutorial introduced the fungi. Fungi have an important saprophytic role in the biosphere. You might not find the subject of decomposition pleasant, but without the fungi (and other decomposers) a good proportion of nutrients would remain tied up in dead organisms and never get recycled back into the biosphere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fungi obtain their nutrition by secreting various hydrolytic enzymes into their environment. They then absorb the resulting monomeric units. This mode of nutrition is known as absorptive nutrition and is intimately related to the role that these organisms play in degrading organic matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic aspects of fungal life cycles were also introduced. Not all fungi have a sexual mode of reproduction, but when they do, the haploid state is the most prominent. An important feature that fungi demonstrate is the presence of a dikaryotic state, in which two haploid nuclei exist in the same cell. When these nuclei fuse, the resulting diploid nucleus undergoes meiosis very soon afterward to give rise to haploid spores. Thus, the diploid state (as defined by the presence of a true diploid nucleus) is very transient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hypha is the prominent cell type in the fungal kingdom. Hyphae can exhibit tremendous growth rates via tip growth, whereby new cellular material is continuously being added to the growing tip of the extending cell. Hyphae of fungi and oomycetes are analogous structures that look the same but have different wall properties. (Fungal walls are composed of chitin, whereas the walls of oomycetes are made of cellulose.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also examined two fungal phyla, the Chytridomycota (thought to represent the most ancestral state) and the Zygomycota (a common bread mold). Be sure you understand the life cycle of a zygomycete, and in the next tutorial you will learn how this life cycle distinguishes this phylum from others in the fungal kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

&lt;h1&gt;Introduction and Goals&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This second and final tutorial on fungi will continue our discussion of fungal diversity by covering the two remaining phyla, Ascomycota and Basidiomycota. By the end of this tutorial you should have a basic understanding of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The life cycle of Phylum Ascomycota&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The life cycle of Phylum Basidiomycota&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The basic morphology of an ascomycete&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The basic morphology of a basdiomycete&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Phylum Ascomycota: General Biology and Morphology&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial36_800px-XN_Ascomycete.jpg" style="height: 262px; width: 350px;" title="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our discussion of fungal diversity resumes with the phylum Ascomycota. With over 60,000 described species, it is the largest, most biologically and morphologically diverse group in the kingdom. It houses some of the most destructive human and plant pathogens, includes many that form various mutualistic symbioses, and ranges morphologically from unicellular &lt;strong&gt;yeasts&lt;/strong&gt; to complex cup fungi. Almost half of all members of the phylum Ascomycota form symbiotic associations with algae to form lichens (described Under &lt;a href="https://online.science.psu.edu/biol110_sandbox_2381/node/8965"&gt;Fungi I&lt;/a&gt; under &quot;Environmental Impact&quot;). Others, such as morels (a highly prized edible fungi), form important mychorrhizal relationships with plants, thereby providing enhanced water and nutrient uptake and, in some cases, protection from insects. Thus, in a typical forest, &lt;strong&gt;ascomycetes&lt;/strong&gt; can visually manifest themselves as everything from a conspicuous mushroom to disease symptoms on the surface of plant leaves. This group also houses single-celled yeasts. These members of the Ascomycota have been exploited by humans for centuries for the production of fermented foods and beverages (see &lt;a href="https://online.science.psu.edu/biol110_sandbox_2381/node/8995" target="_blank" title="Tutorial 22 - Energy II - Cellular Respiration (Glycolysis)"&gt;hEnerg II, Cellular Respiration&lt;/a&gt; for a review of fermentation). Visit this &lt;a href="http://www.ndsu.nodak.edu/instruct/stack/TDI/aFOL_DIS_3.html" target="_blank"&gt;site&lt;/a&gt; to see some photos of ascomycetes that are tree pathogenes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Basic Morphology&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial36_asci.jpg" title="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The defining morphological character of the phylum Ascomycota is the production of four to eight sexual spores in a microscopic sac-like cell called an &lt;strong&gt;ascus&lt;/strong&gt;, an image of which is shown on the right. Hence, they are sometimes referred to as &quot;&lt;strong&gt;sac fungi&lt;/strong&gt;.&quot; In addition, most ascomycetes bear their asci in macroscopic fruiting bodies called &lt;strong&gt;ascocarps&lt;/strong&gt;. Ascomycetes are also capable of producing enormous amounts of asexual spores called &lt;strong&gt;conidia&lt;/strong&gt;, which allow them to propagate without having to undergo sexual recombination. This feature can be particularly destructive because these plant pathogenic fungi can cause devastating epidemics via repeated rounds of asexual reproduction with the dissemination of billions of conidia in a short period of time. Conidia are usually produced externally on the tips of modified hyphae in simple chains or clusters. Prior to sexual reproduction, compatible haploid mating-type hyphae (+ and -) fuse to form a dikaryotic hypha. In contrast to the basidiomycetes, ascomycetes have a more limited dikaryotic stage. The dikaryotic stage eventually gives rise to an ascocarp and sexual &lt;strong&gt;ascospores&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Phylum Ascomycota: Life Cycle&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial36_Fig2.jpg" title="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s turn our attention to the life cycle of the typical ascomycete depicted in the image on the right. We will start with step 1 in the sexual part of the life cycle, in which two compatible haploid hyphae become intertwined and form an &lt;strong&gt;ascogonium&lt;/strong&gt; and an &lt;strong&gt;antheridium&lt;/strong&gt; (not to be confused with the male gametangium known as an antheridium in plants). In this case, in step 2, the ascogonium acts as a &quot;female&quot; and accepts nuclei from the antheridium after plasmogamy has occurred. In step 3, the resultant dikaryon is then capable of forming a cup-shaped ascocarp. In step 4, asci begin to form on the surface of the ascocarp at the tips of the dikaryotic mycelium, and in step 5, karyogamy occurs to form the highly transient diploid nucleus. In step 6, the diploid nucleus immediately undergoes meiosis, yielding four, genetically distinct, haploid nuclei. In step 7, after an additional round of mitosis, the ascus now contains eight haploid nuclei. In step 8, these eight nuclei will eventually develop into eight ascospores, which are released from the ascus on the surface of the ascocarp. In the final step in the sexual cycle (step 9), haploid mycelia arise from the aforementioned ascospores as the sexual cycle begins again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, turn your attention to the left side of the diagram. Step 10 depicts the asexual part of the life cycle. Here, a compatible haploid partner is not present and the haploid mycelium is capable of producing asexual spores (conidia) by segmentation of its hyphae. These segments will compartmentalize into conidia, and wind or water dispersal will follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="0" src="http://c.gigcount.com/wildfire/IMP/CXNID=2000002.0NXC/bT*xJmx*PTEzMTA5NTc3NzU5NTcmcHQ9MTMxMDk1Nzc4Mzg5OSZwPTIwNjQyMSZkPWIyMTUxNDg1Jmc9MiZvPTk2NjhhNGRlZDA4/NDRmNzlhYTY1ZTI4N2RlOTA2Y2E4Jm9mPTA=.gif" style="visibility: hidden; width: 0px; height: 0px;" width="0" /&gt;&lt;object data="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2151485" height="480" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="640"&gt;&lt;param name="quality" value="high" /&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2151485" /&gt;&lt;param name="wmode" value="transparent" /&gt;&lt;embed height="480" hspace="10" quality="high" src="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2151485" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" vspace="10" width="640" wmode="transparent"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Phylum Basidiomycota: Introduction and General Morphology&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial36_Fig3.jpg" title="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fourth, and final, division in the kingdom Fungi that we will cover is the phylum Basidiomycota. This is the phylum that you are probably most familiar with because it contains fungi which are generally referred to as &lt;strong&gt;gilled fungi&lt;/strong&gt; or gilled mushrooms. However, with over 25,000 classified species, it also houses diverse members such as puffballs, shelf fungi, and rusts (which are important plant pathogens). &lt;strong&gt;Basidiomycetes&lt;/strong&gt; are often called &lt;strong&gt;club fungi&lt;/strong&gt; because the cells (&lt;strong&gt;basidia&lt;/strong&gt;) that bear the sexual spores resemble a small club. Biologically, basidiomycetes follow the same theme as the rest of the fungal kingdom; they are important decomposers, plant pathogens, and symbionts with plants (mycorrhizal). In particular, basidomycetes excel at breaking down large plant cell wall polymers (e.g., lignin found in decaying wood). Morphologically, they range in complexity from microscopic single cells to conspicuous fruiting bodies called &lt;strong&gt;basidiocarps&lt;/strong&gt;. A mushroom that you are likely to see in a forest or at the grocery store is a basidiocarp. Produced during its sexual cycle, it can bear millions of spores on club-shaped basidia located on the surface of its gills. The production of gills underneath the cap is an adaptation that provides a large surface area for spore production. Amazingly, the surface areas on the gills of a store-bought button mushroom could cover the surface of a large trash can lid. This is an example of a highly evolved, morphological feature of gilled fungi. The gills are protected by the top of the cap and elevated by the stem of the basidiocarp for efficient wind dispersal of its &lt;strong&gt;basidiospores&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial36_Fig4.jpg" title="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basidiomycetes have also developed unique methods for spore dispersal. Some species produce their spores on basidia in a slimy mass that emits an odor similar to rotting carrion. Flies are attracted to the smell and, in doing so, become agents of spore dispersal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Phylum Basidiomycota: Life Cycle&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;Although some basidiomycetes produce asexual spores, asexual reproduction is far more common in the phylum Ascomycota. Therefore, we will discuss a generalized life cycle covering sexual reproduction. Turn your attention to the basidiomycete life cycle diagram on the right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="0" src="http://c.gigcount.com/wildfire/IMP/CXNID=2000002.0NXC/bT*xJmx*PTEzMTA5NTc5NTU4OTkmcHQ9MTMxMDk1Nzk1ODEyOCZwPTIwNjQyMSZkPWIyMTUxNDkxJmc9MiZvPTk2NjhhNGRlZDA4/NDRmNzlhYTY1ZTI4N2RlOTA2Y2E4Jm9mPTA=.gif" style="visibility: hidden; width: 0px; height: 0px;" width="0" /&gt;&lt;object data="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2151491" height="480" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="640"&gt;&lt;param name="quality" value="high" /&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2151491" /&gt;&lt;param name="wmode" value="transparent" /&gt;&lt;embed height="480" hspace="10" quality="high" src="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2151491" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" vspace="10" width="640" wmode="transparent"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In steps 1 and 2, two haploid hyphae of opposite mating types fuse to produce a dikaryotic hypha. In step 3, under favorable environmental conditions (optimum temperature and moisture levels), the dikaryotic hypha is capable of producing a fruitbody; in this case, a gilled mushroom. In step 4, basidia begin to form on the surface of the gills, and in step 5, karyogamy occurs to form a diploid nucleus in each basidium. In step 6, meiosis immediately follows karyogamy and each of four genetically distinct, haploid nuclei migrates into appendages and develops into basidiospores. Basidiospores are released and wind dispersed. They germinate into haploid hyphae and the cycle begins again in step 7.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Summary&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This concludes our discussion on the kingdom Fungi. You should now have a basic understanding of the general biology of the four phyla that comprise the kingdom, including ecological roles, basic biology, reproductive features, and fungal diversity. Proceed on to the review questions and be sure to review sections where you need to refamiliarize yourself with the material.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

&lt;h1&gt;Introduction and Goals&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial41_Fig1.jpg" title="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This last tutorial examines the deuterostomes in the phylum Chordata. This phylum contains three subphyla: Vertebrata, Cephalochordata, and Urochordata. We will explore the features that characterize this phylum and how these structures have evolved for many purposes. By the end of this tutorial you should have an understanding of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The characteristics of chordates&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The characteristics of organisms within the invertebrate subphyla of Phylum Chordata&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The characteristics of organisms within the vertebrate subphylum of Phylum Chordata&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Phylum Chordata&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial41_Fig2.jpg" title="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chordates&lt;/strong&gt; embody many sophisticated evolutionary adaptations. They have four major characters that distinguish them from other deuterostomes: a notochord, a dorsal nerve cord, pharyngeal slits, and a postanal tail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dorsal, hollow &lt;strong&gt;nerve cord&lt;/strong&gt; is basically a sheet of ectoderm rolled into a tube. A chordate&amp;#39;s nerve cord develops into the brain and spinal cord in adults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just below the nerve cord is the &lt;strong&gt;notochord&lt;/strong&gt;, which exists in all chordate embryos. The notochord is a long flexible rod that provides skeletal support. Typically the muscles surrounding the notochord are arranged in distinct segments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;pharyngeal slits&lt;/strong&gt; are openings in the &lt;strong&gt;pharynx&lt;/strong&gt; (part of the throat) of an animal. In the most primitive state these slits allow water to enter the mouth and exit without passing through the digestive system. In the more derived state the pharyngeal slits (and the tissue between them, the pharyngeal arches) serve various functions, ranging from gas exchange to food collection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial41_Fig3.jpg" title="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At some point in their development, all chordates have a tail (a &lt;strong&gt;postanal tail&lt;/strong&gt;) that extends beyond the anus. As with all of these basic chordate characteristics, the tail can be present in the developing embryo and absent in the adult (depending on the type of organism).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Chordate Subphyla&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial41_Fig4.jpg" title="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are three subphyla within Phylum Chordata: Vertebrata, Urochordata, and Cephalochordata. All members of the subphyla Urochordata and Cephalochordata are &lt;strong&gt;invertebrates&lt;/strong&gt; (animals without backbones), as were all animals discussed in the previous four tutorials. All members of the subphylum Vertebrata are &lt;strong&gt;vertebrates&lt;/strong&gt; (animals with backbones). Subphylum Vertebrata will be discussed later in this tutorial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial41_Fig5.jpg" title="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subphylum Urochordata includes the &lt;strong&gt;tunicates&lt;/strong&gt; (&quot;sea squirts&quot;), which are marine animals that are typically sessile as adults. The lightbulb tunicates pictured here on the right are adhering to coral.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The adult tunicate, illustrated below left, does not appear to possess any of the standard chordate characteristics. However, the larval stage (rightmost figure below) clearly exhibits chordate characteristics; note the notochord, the hollow nerve cord, the pharyngeal gill slits, and the postanal tail. In adults the gill slits are modified for filter feeding. &lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial41_Fig6.jpg" title="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Molecular evidence supports the idea that the urochordates are the group most closely related to the vertebrates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;Subphylum Cephalochordata includes the &lt;strong&gt;cephalochordates&lt;/strong&gt; (lancelets), which are small marine animals that burrow, tail first, into the sand. In this position they are able to draw food particles into their mouths via their waving tentacles. Examine this illustration of the anatomy of an adult lancelet, &lt;em&gt;Branchiostoma&lt;/em&gt;, and be sure you can identify the common chordate characterisitcs retained in the adult cephalochordates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="0" src="http://c.gigcount.com/wildfire/IMP/CXNID=2000002.0NXC/bT*xJmx*PTEzMTE3NDM3MTc5NjcmcHQ9MTMxMTc*MzcyMDU2NyZwPTIwNjQyMSZkPWIyMTYxNjg1Jmc9MiZvPTk2NjhhNGRlZDA4/NDRmNzlhYTY1ZTI4N2RlOTA2Y2E4Jm9mPTA=.gif" style="visibility: hidden; width: 0px; height: 0px;" width="0" /&gt;&lt;object data="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2161685" height="480" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="640"&gt;&lt;param name="quality" value="high" /&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2161685" /&gt;&lt;param name="wmode" value="transparent" /&gt;&lt;embed height="480" hspace="10" quality="high" src="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2161685" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" vspace="10" width="640" wmode="transparent"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Phylum Chordata: Subphylum Vertebrata&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subphylum Vertebrata includes organisms with several basic features, in addition to the typical chordate characteristics. Vertebrates exhibit the most pronounced cephalization, in which the anterior portion of the nervous system (the brain) is enclosed inside a protective case (the skull). &lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial41_Fig7.jpg" title="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These animals all have a &lt;strong&gt;vertebral column&lt;/strong&gt; (backbone) that serves to support the head, anchor muscles, and protect internal organs. The dorsal nerve cord is protected by the vertebral column, and the anterior portion of this nerve cord is protected by a &lt;strong&gt;cranium&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;This figure on the right illustrates the evolutionary relationships among members of Phylum Chordata. Focusing on the vertebrates, note that these all contain a vertebral column. The vertebral column is an axial endoskeletal system that forms dorsally to the notochord. (In the adult, the notochord may persist to some degree.) As you look at the basal characteristics, note the progression of the more derived features: jaws, teeth, lungs, lung derivatives, legs, amniotic eggs, and hair. We will explore these features (and their origins) in more detail in this tutorial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Evolution of The Jaw&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial41_Fig8.jpg" title="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During vertebrate evolution, many modifications have occurred in the pharynx. If you have an opportunity to take a class in mammalian embryology, you will learn that many structures are derived from different regions of the embryonic pharynx (e.g., human nostrils originate from pharyngeal slits, which are present in the early human embryo). We will examine the evolution of the jaw so that you can appreciate how evolutionary biologists think these more derived structures evolved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;These jaw images are arranged left to right, with the more ancestral state on the left and the more derived state on the right. In the ancestral state, endoskeletal elements are seen in the pharyngeal arches between the pharyngeal slits. It is likely that in this configuration the endoskeleton evolved to keep the pharyngeal slits open. However, in a macroevolutionary event that probably involved a change in the allometric growth of the more anterior arches, the endoskeletal elements became thicker and the presence of primitive jaws appeared. These were adapted to capture food more effectively. In the most derived state (depicted on the right), further macroevolutionary events occurred and these anterior bones became thicker and new bony protuberances appeared in the form of teeth. Teeth made predation more efficient, and occur today in many vertebrates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should recognize this gradual adaptation of existing structures for new purposes as a reoccurring theme in evolution. The evolution of other pharyngeal structures, which gave rise to lungs and their derivatives, has also contributed significantly to vertebrate evolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Evolution of Legs and the Amniotic Egg&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial41_Fig9.jpg" title="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Legs and amniotic eggs are two additional derived characters that have played a significant role in the evolution of vertebrates. The significance of legs in the terrestrial environment is obvious. How do evolutionary biologists think they evolved?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;The endoskeletal system of vertebrates consists of the axial elements that are associated with the vertebral column. In addition, more lateral elements, termed the &lt;strong&gt;appendicular skeletal system&lt;/strong&gt;, also exist. The fossil record indicates that the appendicular skeletal system first appeared as small elements in association with fins of early vertebrates. However, a progressive thickening of these elements (again, involving changes in allometric growth) occurred. Some fish have extremely strong fins and are known as &quot;lobefin&quot; fishes. The fossil record (and other data) indicates that the amphibians arose from lobefin fish, and that legs arose from these highly modified lobe fins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial41_Fig10.jpg" title="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early vertebrates arose in the oceans, where desiccation was not a problem. However, with the invasion of land about 365 million years ago, ancient vertebrates had another problem to face; namely, water loss. This was similar to the problem faced by land plants. The vertebrates solved this problem by evolving with a toughened egg that was resistant to drying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;In reptiles, birds and mammals, the &lt;strong&gt;amniotic egg&lt;/strong&gt; has several unique features (e.g., a specialized membrane system that has many functions, including gas exchange and the transfer of vital nutrients to the developing embryo). The amniotic egg derived its name from the &lt;strong&gt;amnion&lt;/strong&gt;, a membrane that houses amniotic fluid, which bathes and protects the embryo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Mammals&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial41_Fig11.jpg" title="" /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This armadillo (left) belongs to the vertebrate class Mammalia, as does this panther (below right. &lt;strong&gt;Mammals&lt;/strong&gt; can be distinguished from the other vertebrates on the basis of several characteristics. All mammals have hair that functions (to some degree) in insulation, &lt;strong&gt;mammary glands&lt;/strong&gt; for milk production, and internal fertilization. Most mammals develop in the maternal uterus and are nourished by nutrients diffusing from mother to child across an organ called the &lt;strong&gt;placenta&lt;/strong&gt;. Young &lt;strong&gt;marsupial&lt;/strong&gt; mammals complete their development in a maternal pouch; marsupials include kangaroos, opossum, and tasmanian devils. A few animals (e.g., the echidna and the platypus) are &lt;strong&gt;monotremes&lt;/strong&gt;, which are mammals that actually lay eggs and lack nipples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial41_Fig12.jpg" title="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Human Evolution&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial41_Fig13.jpg" title="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humans are vertebrates, and we are subject to the same evolutionary principles that govern all life on the planet. However, we are a relatively new species. Although our hominid ancestors might date back to 2 million years ago, modern humans (those that learned agriculture and demonstrated tool use and complex social structure) date back to a mere 100,000 years ago. While this may sound like a long time ago, consider that this represents only 5000 generations. This is not long on an evolutionary scale. This figure shows the major migration paths prior to 10,000 years ago, and all of us can trace our own ancestry back to one or more of these migrations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="0" src="http://c.gigcount.com/wildfire/IMP/CXNID=2000002.0NXC/bT*xJmx*PTEzMTE3NDM3NjgxNzgmcHQ9MTMxMTc*Mzc3MTAyOSZwPTIwNjQyMSZkPWIyMTYxNzA4Jmc9MiZvPTk2NjhhNGRlZDA4/NDRmNzlhYTY1ZTI4N2RlOTA2Y2E4Jm9mPTA=.gif" style="visibility: hidden; width: 0px; height: 0px;" width="0" /&gt;&lt;object data="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2161708" height="480" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="640"&gt;&lt;param name="quality" value="high" /&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2161708" /&gt;&lt;param name="wmode" value="transparent" /&gt;&lt;embed height="480" hspace="10" quality="high" src="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2161708" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" vspace="10" width="640" wmode="transparent"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Summary&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tutorial presented the phylum Chordata and the subphyla Urochordata, Cephalochordata, and Vertebrata. Individuals within the phylum all have a notochord, a dorsal nerve cord, pharyngeal slits, and a postanal tail. The notochord may or may not persist in the adult, and the pharyngeal slits are modified in various ways in the different groups. The Urochordates are the probable ancestors of vertebrates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vertebrates have a dorsal nerve cord that is protected by a vertebral column, and the anterior portion of this nerve cord is protected by a cranium. There are several basal features found in vertebrates, and they are used to distinguish the lineages. The presence or absence of jaws, teeth, lungs, legs, amniotic eggs, and hair are more derived features that arose in succession, and they give the vertebrates the diversity seen today.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

&lt;h2&gt;Introduction and Goals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial37_lion.jpg" title="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tutorial will begin our discussion of Kingdom Animalia. First, we will discuss what makes an organism an animal. Second, we will focus on some major milestones in the evolution of animals. Third, we will conclude with a discussion of animal development (from a single-cell zygote through a specialized embryo). The next four tutorials will focus on animal diversity. By the end of this tutorial you should have an understanding of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The general characteristics of all animals&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The evolution of animals&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The major branch points in the phylogeny of animal evolution&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The basic steps involved in animal development&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;What are Animals?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial37_Fig2.jpg" title="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all agree that a cat is an animal, but what is it that makes it an animal? Why is a sponge an animal? Why are sponges and cats placed in the same kingdom? You might think that some corals look more like plants, and that sponges don&amp;#39;t look like much of anything; at least, not like anything alive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some basic features that are found in all of the members of the kingdom Animalia. In general, animals are all motile, heterotrophic, and multicellular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial37_Fig3.jpg" title="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Motility refers to the ability to move and/or affect motion in one&amp;#39;s vicinity. For example, adult sponges don&amp;#39;t move from place to place, but they can manipulate their cells to bring food to themselves. Also, while some animals are sessile as adults, all animals exhibit movement from place to place sometime in their development. For example, sponges and corals are motile as &lt;strong&gt;larvae&lt;/strong&gt; (the very early stages of embryonic development) and sessile as adults. A myriad of adaptations for motility are observed in animals, and some of these will be addressed in this tutorial. The image on the right depicts the development of a sponge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Animals are ingestive heterotrophs (they ingest nutrients). Unlike plants, who store their food as starch, animals store their food as glycogen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial37_Fig4.jpg" title="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Animals have muscle tissue and nervous tissue. These tissues can range from being indistinct (as observed in sponges) to being highly complex (as observed in vertebrates). The coordination between muscle tissue and nervous tissue can result in very specialized movements (e.g., food procurement, mate pursuit, predator avoidance).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;When Did Animals Arise?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fossil records support the hypothesis that the first animals appeared approximately 700 million years ago, but some researchers think that animals might have evolved much earlier. Penn State researcher, Blair Hedges, has estimated that animals may have arisen 1.6 billion years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The Origin of Animals&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial37_Fig5.jpg" title="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first animals likely originated from a colonial protist similar to the &lt;strong&gt;choanoflagellate&lt;/strong&gt; shown here. Choanoflagellates have many of the basic features observed in animals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that this colony of individual cells is anchored to a substrate, and that its flagellum sweeps food into a cell for ingestion. The cell can then transfer the food to other cells. While this scenario demonstrates little specialization, it is a very primitive form of multicellularity and ingestive heterotrophy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Animal Evolution: The Big Picture&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial37_Fig1_0.jpg" title="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This figure illustrates the major branch points in the &lt;strong&gt;phylogeny&lt;/strong&gt; (evolutionary history) of animal diversity. Study this figure; you will see it again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of these bifurcations (branch points) is a discrete dichotomous (division of an ancestral line into two equal diverging branches) point. For example, an organism is either a parazoan or a eumetazoan; eumetazoans are either radiata or bilateria (to be discussed). Each bifurcation marks an ancestral character state that is thought to clearly separate the two major lineages. The higher in the tree, the more derived (or more recently evolved) is that particular character.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="0" src="http://c.gigcount.com/wildfire/IMP/CXNID=2000002.0NXC/bT*xJmx*PTEzMTEyNTk3ODQxMjUmcHQ9MTMxMTI1OTc4NzcxMiZwPTIwNjQyMSZkPWIyMTU*MzAwJmc9MiZvPTk2NjhhNGRlZDA4/NDRmNzlhYTY1ZTI4N2RlOTA2Y2E4Jm9mPTA=.gif" style="visibility: hidden; width: 0px; height: 0px;" width="0" /&gt;&lt;object data="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2154300" height="480" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="640"&gt;&lt;param name="quality" value="high" /&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2154300" /&gt;&lt;param name="wmode" value="transparent" /&gt;&lt;embed height="480" hspace="10" quality="high" src="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2154300" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" vspace="10" width="640" wmode="transparent"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Parazoa Versus Eumetazoa&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial37_Fig1.jpg" title="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first dichotomous branch point of the phylogenetic tree of Kingdom Animalia separates organisms that do not have true tissues from those with true tissues. A &lt;strong&gt;tissue&lt;/strong&gt; is an aggregate of cells that performs a function. &lt;strong&gt;Parazoans&lt;/strong&gt; lack true tissues, whereas &lt;strong&gt;eumetazoans&lt;/strong&gt; have true tissues. There has been some debate about whether parazoans, namely the sponges, should even be considered animals. Eumetazoans have distinct collections of cells that are arranged for specific purposes. Because tissue organization is the first bifurcation, it is the most basic criteria for assigning animals to phyla.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial37_Fig3.jpg" title="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes it is easiest to see similarities between groups at the larval stage. It is on this basis, the similarity between sponge and eumetazoa development, that sponges are classified as animals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The Eumetazoans: Radial Versus Bilateral Symmetry&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial37_Fig1.jpg" title="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second dichotomous branch point of the phylogenetic tree of Kingdom Animalia separates the eumetazoans with &lt;strong&gt;radial symmetry&lt;/strong&gt; (the &lt;strong&gt;radiata&lt;/strong&gt;) from those with &lt;strong&gt;bilateral symmetry&lt;/strong&gt; (the &lt;strong&gt;bilateria&lt;/strong&gt;). In organisms that possess radial symmetry, multiple mirror planes can be drawn (think of a wheel). In organisms that possess bilateral symmetry, only one mirror plane can be drawn along a single axis. For example, humans have only one mirror plane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another pivotal characteristic of the radiata is that they are &lt;strong&gt;diploblastic&lt;/strong&gt;. Diploblastic organisms only have two embryonic tissue layers: &lt;strong&gt;endoderm&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;ectoderm&lt;/strong&gt;. The endoderm gives rise to the lining of the digestive tract, and in higher animals, the liver and lungs. The ectoderm gives rise to the animal&amp;#39;s outer covering and, in some phyla, the central nervous system. The bilateria are &lt;strong&gt;triploblastic&lt;/strong&gt; and begin life with three distinct tissue layers: endoderm, &lt;strong&gt;mesoderm&lt;/strong&gt; and ectoderm. The mesoderm gives rise to the muscles and most of the internal organs. We will discuss these tissue types more in the following tutorials. Note that these are embryonic distinctions; this does not mean that these organisms will end up with only two or three tissue types. Some animals that exhibit radial symmetry as adults have been placed in the bilateria. Why might this be the case? That is, do you think an adult morphology might differ significantly from the larval morphology of the same animal?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the radiata tend to be sessile as adults, whereas the bilateria are motile. We will discuss this distinction later in the tutorials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Acoelomates Versus Coelomates&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/courses/biol110/sites/edu.courses.biol110/files/images/Tutorial37_Fig1.jpg" title="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third major bifurcation of the phylogenetic tree of Kingdom Animalia distinguishes animals by whether or not they have a body cavity. &lt;strong&gt;Coelomates&lt;/strong&gt; have a body cavity, whereas &lt;strong&gt;acoelomates&lt;/strong&gt; do not. Note, there is also a distinction made between &lt;strong&gt;pseudocoelomates&lt;/strong&gt; and &quot;true coelomates&quot; (discussed in the next section). A &lt;strong&gt;coelom&lt;/strong&gt; is a fluid-lined space (body cavity) that separates the gut from the outer body wall. However, don&amp;#39;t confuse &quot;body cavity&quot; with &quot;gut&quot; because they are not the same thing. For example, our intestines are suspended within our body cavities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an acoelomate gut, muscle contractions are not buffered by a fluid-filled body cavity; therefore, all forces generated during a contraction are transmitted throughout the animal and affect all internal organs. The coelom serves as a mechanical buffer in coelomates; it helps protect internal organs from shock. Fortunately for us, we can run and jump without bouncing our heart and lungs around too much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Pseudocoelomates Versus Coelomates&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial37_Fig6.jpg" title="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The figure on the right illustrates the body plans of the bilateria. Note the acoelomate, pseudocoelomate and coelomate conditions. Do you see that pseudocoelomates (e.g., nematodes) have a body cavity that is only partially lined by mesoderm-derived tissue? Keep in mind that mesoderm gives rise to muscle (as well as other things). Think about the coelomate versus pseudocoelomate state in respect to muscle distribution and ask yourself if you think a pseudocoelomate can move its body independent of the gut cavity?.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/courses/biol110/sites/edu.courses.biol110/files/images/Tutorial37_Fig1.jpg" title="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Protostomes Versus Deuterostomes&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last major branch point of the phylogenetic tree of Kingdom Animalia distinguishes coelomates based on the fundamental aspects of their development. &lt;strong&gt;Protostome&lt;/strong&gt; coelomates include the mollusks, annelids and arthropods, whereas &lt;strong&gt;deuterostome&lt;/strong&gt; coelomates include the echinoderms and chordates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the main differences between the two is the origin of their gut. In protostomes the mouth develops first, whereas in deuterostomes the anus develops first. &quot;Stoma&quot; is Greek for &quot;mouth,&quot; and &quot;protos&quot; and &quot;deuteros&quot; are &quot;first&quot; and &quot;second,&quot; respectively. We will discuss more about the differences between protostomes and deuterostomes later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Animal Development&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the kingdom Animalia, organisms are primarily grouped according to their development. Developmental continuity throughout the kingdom is impressive. That is, two animals can look and behave very similarly when in a young developmental stage but be very different as adults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Development&lt;/strong&gt; is defined as those processes that are irreversible and occur from zygote formation to death. The word &quot;irreversible&quot; is key and limits the definition of development. &lt;strong&gt;Cellular differentiation&lt;/strong&gt; is defined as how a cell diverges from its early morphology into a more specialized morphology, in an irreversible manner. &lt;strong&gt;Morphogenesis&lt;/strong&gt; is how an organism&amp;#39;s &quot;shape&quot; is acquired, and &lt;strong&gt;pattern formation&lt;/strong&gt; describes how cells, tissues, and organs are arranged in an organism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial37_Fig7.jpg" title="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of a diploid organism begins with fertilization. Shortly after the gametes unite to form the single-cell zygote, cell division commences. These early cell divisions are called &lt;strong&gt;cleavage&lt;/strong&gt;. Cell division is not a random process, and various patterns of cleavage are observed. In some cases (e.g., protostomes), a spiral pattern is observed in the first few cell divisions, whereas in other cases (e.g., deuterostomes), the &lt;strong&gt;blastomeres&lt;/strong&gt; (early cells) assume a radial configuration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;Besides having different types of cleavage, the embryonic cells of protostomes and deuterostomes have different potentials for future development. Animals that have a radial cleavage pattern (deuterostomes) have blastomeres that can potentially form all tissue types (i.e., their developmental fate is not predetermined); hence, this type of early development is termed &lt;strong&gt;indeterminate development&lt;/strong&gt;. On the other hand, those animals with spiral patterns (protostomes) have blastomeres whose developmental fate is determined very early; hence, their development is termed &lt;strong&gt;determinate development&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Totipotency&lt;/strong&gt; is the capability of certain embryonic cells to form any type of adult cell. Hence, the early embryonic cells (blastomeres) of deuterostomes can be totipotent. Totipotency is required for two individuals to develop from a single zygote that is split in half (e.g., identical twins, also called monozygotic twins). Totipotency is typically lost during early embryo development, but scientists can reprogram some cells to become totipotent once again in the laboratory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial37_Dolly_the_sheep.jpg" title="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dolly the sheep was cloned using the nucleus from a mammary (breast) cell that was rendered totipotent in the lab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Stem Cells and Development&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the early deuterostome embryo, each cell has the potential to form a complete embryo, i.e., they are totipotent. As development proceeds some embryonic cells begin expressing new genes and at the same time they lose the ability to form all possible cell types, but they still retain the ability to differentiate into a subset of cells; these cells are said to be pluripotent. In the popular press, both totipotent and pluripotent cells can be referred to as stem cells. Understanding how stem cells maintain their totipotency (and how their derivitives lose this character) is an important area of research in developmental biology. Medical researchers are also interested in this area as it may provide new treatment options for patients that have irrepairable damage to certain tissues. However, ethical questions have arisen regarding the use of human embryos to obtain totipotent stem cells and consequently research, particularly in in this country, has limited the widespread acceptance of this research. In 2007, researchers reported on the production of pluripotent cells from highly differentiated human fibroblasts (a lighly differentated cell) and this approach holds the promise to further advance stem cell research without the need of human embryos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;From Zygote to Induction&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial37_Fig9.jpg" title="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The figure on the right illustrates how the first collection of cells (blastomeres) form a hollow ball, the &lt;strong&gt;blastula&lt;/strong&gt;. However, blastulae aren&amp;#39;t always hollow spheres; they can be flattened (e.g., the blastulae of birds and mammals). From this hollow embryonic stage, cells start migrating into the interior and simultaneously begin to differentiate. This process is called &lt;strong&gt;gastrulation&lt;/strong&gt;. During gastrulation, cells change their developmental pathway. The &lt;strong&gt;gastrula&lt;/strong&gt; stage, in which tissue types arise, is only observed in the eumetazoans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the conclusion of gastrulation, the endoderm, ectoderm and mesoderm appear. In addition, the &lt;strong&gt;archenteron&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;blastopore&lt;/strong&gt; arise. The archenteron is a clear pouch of cells created by the invagination during gastrulation, and the blastopore is the opening to the pouch. (In the simplest scenario, think of pushing in on a balloon with your finger; the area that your finger tip forms (the pouch) represents the archenteron, and its opening represents the blastopore.) The blastopore&amp;#39;s fate is determined by the type of organism. If the blastopore gives rise to a mouth, it is a protostome. If the blastopore gives rise to an anus, it is a deuterostome. The &lt;strong&gt;blastocoel&lt;/strong&gt; is the first cavity that forms. (Once again, don&amp;#39;t confuse &quot;cavity&quot; with &quot;gut.&quot;) The archenteron is the second cavity that forms; the archenteron is the cavity that will give rise to the gut in coelomates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the figure above, the cells that migrate inward are a different color; they express a different set of genes. Gastrulation, the movement of surface cells inward, is accompanied by &lt;strong&gt;induction&lt;/strong&gt; (the process by which certain embryonic cells trigger the differentiation of other embryonic cells).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Summary&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="0" src="http://c.gigcount.com/wildfire/IMP/CXNID=2000002.0NXC/bT*xJmx*PTEzMTEyNTk5NDI1ODQmcHQ9MTMxMTI1OTk*NjkwMyZwPTIwNjQyMSZkPWIyMTU*MzAzJmc9MiZvPTk2NjhhNGRlZDA4/NDRmNzlhYTY1ZTI4N2RlOTA2Y2E4Jm9mPTA=.gif" style="visibility: hidden; width: 0px; height: 0px;" width="0" /&gt;&lt;object data="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2154303" height="480" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="640"&gt;&lt;param name="quality" value="high" /&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2154303" /&gt;&lt;param name="wmode" value="transparent" /&gt;&lt;embed height="480" hspace="10" quality="high" src="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2154303" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" vspace="10" width="640" wmode="transparent"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tutorial began our discussion of Kingdom Animalia. Animals have been around for at least 700 million years, and during this time they have diversified to a remarkable degree. Likely, the ancestor of all animals was a colonial protist. In examining the phylogenetic tree, keep in mind that there are major dichotomous characters that occur at each branch point. In many instances these characters are based on the development of animals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eumetazoan development (as with other sexually reproducing, multicellular eukaryotes) begins with fertilization. The zygote then undergoes a series of cell divisions to produce a mass of cells that has some hollow character (the parazoans do not follow this type of embryology). The first tissue to form is the blastoderm, and this young tissue surrounds the blastocoel. In the next step (gastrulation), cells migrate inward and begin to differentiate into endoderm. Thus, gastrulation marks the embryonic stage where additional tissue types form. In the case of diploblastic animals, there are only two tissue types (ectoderm and endoderm), whereas triploblastic animals have three tissue types (ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm). During gastrulation, the primitive gut also forms from the archenteron.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depending on the species, a second body cavity (coelom) can form. Thus, animals can be characterized as lacking a second body cavity (acoelomates), having a coelom that is incompletely lined with mesoderm (psuedocoelomates), or having a coelom that is completely lined with mesoderm (coelomates). As we survey the various phyla of Kingdom Animalia, keep in mind the relationship between these major character traits and their relationship with animal development.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

		&lt;/tr&gt;
	&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Introduction and Goals&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial38_Fig1.jpg" title="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tutorial will begin our discussion of specific phyla within the kingdom Animalia, beginning with the parazoans and continuing through the acoelomates. As we introduce new topics in animal classification, keep in mind the phylogenetic tree of animals. Also, think about how form (morphology) relates to function. That is, how does an animal&amp;#39;s shape and organization affect what it is able to do? This tutorial will provide a more detailed look at the first three major branch points in the phylogenetic tree of animals. By the end of this tutorial you should have a basic understanding of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;How specific organisms coincide with the first three major branch points in the evolution of animals&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Characteristics of organisms in the phyla Porifera, Cnidaria, and Platyhelminthes&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;How certain flatworms can cause disease in humans&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Parazoa: The Phylum Porifera (Sponges)&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial38_Fig2.jpg" title="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first dichotomous branch point in the phylogenetic tree of animals distinguishes between the parazoans and the eumetazoans; organisms lacking true tissues versus those that have truly specialized tissues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;The first phylum we&amp;#39;ll discuss is Phylum Porifera, which includes the sponges. As mentioned in the &lt;a href="https://onlinecourses.science.psu.edu/bio110/node/87" title="Tutorial 37 - Animals I - An Overview of Phylogeny and Diversity"&gt;first tutorial on animals&lt;/a&gt;, some scientists still question whether sponges are really animals and, if so, are they really individuals or colonies of individuals? While sponges are composed of a loose collection of cells, they actually lack the true tissue-level organization that is characteristic of eumetazoans. Given that they appear to be a mass of relatively unspecialized cells, one might wonder if sponges are actually individuals or colonies of individuals. There is evidence that supports both choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Sponges: Structure&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial38_Fig3.jpg" title="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial38_Fig4.jpg" title="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sponges have an epidermis composed of tightly packed cells, underneath which lies a gelatinous matrix and a few specialized cell types that surround a central cavity termed the &lt;strong&gt;spongocoel&lt;/strong&gt;. The spongocoel is connected to the outside via an opening called the &lt;strong&gt;osculum&lt;/strong&gt;. The spongocoel is lined with &lt;strong&gt;choanocytes&lt;/strong&gt;, which are cells that have a central flagellum and a sticky collar that surrounds the flagellum. Water is drawn into the spongocoel through the osculum, and food particles in the water may pass the sponge&amp;#39;s choanocytes. The flagellum of a choanocyte pulls in food particles, which get stuck in the sticky mucus of the collar and are picked up by amoebocytes. Amoebocytes are mobile and can transport nutrients throughout the body of the sponge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Sponges: Development&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial38_Fig5.jpg" title="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A sponge has an embryonic form similar to a blastula because it is hollow. One-half of this embryonic form is flagellated, hence the embryo is free-swimming. This hollow, half-flagellated ball will eventually settle and become stuck to a substrate. The flagellated half will invert, and the point where it inverts will become the osculum. The space created during inversion will become the spongocoel. Note that the adult sponge is sessile, whereas the embryonic form is motile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial38_Fig6.jpg" title="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we mainly use synthetic sponges, natural sponges are still sold for household use. The image on the right illustrates how sponges are sold at a market in Crete, Greece.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="0" src="http://c.gigcount.com/wildfire/IMP/CXNID=2000002.0NXC/bT*xJmx*PTEzMTEyNjAyNzkzOTgmcHQ9MTMxMTI2MDMyOTU*NCZwPTIwNjQyMSZkPWIyMTU1NDkxJmc9MiZvPTk2NjhhNGRlZDA4/NDRmNzlhYTY1ZTI4N2RlOTA2Y2E4Jm9mPTA=.gif" style="visibility: hidden; width: 0px; height: 0px;" width="0" /&gt;&lt;object data="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2155491" height="480" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="640"&gt;&lt;param name="quality" value="high" /&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2155491" /&gt;&lt;param name="wmode" value="transparent" /&gt;&lt;embed height="480" hspace="10" quality="high" src="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2155491" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" vspace="10" width="640" wmode="transparent"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Radiata: The Phylum Cnidaria&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial38_Fig1.jpg" title="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second dichotomous branch point of the phylogenetic tree distinguishes between the radiata and the bilateria. The radiata include organisms that have a radial morphology. The radiata include Phylum Ctenophora and Phylum Cnidaria (sometimes referred to as Phylum Coelenterata). Examples of &lt;strong&gt;cnidarians&lt;/strong&gt; include jellies (often called jellyfish), corals (image below on the right), and sea anemones. Some cnidarians are bioluminescent (radiate light), and some (e.g., the Portuguese Man-of-War) can sting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial38_Fig7.jpg" title="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All cnidarians are able to contract and expand for movement and for reproduction. Additionally, they all obtain and digest nutrients in an organized cellular manner. Hence, they all have true tissues and are placed in the Eumetazoa. In addition, cnidarians have an unsophisticated &lt;strong&gt;gastrovascular cavity&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial38_Fig8.jpg" title="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cnidaria have two general body plans and these are depicted in the image on the right: the &lt;strong&gt;polyp&lt;/strong&gt; and the &lt;strong&gt;medusa&lt;/strong&gt;. The polyp form is sessile, anchored to a substrate. The medusa form is motile. Note that the mouth and anus are actually a single structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial38_Fig9.jpg" title="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recall from our last tutorial, that the radiata have only two embryonic tissue layers. Specifically, they lack mesoderm (the tissue that gives rise to structures like muscles in triploblastic organisms). As a consequence, they lack the level of sophisticated movement seen in triploblastic organisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cnidarians also have &lt;strong&gt;cnidocytes&lt;/strong&gt; (specialized cells that function in defense and the capture of prey); cnidocytes contain organelles called &lt;strong&gt;cnidae&lt;/strong&gt;, which are able to evert. Cnidae that sting are called &lt;strong&gt;nematocysts&lt;/strong&gt;. These nematocysts (shown at the right) can immobilize fish for capture, and they can also be used for defense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Cnidarian Classes&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are three classes in the Phylum Cnidaria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Class Hydrozoa includes hydras, &lt;em&gt;Obelia&lt;/em&gt;, and the infamous Portuguese Man-of-War (an organism noted for its potent sting). Most hydrozoans exist in the polyp and medusa forms. For example, &lt;em&gt;Obelia&lt;/em&gt; exists as an asexually reproducing polyp that alternates with a sexually reproducing medusa form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial38_Fig10.jpg" title="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Class Scyphozoa includes the jellies (or jellyfish). Scyphozoans exist predominantly in the medusa form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial38_Fig11.jpg" title="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Class Anthozoa includes sea anemones, corals, and sea fans. Anthozoans exist only in the polyp form. In our discussion of [protist diversity], we addressed the symbioses between reef-building corals and the dinoflagellates. Recall that in these relationships, corals provide housing and protection for the protists, and the dinoflagellates provide food for the corals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Members of all of the cnidarian classes can respond to external stimuli and can use stinging nematocysts for prey capture and defense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial38_Fig12.jpg" title="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examine the life cycle of &lt;em&gt;Obelia&lt;/em&gt; and note that the medusa form is that which produces gametes. Once fertilization occurs, the animal undergoes development and a free-swimming planular larva results. The planula settles and develops into a sessile polyp that can develop asexually via budding. Polyps can differentiate into what appears like a colony in that the distal appendages are specialized for feeding or reproduction. The reproductive polyp produces a medusa and the cycle continues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Bilateria&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We now turn our attention to those animals that have true tissues and bilateral symmetry, the bilateria. Recall from the previous tutorial, the bilateria have a single plane of symmetry. In tandem with this single plane of symmetry is the development of advanced sensory material in the &lt;strong&gt;anterior&lt;/strong&gt; (front) part of the body. The eyes of &lt;strong&gt;planaria&lt;/strong&gt; lack the resolution of our own eyes, however, they do detect light. They are connected to a primitive brain. (Simple brains that contain a low number of neurons are sometimes referred to as &lt;strong&gt;ganglia&lt;/strong&gt;.) The eyes are positioned to perceive new surroundings as the organism moves into new areas. This trend toward a concentration of sensory and nervous material is termed &lt;strong&gt;cephalization&lt;/strong&gt;. Remember, the bilateria are triploblastic, possessing a third embryonic tissue layer (mesoderm).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bilateria include acoelomates, pseudocoelomates, and coelomates. Acoelomates will be addr&lt;strong&gt;trematodes&lt;/strong&gt; essed in this tutorial, and the other two will be covered in future tutorials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Acoelomates: The Phylum Platyhelminthes (Flatworms)&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial38_Fig13.jpg" title="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our discussion of the bilateria, we begin with those organisms that do not have a body cavity (the acoelomates). These organisms do not have a fluid-filled internal body cavity, but instead, have a relatively solid body mass. The phylum Platyhelminthes is divided into four classes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial38_Fig14.jpg" title="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Members of the class Turbellaria include carnivorous &lt;strong&gt;flatworms&lt;/strong&gt; (e.g., planarians). Cephalization occurs in the form of eyespots and paired ganglia, as well as an actual nervous system. These features are characteristic of the level of complexity observed in the bilateria. This class consists predominantly of free-living (nonparasitic) representatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Members of the class Monogenea are all parasitic (as is the &lt;em&gt;Polystomoides&lt;/em&gt; species depicted at the right). Six suckers are used to suck digested material from their hosts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;Members of the class Trematoda are also parasitic. Some exhibit very complex life cycles. Examples include the various species of blood flukes in the family &lt;em&gt;Schistosoma&lt;/em&gt;, and the liver fluke depicted at the right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial38_Fig15.jpg" title="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Members of the class Cestoidea are also parasitic, and include the &lt;strong&gt;tapeworms&lt;/strong&gt;. Tapeworms consist of a &lt;strong&gt;scolex&lt;/strong&gt; (head), which has hooks for attaching to their host and suckers for extracting food. The majority of their body is actually a series of &lt;strong&gt;proglottids&lt;/strong&gt;, which basically are repeating units packed with sexual organs. &lt;em&gt;Taenia serialis&lt;/em&gt; (right) was recovered from a dog; one can see the hooks in the center of its head, surrounded by four suckers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Platyhelminthes and Disease&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a assets/Tutorial38_Fig16.gif"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/courses/biol110/sites/edu.courses.biol110/files/images/Tutorial38_Fig16.gif" title="" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a assets/Tutorial38_Fig17.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/courses/biol110/sites/edu.courses.biol110/files/images/Tutorial38_Fig17.jpg" title="" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The life cycle of &lt;em&gt;Schistosoma mansoni&lt;/em&gt;, from the phylum Platyhelminthes, is complicated, involving multiple symbioses. The image at the right shows a copulating pair of male and female &lt;em&gt;Schistosoma&lt;/em&gt; (blood flukes). Sexual reproduction occurs inside a vertebrate host (e.g., a human).&lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial38_Fig18.jpg" title="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;Fertilized eggs are eliminated in the feces of the first host. The larvae that emerge parasitize a second host, a snail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;The flukes reproduce asexually within the snails, and their second-stage larvae emerge to infect yet another vertebrate host.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial38_Fig19.jpg" title="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who suffer from schistosomiasis exhibit various symptoms, including a distended abdomen (like that seen above). Other symptoms include pain and extreme diarrhea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial38_Fig20.jpg" title="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People that work in, or around, freshwater contaminated with human feces are at risk for harboring &lt;em&gt;Schistosoma&lt;/em&gt; and contracting schistosomiasis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="0" src="http://c.gigcount.com/wildfire/IMP/CXNID=2000002.0NXC/bT*xJmx*PTEzMTEyNjA1MDI4NzImcHQ9MTMxMTI2MDUwNTc5OSZwPTIwNjQyMSZkPWIyMTU1NTA*Jmc9MiZvPTk2NjhhNGRlZDA4/NDRmNzlhYTY1ZTI4N2RlOTA2Y2E4Jm9mPTA=.gif" style="visibility: hidden; width: 0px; height: 0px;" width="0" /&gt;&lt;object data="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2155504" height="480" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="640"&gt;&lt;param name="quality" value="high" /&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2155504" /&gt;&lt;param name="wmode" value="transparent" /&gt;&lt;embed height="480" hspace="10" quality="high" src="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2155504" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" vspace="10" width="640" wmode="transparent"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Summary&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tutorial examined the more basal dichotomous branches in the kingdom Animalia. Be sure that you understand the rationale behind the taxonomic scheme for animals. It will be important for you to know what a coelomate is, what the coelom represents, and how the coelom arises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Phylum Porifera was discussed. These animals can be considered individuals and colonies because they have features of both. In fact, there are some biologists who argue that they really aren&amp;#39;t animals; however, they do have animal characteristics (they are multicellular, motile, ingestive heterotrophs), which is why they are placed in the kingdom Animalia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phylum Cnidaria is comprised of simple animals, including the common jellyfishes. These animals do have true tissues, however, they possess only two embryonic tissues; hence, they have a diploblastic mode of development. The major body forms observed in this phylum are the polyp and the medusa. In many cnidarians, these forms alternate during the life cycle, but in Class Hydrozoa the polyp is prominent, whereas in Class Scyphozoa the medusa is prominent. Members of Class Anthozoa do not have a medusa stage. (This class includes the coral reef-building animals that form symbioses with dinoflagellates.) Think about these differences in terms of evolution because small changes in the expression of developmental genes can control when, and for how long, a given form is represented. Recall that we discussed the role of heterochrony in Tutorial 13 on macroevolution. Within Phylum Cnidaria, there are differences in the timing of the polyp versus the medusa stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bilateria branch of Kingdom Animalia was also discussed. Keep in mind, the character trait bilateral symmetry is observed in animals that actively move through their environments. Bilaterally symmetrical animals not only have a single plane of symmetry, their sensory and cephalic areas are usually displaced toward the anterior part of the animal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Phylum Platyhelminthes is composed of animals that are commonly referred to as flatworms. These animals are triploblastic and show an organ level of complexity. Although many members of this phylum are free-living, some are parasitic and cause major health problems in some parts of the world.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <title>Animals III - Pseudocoelomates, Mollusks, and Annelids</title>
    <body>&lt;h2&gt;Terms&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should have a working knowledge of the following terms:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
	&lt;tbody&gt;
		&lt;tr&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;
				&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;annelid&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;bivalve&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;cephalopod&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;foot&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;gastropod&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;hydrostatic skeleton&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;invertebrate&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;mantle&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;mantle cavity&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;/ul&gt;
			&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;
				&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;mollusk&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;nematode&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;nephridium (pl. nephridia)&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;radula&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;roundworm&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;segmentation&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;septa&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;visceral mass&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;/ul&gt;
			&lt;/td&gt;
		&lt;/tr&gt;
	&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Introduction and Goals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial39_Fig1.jpg" title="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tutorial continues our discussion of the major features of animal evolution, concentrating on the bilateria. Previously we introduced three phyla: Porifera, Cnidaria, and Platyhelminthes. These groupings encompass representatives of the parazoa, radiata, and bilateria, respectively. We will begin by distinguishing among the organisms with body cavities, the pseudocoelomates and true coelomates. By the end of this tutorial you should have a better understanding of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;How specific organisms coincide with the major branch points in the phylogenetic tree in the evolution of animals&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Characteristics of organisms in Phyla Nematoda, Mollusca, and Annelida&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;How certain roundworms cause diseases in humans&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Coelomates and Pseudocoelomates&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial39_Fig2.jpg" title="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The figure on the right illustrates the three basic body plans encountered in the bilateria: the acoelomates (e.g., flatworms, flukes, and tapeworms), the pseudocoelomates (e.g., roundworms, pinworms, and hookworms), and the coelomates (e.g., snails, clams, octopuses, earthworms, and leeches). Recall, pseudocoelomates differ from coelomates in that their body cavities are not completely lined by mesoderm-derived tissue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Pseudocoelomates: The Phylum Nematoda&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial39_Fig2.jpg" title="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Roundworms&lt;/strong&gt; are pseudocoelomates that belong to the phylum Nematoda. This extremely diverse phylum includes some highly beneficial soil worms, as well as some notorious pests and parasites. The highly pressurized pseudocoelom of these animals can function as a &lt;strong&gt;hydrostatic skeleton&lt;/strong&gt;, which can be useful in drilling through soil or a host&amp;#39;s body tissue. Annelids, cnidarians, and flatworms also have hydrostatic skeletons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial39_dioctophyme-adult.jpg" title="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;Giant kidney worms are able to parasitize many mammals, including humans. The female worms can grow up to 5 feet long. The worms live in the kidney of a vertebrate host, and their eggs leave the body in the host&amp;#39;s urine. From there, the eggs might be consumed by an aquatic worm (from the phylum Annelida). Juvenile kidney worms can be transferred to fish or amphibians; if these secondary hosts are consumed by a vertebrate, the infection cycle is completed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial39_dioctophyma_in_kidney.gif" title="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given how large these worms can become, it is not surprising that these parasites can cause extensive damage. Note how shrunken the asterisked kidney is, and also note the worms occupying the kidney in the yellow square. The accompanying loss of kidney function can be deadly if the parasites are not detected and removed surgically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure. 5  Ascaris lumbricoides.  Roundworms that can infect the human intestines." src="assets/Tutorial39_ascaris.jpg" title="Figure. 5  Ascaris lumbricoides.  Roundworms that can infect the human intestines." /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is estimated that 25% of the world&amp;#39;s population is infected with these roundworms (&lt;em&gt;Ascaris lumbricoides&lt;/em&gt;). This particular mass of worms was passed from the intestine of a human. The ruler at the side is 3 cm long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure. 6  A hookworm's mouth." src="assets/Tutorial39_hookworms.jpg" title="Figure. 6  A hookworm's mouth." /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other &lt;strong&gt;nematodes&lt;/strong&gt; include pinworms, hookworms, and &lt;em&gt;Trichinella spiralis&lt;/em&gt; (the causative agent of trichinosis). This hookworm mouth (right) reveals how these worms are able to latch on to a host and penetrate the host&amp;#39;s intestines and other organs. Symptoms of helminth infection include diarrhea, anemia, pneumonia, as well as physical and mental retardation. World Health Organization data suggest that 1/3 of the world&amp;#39;s population is at risk of infection, with one in six people already infected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="0" src="http://c.gigcount.com/wildfire/IMP/CXNID=2000002.0NXC/bT*xJmx*PTEzMTEyODUyMTI*NjQmcHQ9MTMxMTI4NTIxNDUwNiZwPTIwNjQyMSZkPWIyMTU1NTU4Jmc9MiZvPTk2NjhhNGRlZDA4/NDRmNzlhYTY1ZTI4N2RlOTA2Y2E4Jm9mPTA=.gif" style="visibility: hidden; width: 0px; height: 0px;" width="0" /&gt;&lt;object data="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2155558" height="480" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="640"&gt;&lt;param name="quality" value="high" /&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2155558" /&gt;&lt;param name="wmode" value="transparent" /&gt;&lt;embed height="480" hspace="10" quality="high" src="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2155558" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" vspace="10" width="640" wmode="transparent"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Coelomates: Protostomes versus Deuterostomes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial39_Fig1.jpg" title="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial39_Fig7.jpg" title="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The true coelomates are categorized as either protostomes or deuterostomes. The distinction is based on differences in their early cell cleavage, coelom formation, and the fate of the blastopore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;As mentioned earlier in &lt;a href="https://online.science.psu.edu/biol110_sandbox_2381/node/8980"&gt;Animals I&lt;/a&gt;, , one of the main differences between the two is in the origin of their guts. As shown in the bottom of this figure, the mouth develops first in protostomes, whereas in deuterostomes the anus develops first (the mouth forms secondarily). This distinction may seem irrelevant, but from an evolutionary standpoint it is a distinct bifurcation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protostomes also have spiral patterns and determinate development during their first cell divisions, whereas deuterostomes have radial patterns and indeterminate development. Deuterostomes will be discussed later. Next we&amp;#39;ll begin our discussion of the protostomes in the phylum Mollusca.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Protostome Coelomates: The Phylum Mollusca&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial39_Fig8.jpg" title="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial39_Fig9.jpg" title="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Animals in the phylum Mollusca include clams, snails, octopuses, and sea slugs (pictured right). They are all protostome coelomates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mollusks&lt;/strong&gt; are characterized by their soft bodies, which are usually protected by a hard calcium carbonate shell. However, this shell can be highly reduced or completely absent in some representatives of the phylum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;Class Gastropoda (meaning &quot;stomach foot&quot;) includes snails, slugs, sea slugs, and nudibranchs. Most snails have a coiled shell, however, the shell is completely absent in nudibranchs (pictured right). &lt;strong&gt;Gastropods&lt;/strong&gt; have terrestrial, marine, and freshwater representatives. Terrestrial gastropods (e.g., snails) lack the gills that are characteristic of other mollusks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial39_Fig10.jpg" title="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Class Bivalvia includes mussels, oysters, and clams (right). &lt;strong&gt;Bivalves&lt;/strong&gt; have a reduced head and two hinged shells connected by strong adductor muscles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial39_Fig11.jpg" title="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Class Cephalopoda includes octopuses, squid (right), cuttlefish, and chambered nautiluses. &lt;strong&gt;Cephalopods&lt;/strong&gt; have a head surrounded by tentacles, which can be used for locomotion and grasping prey. The shells (also called pens) of squid and cuttlefish are reduced and internal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial39_Fig12.jpg" title="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The largest &lt;strong&gt;invertebrates&lt;/strong&gt; (animals without backbones) are the giant squids, which are extremely elusive and typically only encountered washed-up on the shore. The largest, documented giant squid was 18 meters long. The individual in this photo (right) is 9 feet long. More recently, a 33 foot-long squid, weighing 990 pounds, was caught in the waters off New Zealand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial39_Fig13.jpg" title="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These courting cuttlefish (right), from the class Cephalopoda, are a significant food source in many cultures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial39_Fig14.jpg" title="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Class Polyplacophora includes the chitons (right 0. These flat organisms are often observed adhering to rocks in the intertidal zone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mollusk Anatomy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The internal anatomy of a representative mollusk (a snail) reveals how much more complex these organisms are than representatives from any of the preceding Animalia phyla discussed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, the mollusk body plan consists of a muscular &lt;strong&gt;foot&lt;/strong&gt;, a &lt;strong&gt;visceral mass&lt;/strong&gt;, and a &lt;strong&gt;mantle&lt;/strong&gt;. This drawing (right) depicts the basic anatomy of a mollusk. The foot is used for movement (especially in the gastropods) or as an anchor (as observed in chitons). The visceral mass houses most of the internal organs (e.g., the stomach, gonads, and heart). The mantle is the tissue layer that covers the visceral mass. In organisms that have shells, the mantle produces the shell. Underneath the mantle is a mouth at one end and a &lt;strong&gt;mantle cavity&lt;/strong&gt; at the other. The mantle cavity houses the anus and gills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mollusks characteristically have a &lt;strong&gt;radula&lt;/strong&gt; (a rasping structure that is used to scrape food particles from hard surfaces). For example, the radula of mollusks cleans algae off of the surfaces in aquariums.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial39_Fig16.jpg" title="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visit the marine aquarium in the HUB on the University Park campus and look for the radula on the underside of the snails cleaning the walls of the tank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="0" src="http://c.gigcount.com/wildfire/IMP/CXNID=2000002.0NXC/bT*xJmx*PTEzMTEyODUzMDUzMjAmcHQ9MTMxMTI4NTMwNzQ1NSZwPTIwNjQyMSZkPWIyMTU1NTcwJmc9MiZvPTk2NjhhNGRlZDA4/NDRmNzlhYTY1ZTI4N2RlOTA2Y2E4Jm9mPTA=.gif" style="visibility: hidden; width: 0px; height: 0px;" width="0" /&gt;&lt;object data="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2155570" height="480" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="640"&gt;&lt;param name="quality" value="high" /&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2155570" /&gt;&lt;param name="wmode" value="transparent" /&gt;&lt;embed height="480" hspace="10" quality="high" src="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2155570" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" vspace="10" width="640" wmode="transparent"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Protostome Coelomates: The Phylum Annelida&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial39_Fig1.jpg" title="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Animals in the phylum Annelida include the earthworms, leeches, and many marine worms. These protostome coelomates exhibit true &lt;strong&gt;segmentation&lt;/strong&gt;. Segmentation refers to body plans that are divided into discrete units, which may be repeating or may each have a unique function in the body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial39_Fig17.jpg" title="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is easy to detect segmentation in earthworms (right). The segments are physically separated internally by thin sheets of mesoderm-derived tissue termed &lt;strong&gt;septa&lt;/strong&gt; (singular: septum; recall, the term septa was also used to describe structures that delimit cells in the hyphae of fungi, i.e., septate hyphae). Because of these separations, earthworms can contract muscles in some segments without affecting the hydrostatic pressure in adjacent segments. This ability is highly advantageous for movement, and via coordinated contraction and expansion of segments, earthworms are able to burrow into the soil with ease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial39_Fig18.jpg" title="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This figure (right) depicts some of the internal segmentation in an earthworm. The bodies of most &lt;strong&gt;annelids&lt;/strong&gt; consist of a series of repeating segments, with repetition of organ systems (muscular, nervous, reproductive, circulatory, and excretory) in the segments. Therefore, most annelids do not capitalize on one of the main benefits of segmentation, the ability to specialize. Note, many segments have multiple hearts, and each segment has a pair of &lt;strong&gt;nephridia&lt;/strong&gt; (an excretory organ). The next tutorial will discuss how more advanced animals show extreme specialization by exploiting segmentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your recent lab exercise covered many of the main anatomical features of the earthworm. Note how the longitudinal blood vessels, nerve cords, and digestive tract all run the length of the body, whereas the pumping vessels and ganglia are all arranged in segments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tutorial continued our discussion of the bilateria branch of the kingdom Animalia. When you think about this character (bilateral symmetry), keep in mind that it is observed in animals that actively move through their environment. Bilaterally symmetrical animals not only have a single plane of symmetry, but their sensory and cephalic areas are usually displaced toward the anterior end of the animal.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

				&lt;/ul&gt;
			&lt;/td&gt;
		&lt;/tr&gt;
	&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Introduction and Goals&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial40_Fig1.jpg" title="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The previous tutorial concentrated on coelomates collectively known as the protostomes. This tutorial will complete our analysis of the protostome coelomates by examining the most diverse branch of animals, the arthropods. The second half of this tutorial will introduce the last major lineage, the deuterostomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you progress through this tutorial, try to distinguish between the arthropods and other animals classified under the bilateria. How are these groups of animals similar? What morphological and developmental patterns do they have in common? How do they differ? Once you complete this tutorial you should be able to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Explain why the animals in Phylum Arthropoda are thought to be so successful&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Name and discuss the major classes and subgroups of Phylum Arthropoda&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Describe the embryonic characteristics of deuterostomes&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Describe the major characteristics of Phylum Echinodermata&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Arthropod Diversity&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial40_Fig2.jpg" title="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of numbers and the diversity of species, Phylum Arthropoda is the most successful group in Kingdom Animalia. Whether one looks on the land, in the air, or under the sea, they will find representatives from this phylum. Approximately one million &lt;strong&gt;arthropod&lt;/strong&gt; species have been described to date. (Some estimate that the number of uncharacterized species may exceed 10 million.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Characteristics of Arthropods&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial40_Fig3.jpg" title="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The extreme diversity observed in Phylum Arthropoda can be attributed to three main arthropod characteristics that have evolved into various forms to allow for adaptation to different environments: a hard chitinous exoskeleton, body segmentation, and jointed appendages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial40_Fig4.jpg" title="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The arthropod body is covered by a &lt;strong&gt;cuticle&lt;/strong&gt; (structurally different from the cuticle of plants, which was described in tutorial 31, but there are some functional similarities), composed primarily of the polysaccharide chitin (the same type of polymer used by fungi as described in &lt;a href="https://online.science.psu.edu/biol110_sandbox_2381/node/8965"&gt;Fungi I, Evolution and Diversity&lt;/a&gt;), but with a harder character; chitin is also described in the &lt;a href="https://online.science.psu.edu/biol110_sandbox_2381/node/8949" target="_blank" title="Tutorial 16 - Carbon and Life"&gt;carbon and life&lt;/a&gt; tutorial. This exoskeleton endows arthropods with several adaptive features to the terrestrial environment. Its physical durability protects the animals from physical injury. It also provides structural support to the muscles that move their appendages. Lastly, the cuticle is waterproof and helps prevent desiccation in a dry terrestrial environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" height="424" src="assets/Tutorial40_Fig5.jpg" title="" width="274" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only cumbersome feature of the exoskeleton is that it confines growth, but arthropods deal with this problem by periodically shedding their exoskeletons in a process known as &lt;strong&gt;molting&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;Arthropods are segmented, and generally there are distinct boundaries between the segments. For example, animals belonging to Class Insecta have three distinct segments: the head, the &lt;strong&gt;thorax&lt;/strong&gt; (often grouped together with the head as the &lt;strong&gt;cephalothorax&lt;/strong&gt;), and the abdomen. The rhinoceros beetle in the adjacent image has a head and thorax that are fused (a cephalothorax) and a large abdomen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial40_Fig6.jpg" style="width: 450px; height: 328px;" title="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Typically, these different body regions have distinct functions and often contain various types of &lt;strong&gt;jointed appendages&lt;/strong&gt;. Jointed appendages afford the animal with a greater degree of movement. In addition to locomotion, the appendages may be adapted for other functions (e.g., feeding, sensory perception, copulation, and defense).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;Some jointed appendages, such as the swimming appendages of this candy cane shrimp (a crustacean), are specialized to enable different species to adapt to their diverse environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;This figure illustrates the body segmentation (cephalothorax and abdomen) and specialized appendages of a representative arthropod, a lobster (a crustacea). In addition to segmentation, arthropods have an open circulatory system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Phylum Arthropoda: Classification&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial40_Fig7.jpg" title="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The arthropods are traditionally divided into four subgroups or subphyla: trilobites (all are extinct, but the fossil record indicates that they were once the dominant subgroup), chelicerates, crustaceans, and uniramians. As is the case for many taxonomic fields, however, newer molecular approaches are causing scientists to reconsider traditional relationships. As a student, this can create some confusion; hence, for clarity this course will use the traditional taxonomic schemes. However, this taxonomy will likely change as more molecular data provide a clearer insight into arthropod relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial40_Fig8.jpg" style="height: 375px; width: 500px;" title="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The majority of modern &lt;strong&gt;chelicerates&lt;/strong&gt; (e.g., spiders, scorpions, ticks, and mites) are terrestrial arthropods belonging to Class Arachnida. As with the &lt;strong&gt;trilobites&lt;/strong&gt;, most of the marine chelicerates are extinct, even though a few marine members (e.g., the horseshoe crab) have survived. The &lt;strong&gt;arachnids&lt;/strong&gt; (like this tarantula) are best distinguished by their claw-like feeding appendages (&lt;strong&gt;chelicerae&lt;/strong&gt;), from which this subgroup gets its name. Another characteristic of the chelicerates is the presence of two body segments (a cephalothorax and an abdomen). The cephalothorax has six pairs of appendages, including four pairs of walking legs, one pair of chelicerae, and one pair of &lt;strong&gt;pedipalps&lt;/strong&gt;. The pedipalps have either a feeding or sensory function. They lack antennae and have simple eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial40_Fig9.jpg" style="height: 325px; width: 500px;" title="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;crustace&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ans&lt;/strong&gt; make up the second largest arthropod subgroup. Extant species are mainly aquatic animals, although some terrestrial species (e.g., pill bugs and wood lice) are classified within this group. Animals in this class include crabs, lobsters, crayfish and shrimp, and they are the only arthropods with two pairs of antennae. Segmentation is obvious and extensive in these animals. In contrast to the chelicerates, crustaceans have jaw-like &lt;strong&gt;mandibles&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;compound eyes&lt;/strong&gt;. The fiddler crab (shown here) is a typical crustacean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;The &lt;strong&gt;uniramians&lt;/strong&gt;, the largest extant subgroup, represent so many individual species that this subgroup accounts for the majority of all known (and probably most of the still undiscovered) animal species on the planet. The uniramians have mandibles and compound eyes (as do the crustaceans). Uniquely, they have only one pair of sensory antennae and their appendages are unbranched or &lt;strong&gt;uniramous&lt;/strong&gt;, hence their name. Uniramians include Class Insecta, with its twenty-six described orders. Insects first appear in the fossil record about 400 million years ago. Insects have the characteristic uniramian features, and additionally, they have three distinct segments (head, thorax, and abdomen). Two pairs of wings and three pairs of legs are typical. Scientists who study insects are called entomologists. Class Insecta is the largest class in the phylum Arthropoda, and their diversity is unmatched in the kingdom Animalia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="0" src="http://c.gigcount.com/wildfire/IMP/CXNID=2000002.0NXC/bT*xJmx*PTEzMTEyODU1Mzc2NzcmcHQ9MTMxMTI4NTUzOTkyMyZwPTIwNjQyMSZkPWIyMTU2NzkwJmc9MiZvPTk2NjhhNGRlZDA4/NDRmNzlhYTY1ZTI4N2RlOTA2Y2E4Jm9mPTA=.gif" style="visibility: hidden; width: 0px; height: 0px;" width="0" /&gt;&lt;object data="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2156790" height="480" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="640"&gt;&lt;param name="quality" value="high" /&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2156790" /&gt;&lt;param name="wmode" value="transparent" /&gt;&lt;embed height="480" hspace="10" quality="high" src="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2156790" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" vspace="10" width="640" wmode="transparent"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The Other Coelomates: Deuterostomes&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand the evolutionary history of animals, scientists rely on several types of data including, but not limited to, the following: the overall morphology of the organism, DNA sequences and similarities at the molecular level, and the developmental sequence of events in the embryo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial40_Fig10.jpg" title="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sequence of events during embryonic development is the main characteristic used to distinguish protostomes and deuterostomes. Review this figure, which depicts the major developmental characters that distinguish a protostome from a deuterostome. Recall that in protostomes the mouth forms first, whereas in deuterostomes it forms secondarily. Another important distinction is how the coelom forms; in protostomes it forms from a splitting of the mesoderm (schizocoelous), whereas in most deuterostomes the coelom forms from mesodermal outpocketings of the archenteron (enterocoelous).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is some debate about which phyla belong in the deuterostome lineage. In this and the next tutorial we will focus on two phyla that clearly fall into this lineage, Echinodermata and Chordata.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Phylum Echinodermata&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Representatives of the phylum Echinodermata are common inhabitants of coastal tide pools (or even our local saltwater aquarium at the HUB). Sea lilies, sea stars (starfish), and most other &lt;strong&gt;echinoderms&lt;/strong&gt; are sessile or slow-moving animals. Some representatives are instantly recognized by their five-fold symmetry (having rays and/or arms in fives or multiples of five). Even though the radial symmetry of these adult animals would lead one to reject them as belonging to the bilateria, the bilateral symmetry of the larval stage of these animals indicates that they really belong to the bilateria lineage. Furthermore, these animals are also known as coelomates since they have a large, fluid-filled cavity lined with mesoderm and usually a complete gut. Many species of sea stars have the ability to turn their stomachs inside out by everting them through their mouths. This allows them to initiate the digestion of their prey before introducing it to their body cavities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="assets/Tutorial40_Fig11.jpg" title="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A thin skin overlaying a hard, yet flexible, &lt;strong&gt;endoskeleton&lt;/strong&gt; composed of calcium carbonate plates and spines characterizes the exterior of echinoderms. These plates have a very complex arrangement. Electron microscopy of the surface of a sea urchin demonstrates this elegant arrangement, or sponge-like mesh, which creates a plate that allows for special structures to protrude through the endoskeleton for locomotion, feeding, gas exchange, and protection. These protrusions, typically described as &lt;strong&gt;tube feet&lt;/strong&gt; (often suction-cup or sucker-like appendages), enable echinoderms to move and provide them with the ability to grip and manipulate objects or prey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Echinoderms also have a unique &lt;strong&gt;water vascular system&lt;/strong&gt; (a network of hydraulic canals extending in from the tube feet and around the gut of the organism). This expansive network uses hydraulic pressure to manipulate the extension of the tube feet as the animal breathes, feeds, or moves across the ocean floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Phylum Echinodermata: Classification&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Members of the phylum Echinodermata are diverse. In the adult state it is often unclear how these animals are related. However, a close inspection of their anatomy and embryology reveals their common evolutionary history. Shown below are members from four echinoderm classes (you will not be tested on these classes).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;What Do Humans Have In Common With Sea Urchins?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The correlation between humans and sea urchins may not be obvious, however, common embryonic features reveal their common ancestry. As you should have learned, stages of embryonic development have a significant impact on the classification of animal species. Whether it is the fate of the blastopore, the number of germ layers (diploblastic versus triploblastic), or the formation and origin of the tissue lining the body cavity, embryonic origins provide information about the commonalities between all members of the kingdom Animalia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The phylogeny that places humans (and other vertebrates) and echinoderms in close proximity is also supported by nucleic acid sequence data. As more data are collected, these relationships may be reconsidered, but to date the evidence showing embryonic similarities between the species of these groups is compelling. Some scientists have even discussed placing Phylum Echinodermata closer to Phylum Chordata, or even within Phylum Chordata, due to the discovery of some early echinoderms that might have possessed pharyngeal slits and a tail (diagnostic chordate features that are discussed in the next tutorial). Furthermore, undiscovered species may also provide information on the relatedness of chordates and echinoderms. From what you should have learned, would a modern representative of these groups shed more light on this overall question, or could just as much be learned from the fossil of an adult animal? Why or why not?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="0" src="http://c.gigcount.com/wildfire/IMP/CXNID=2000002.0NXC/bT*xJmx*PTEzMTEyODU3MTI4MDMmcHQ9MTMxMTI4NTcxNDg3OSZwPTIwNjQyMSZkPWIyMTU2Nzk4Jmc9MiZvPTk2NjhhNGRlZDA4/NDRmNzlhYTY1ZTI4N2RlOTA2Y2E4Jm9mPTA=.gif" style="visibility: hidden; width: 0px; height: 0px;" width="0" /&gt;&lt;object data="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2156798" height="480" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="640"&gt;&lt;param name="quality" value="high" /&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2156798" /&gt;&lt;param name="wmode" value="transparent" /&gt;&lt;embed height="480" hspace="10" quality="high" src="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2156798" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" vspace="10" width="640" wmode="transparent"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Summary&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tutorial continued our discussion of the bilateria branch of the kingdom Animalia. When you think about the character bilateral symmetry, keep in mind that it is seen in animals that actively move through the environment. Bilaterally symmetrical animals not only have a single plane of symmetry, but their sensory and cephalic areas are usually displaced toward the anterior of the animal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arthropods fall into one of four subgroups. Segmentation, and subsequent specialization, is one of the hallmarks of each of these four subgroups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trilobites were a very successful group that became extinct about 250 million years ago. Although these animals were segmented, they had very little diversification in their segments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chelicerates include spiders. These animals have two major body segments: the cephalothorax and the abdomen. Their appendages are all clustered in the cephalothorax. Typically there are six pairs of appendages. These include the chelicerae, which are involved in feeding, and the pedipalps, which may have a feeding function. The balance of the appendages is legs. This group does not have antennae but does have simple eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crustaceans, the second largest extant subgroup, include mostly aquatic species, however, there are some terrestrial species. They have two pairs of sensory antennae, jaw-like mandibles, and compound eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The uniramians are the largest extant subgroup. Uniramians have jaw-like mandibles, compound eyes, one pair of sensory antennae, and unbranched (uniramous) appendages. This subgroup includes Class Insecta, which have distinct segments of variable numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All arthropods are protostomes. That is, during early development the primitive mouth forms first (before the anus). However, in the deuterostomes the mouth forms secondarily to the anus. The polarity of the embryonic gut is clearly an ancestral trait that links organisms that look very different. The deuterostomes include the echinoderms and the chordates, and in the next (and last) tutorial you will learn more about the chordates.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <title>Tutorial 25: Mitosis/Cell Cycle Regulation</title>
    <body>&lt;h2&gt;Terms:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should have a working knowledge of the following terms:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table border="0" class="confluenceTable"&gt;
	&lt;tbody&gt;
		&lt;tr&gt;
			&lt;td class="confluenceTd"&gt;
				&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;anaphase&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;cell cycle&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;chromatid&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;cytokinesis&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;interphase&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;M phase&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;/ul&gt;
			&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;td class="confluenceTd"&gt;
				&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;metaphase&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;metaphase plate&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;mitosis&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;prophase&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;telophase&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;/ul&gt;
			&lt;/td&gt;
		&lt;/tr&gt;
	&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order for cells to give rise to new cells, all genetic information and cellular contents must be replicated. This tutorial will focus on the cell division in eukaryotic cells known as mitosis.&amp;nbsp; Mitosis is cell division for growth and repair in multicellular organisms.&amp;nbsp; By the end of this tutorial you should have a basic working understanding of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li style="padding-left: 30px;"&gt;The phases of the cell cycle&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li style="padding-left: 30px;"&gt;The major events of each stage of mitosis&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li style="padding-left: 30px;"&gt;Chromosome movement during the cell cycle&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 style="text-align: justify;"&gt;The Cell Cycle&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: justify;"&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="highslide lightbox-processed" assets/Tutorial25_animal_cell.jpg" rel="lightbox[][Cell Components]"&gt;&lt;img alt="Cell Components" class="lightbox" src="assets/Tutorial25_animal_cell.jpg" style="float: right; height: 201px; width: 300px; margin: 10px;" title="Cell Components" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Cell division is a precisely regulated process. Although &lt;strong&gt;mitosis&lt;/strong&gt; is the process by which cell division occurs, many events need to take place prior to the physical separation of a mother cell into two daughter cells. Mitosis is a highly orchestrated process, with many checkpoints that insure events occur in the proper sequence. However, cells only divide at certain times and in specific situations.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;All of the components of a cell must be replicated prior to cell division (only a fraction of the components are shown in this figure of an animal cell). The replication of new components is highly regulated. Only if the cell receives the proper signal (the nature of which is dependent on the particular cell and the environment in which it exists), will&lt;a class="highslide lightbox-processed" assets/Tutorial25_cell_cycle.jpg" rel="lightbox[][Animal Cell Components]"&gt; &lt;img alt="Animal Cell Components" class="lightbox" src="assets/Tutorial25_cell_cycle.jpg" style="float: left; height: 253px; width: 300px; margin: 10px;" title="Animal Cell Components" /&gt; &lt;/a&gt; events be set in motion that lead to cell division. As long as the signal is present, the two new daughter cells will continue to replicate themselves in a cyclical process known as the &lt;strong&gt;cell cycle&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;The cell cycle is a continuous process, but to make it easier to study it can be broken down into four phases. The &lt;strong&gt;M phase&lt;/strong&gt; is the mitotic phase. The other three phases are collectively known as &lt;strong&gt;interphase&lt;/strong&gt;. The three phases of interphase following mitosis are: the the &lt;strong&gt;G1&lt;/strong&gt; growth phase, the &lt;strong&gt;S phase&lt;/strong&gt; or synthesis phase, which is when DNA is replicated, and the &lt;strong&gt;G2&lt;/strong&gt; growth phase. Although the synthesis of nuclear DNA is restricted to the S phase, replication of cellular components can occur throughout the cell cycle (mostly being limited to G1, S, and G2).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Introduction to Mitosis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;The dynamic process of mitosis takes many eukaryotic cells about 1-3 hours to complete. During this time, the cell completes a number of stages. Often the process is simplified and drawn as discrete steps, but it is important to remember that these steps represent landmarks in a continuous process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;To determine which stage of cell division is occurring during mitosis, one observes the behavior of the nucleus. The stages of mitosis are prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase. Each stage will be discussed next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Major Events of Mitosis: Prophase&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="highslide lightbox-processed" assets/Tutorial25_DNA_organization.jpg" rel="lightbox[][DNA Organization]"&gt;&lt;img alt="DNA Organization" class="lightbox" src="assets/Tutorial25_DNA_organization.jpg" style="float: left; height: 200px; width: 350px; margin: 10px;" title="DNA Organization" /&gt; &lt;/a&gt;The first phase of mitosis, &lt;strong&gt;prophase&lt;/strong&gt;, is marked by the condensation of chromosomes.&amp;nbsp; During interphase, DNA is replicated and the replicated chromosomes remain relatively stretched out. It is difficult to visualize individual chromosomes prior to prophase using standard microscopy. This changes once the cell progresses into G2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;The chromosomes begin to condense at some point during G2. In this complex process, each replicated elongated chromosome becomes supercoiled and, as a result, becomes considerably shorter and more tightly packed (depicted in this figure). Each replicated chromosome is only a few microns long, and by the end of prophase appears as two replicated &lt;strong&gt;chromatids&lt;/strong&gt; attached at the &lt;strong&gt;centromere&lt;/strong&gt;. It is important to consider the significance of chromosome condensation; a highly compacted chromosome is easier to move than a stretched-out one. Moreover, chromosomes will physically be moved around in the cell later. If the DNA were stretched out, it would be subject to physical shearing. In the condensed form, it is less prone to physical damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Major Events of Mitosis: Metaphase&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;As the spindle fibers begin attaching to the condensed chromosomes, a complex interaction begins between the mitotic spindle and the chromosomes. The chromosomes begin to jostle back and forth; the microtubules push and pull each of the attached chromosomes. This scenario marks the transition into &lt;strong&gt;metaphase &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a class="highslide lightbox-processed" assets/Tutorial25_metaphase.jpg" rel="lightbox[][Metaphase]"&gt;&lt;img alt="Metaphase" class="lightbox" src="assets/Tutorial25_metaphase.jpg" style="float: right; height: 238px; width: 300px; margin: 10px;" title="Metaphase" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;and represents an intricate cellular event whereby all of the chromosomes appear in a line (the &lt;strong&gt;metaphase plate&lt;/strong&gt;) because the balance of forces drives the collection of all replicated and condensed chromosomes into a single plane in preparation for their segregation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not understood how the cell &quot;knows&quot; when the chromosomes are precisely lined up. However, it is known that this is an important &quot;checkpoint&quot; and that the cell will not proceed to the next step until all of the chromosomes are properly positioned. The jostling of chromosomes can take a good deal of time. Therefore, this stage takes the longest time in most cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Major Events of Mitosis: Anaphase&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spindle fibers typically attach to replicated chromosomes at the centromere. Importantly, each chromatid has a centromere; therefore, in metaphase, the back-and-forth jostling results in chromosomes that are not only lined up in a single plane, but each sister chromatid is aligned opposite one another. This arrangement is well suited for accurate partitioning of the chromatid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the cell senses proper alignment along the metaphase plate, the replicated chromatids separate rapidly, signifying &lt;strong&gt;anaphase&lt;/strong&gt;. Three things happen during anaphase: first, the centromeres that hold the chromatids together dissolve, separating the pairs from each other; second, the newly freed chromatids (now properly called chromosomes) move rapidly toward the spindle poles; and third, the spindle poles move apart. Anaphase is a rapid process (in some cells it is completed within 5 minutes).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Major Events of Mitosis: Telophase and Cytokinesis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The replicated chromosomes (formally called chromatids) are at opposite ends of the spindle poles at the end of anaphase. Both halves of the cell contain equal numbers and kinds of chromosomes. At this point, the nuclear membranes of the daughter cells begin to reform around the new chromosomes located at either end of the cell. At the same time, the chromosomes begin to decondense. The decondensation of chromosomes and nuclear envelope reformation characterizes the &lt;strong&gt;telophase&lt;/strong&gt; stage of mitosis. Note that these two new nuclei contain identical genetic material. For instance, in a human cell there are 46 chromosomes: 23 of paternal origin and 23 of maternal origin. Telophase marks the last part of karyokinesis (the division of genetic material).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;At the same time that nuclear membranes are reforming during telophase, something remarkable is happening to the other cellular components. Remember, the other organelles have already replicated on their own. They are also being separated into the two ends of the cell. The cell then closes off the center of the parent cell, thereby forming two new daughter cells. This process of partitioning the parental cytoplasm (including organelles) is called &lt;strong&gt;cytokinesis&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <body>&lt;h2&gt;Terms&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;anaerobic&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;bioremediation&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;rhizobia&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;saprobe&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Introduction and Goals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;The last two tutorials discussed the diversity of prokaryotes and their various relationships with life in the biosphere. Much of this diversity is reflected in their diverse metabolic activities. More specifically, prokaryotes can use a variety of nitrogen and carbon sources, and in doing so they are important members of the biosphere. Humanity has exploited this evolved diversity by utilizing various bacteria for the cleansing of toxins in the environment, in a process known as &lt;strong&gt;bioremediation&lt;/strong&gt;. By the end of this tutorial you should be familiar with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The diversity of prokaryotic carbon sources&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Bioremediation&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Nitrogen use and the prokaryote&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Oxygen and metabolic relationships&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Origins of metabolic processes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Diversity of Carbon Sources&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prokaryotes can use carbon in a variety of forms, both as an energy source and as a precursor for anabolic reactions. As you&amp;#39;ve learned, carbon dioxide is the simplest form of carbon used. Organisms that use this simple form of carbon are often called &quot;carbon fixers.&quot; (You will learn more about this process in the photosynthesis tutorial.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most prokaryotes use sugars (monosaccharides and disaccharides) and complex carbohydrates (e.g., starch). However, very unusual forms of carbon can also be used by some prokaryotes. Some prokaryotes can feed on oil. Although a bane to the oil fields, these oil-eating bacteria have been used to help clean oil spills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some bacteria are capable of using exotic carbon compounds such as TNT and polychlorinated biphenols (PCBs). These bacteria render such compounds nontoxic. There is an emerging field of civil engineering that utilizes bacteria for the purpose of cleaning contaminated soils, wells, and river sediments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Prokaryotes and the Nitrogen Cycle&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="lightbox lightbox-processed" assets/Tutorial20_nitrogen_cycle.jpg" id="Figure 1. Overview of Nitrogen Fixation." rel="lightbox[][Figure 1. Overview of Nitrogen Fixation.]" title="Figure 1. Overview of Nitrogen Fixation."&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 1. Overview of Nitrogen Fixation." class="lightbox" src="assets/Tutorial20_nitrogen_cycle.jpg" style="float: left; width: 300px; height: 176px; margin: 10px;" title="Figure 1. Overview of Nitrogen Fixation." /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Nitrogen is found in all proteins and nucleic acids, hence it is essential to all forms of life. This atom is abundant in the air around us in the form of atmospheric nitrogen. However, nitrogen availability is a problem because nitrogen, in its elemental form (N2 gas), is not usable by most organisms. Nitrogen can only be transformed into a biologically usable state (i.e., &quot;fixed&quot;) by certain nitrogen-fixing bacteria, in a process termed &lt;strong&gt;nitrogen fixation&lt;/strong&gt;. &quot;Nitrogen-fixers&quot; live in the aquatic environment, the soil, and in or around the roots and stems of certain species of plants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nitrogen gas (also known as dinitrogen or N2) is converted to ammonia (NH3) by nitrogen-fixing bacteria. The fixed nitrogen is then used by plants (and other soil- and aquatic-dwelling microorganisms) in various anabolic pathways leading to the synthesis of proteins, nucleic acids, and other nitrogenous molecules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plants, the primary energy producers in the terrestrial environment, are a major repository for fixed nitrogen in the terrestrial biosphere. When a plant is eaten, the herbivore obtains nitrogen in the form of proteins and nucleic acids (which are broken down during digestion and used by the herbivore for the production of its own nitrogen products). When a plant dies, a variety of &lt;strong&gt;saprobes&lt;/strong&gt; (those organisms that live on dead and decaying matter) also obtain nitrogen from the nitrogenous compounds previously made by the plant. Finally, fixed nitrogen can be reconverted by soil bacteria back into atmospheric nitrogen. The &lt;strong&gt;nitrogen cycle&lt;/strong&gt; is essential for all life on the planet. The previous tutorial briefly introduced the symbiosis that leads to nitrogen fixation. We will now examine this symbiosis in more detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The Nitrogen Fixers&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="lightbox lightbox-processed" assets/Tutorial20_root_nodule.jpg" id="Figure 2. Root Nodules of a Soybean Plant.  The nodules contain nitrogen-fixing bacteria." rel="lightbox[][Figure 2. Root Nodules of a Soybean Plant.  The nodules contain nitrogen-fixing bacteria.]" title="Figure 2. Root Nodules of a Soybean Plant.  The nodules contain nitrogen-fixing bacteria."&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 2. Root Nodules of a Soybean Plant.  The nodules contain nitrogen-fixing bacteria." class="lightbox" height="300" src="assets/Tutorial20_root_nodule.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 10px;" title="Figure 2. Root Nodules of a Soybean Plant.  The nodules contain nitrogen-fixing bacteria." width="300" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost all &lt;strong&gt;legumes&lt;/strong&gt; (e.g., peas, alfalfa, and soybeans) are capable of housing nitrogen-fixing bacteria. The plant-prokaryote mutualism (the plant gets fixed nitrogen from the bacteria, while the bacteria get carbon from the plant) that results is determined by a complex series of events that begins with chemical communication between the participating organisms. Plants that participate in these symbioses secrete molecules (e.g., flavonoids) that act as chemical signals to a select species of bacteria.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;a class="lightbox lightbox-processed" assets/Tutorial20_rhizobium.jpg" id="Figure 3.  A Rhizobium. A bacterium capable of nitrogen-fixation." rel="lightbox[][Figure 3.  A Rhizobium. A bacterium capable of nitrogen-fixation.]"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 3.  A Rhizobium. A bacterium capable of nitrogen-fixation." class="lightbox" src="assets/Tutorial20_rhizobium.jpg" style="float: right; width: 197px; height: 315px; margin: 10px;" title="Figure 3.  A Rhizobium. A bacterium capable of nitrogen-fixation." /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The term &lt;strong&gt;rhizobia&lt;/strong&gt; is applied to several species of bacteria that participate in these symbioses. The targeted rhizobia are induced to respond when the specific chemical signal stimulates specific genes to &quot;turn on.&quot; Bacteria then migrate toward the plant&amp;#39;s root. Once bacteria reach the root, a developmental change is induced in the root, which results in &lt;strong&gt;nodule&lt;/strong&gt; formation. The bacteria take up residence inside the nodule. Thus, the events of nodule formation involve chemical cross-signaling between the two participants. The environment of the plant-derived nodule is favorable for the fixation of nitrogen by the bacteria that live inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="lightbox lightbox-processed" assets/Tutorial20_cyanobacterium.jpg" id="Figure 4. A Cyanobacterium." rel="lightbox[][Figure 4. A Cyanobacterium.]" title="Figure 4. A Cyanobacterium."&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 4. A Cyanobacterium." class="lightbox" src="assets/Tutorial20_cyanobacterium.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 224px; margin: 10px;" title="Figure 4. A Cyanobacterium." /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	In addition to rhizobia/legume symbioses, several other symbiotic nitrogen-fixing symbioses are known. For example, various species of &lt;strong&gt;Cyanobacteria&lt;/strong&gt; (often referred to as blue-green algae) are capable of nitrogen fixation. One symbiosis is particularly important to humanity. Anabaena is a Cyanobacterium genus that colonizes on the leaves of an aquatic fern that grows in rice paddies; the symbiosis supplies nitrogen to the pond, where it subsequently is taken up and used by rice plants. About 75% of all rice is cultivated in flooded fields, and this symbiosis has allowed rice farmers to maintain high levels of productivity without the need for expensive chemical fertilizers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Prokaryotes and Oxygen&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may be hard to envision life without oxygen, but the first prokaryotes (the first creatures on Earth) evolved in an environment with essentially no molecular oxygen (oxygen gas, or O2). Consequently, the first prokaryotes, which originated between 3.5 and 4 billion years ago, were &lt;strong&gt;anaerobic&lt;/strong&gt;. Anaerobic is a general term that refers to any organism, environment, or cellular process that lacks or does not require oxygen, and can even be poisoned by oxygen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original anaerobic organisms thrived in an environment devoid of oxygen. Many scientists think that the early prokaryotes were chemoautotrophs, obtaining energy from inorganic chemicals, possibly using the then-abundant hydrogen sulfide (H2S). Evidence to support this hypothesis can be observed in some hot springs, which contain members of the Archaea. They obtain energy from the combining of ferrous sulfide (FeS) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) in a redox reaction, which releases energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FeS + H2S --&gt; FeS2 + H2&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cyanobacteria, originating between 2.5 and 3.4 billion years ago, were the first photosynthetic bacteria to use water (H2O) as an electron source. They released oxygen as a waste product. These photosynthetic organisms thrived wherever there was sufficient light and a body of water. However, this created a problem on a global scale. After several hundred million years, free oxygen began to accumulate in the atmosphere, which marks the change from a reducing to an oxidizing atmosphere. Initially the high levels of free oxygen were toxic to life. Several mechanisms evolved to take care of this problem; including the use of oxygen in metabolism. Because we need oxygen for our survival, it is hard to believe that oxygen is toxic to many life forms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today prokaryotes (and other life forms) exhibit various metabolic relationships with oxygen. &lt;strong&gt;Obligate aerobes&lt;/strong&gt; require oxygen, whereas &lt;strong&gt;obligate anaerobes&lt;/strong&gt; have no need for oxygen and may even be poisoned by oxygen. &lt;strong&gt;Facultative anaerobes&lt;/strong&gt; can alternate their oxygen requirement. They can use oxygen if it is present, but they can also function in an anaerobic environment. In the upcoming tutorials on energy and cellular respiration, the role of oxygen in cellular processes and how anaerobic organisms get by without oxygen will be addressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tutorial presented the diversity of prokaryotic carbon sources. Bacteria can use simple sugars, as well as complex sources of carbon. Some bacteria can live off oil, and some can decompose cellulose. The ability to breakdown complex carbon sources has been utilized for a variety of purposes. The field of bioremediation is based, to a large extent, on the use of bacteria that can breakdown harmful compounds that have been introduced into the environment from various industrial and agricultural sources. For example, bacteria are capable of breaking down TNT and PCBs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A great deal of life on the planet depends on prokaryotes, either directly or indirectly. The saprophytes degrade material from dead organic matter, and in doing so make nitrogen and carbon available to other life forms. Without them, nutrients would quickly be tied up in the carcasses of dead organisms and unavailable for other organisms in the ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nitrogen is necessary for the synthesis of amino acids. As with carbon, bacteria obtain their nitrogen from various sources. Some bacteria can convert ammonia into a more useful form of nitrogen (like nitrates and nitrites). Saprophytic bacteria obtain their nitrogen from decaying organic matter, whereas nitrogen-fixing bacteria obtain their nitrogen from molecular nitrogen (N2) found in the atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cyanobacteria not only fix their own nitrogen from the air, but they also synthesize their own sugars from carbon dioxide, using sunlight as an energy source. They may be the most efficient form of life on the planet. Indeed, the ancestors of blue-green algae played an important role in the history of the planet because their photosynthetic activity converted our planet&amp;#39;s early anaerobic environment into one that is oxygen rich.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also examined the relationships between oxygen and metabolism, and in the next few tutorials we will explore, in more detail, the relationship between energy and metabolic processes.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

&lt;h2&gt;Introduction and Goals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tutorial will cover the last three protist kingdoms. They have members that are mostly photosynthetic; additionally, many members have a profound influence on humanity. Several links have been added for your interest; however, you will not be tested on material outside of the text within this tutorial. We will begin with a discussion of Kingdom Stramenopila, which includes the diatoms, water molds, and brown algae. Next we will examine Kingdom Rhodophyta (the red algae), and will conclude with Kingdom Chlorophyta (green algae). By the end of this tutorial you should have a fundamental understanding of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The life histories and classifications of Kingdoms Stramenopila, Rhodophyta and Chlorophyta, and Phyla Bacillariophyta, Chrysophyta, Oomycota, and Phaeophyta&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The organisms that caused the &quot;Great Potato Famine&quot; in Ireland, and the outbreak of downy mildew that nearly destroyed the French wine industry&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The basic characteristics of algae, seaweeds, and kelps&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The mode of sexual reproduction known as alternation of generations&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The relationship between plants and photosynthetic protists&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Introduction to Kingdom Stramenopila&lt;/h2&gt;

Although this group is diverse, they all share a common ancestral trait. Namely, the presence of hair-like projections on their flagella; &quot;stramen&quot; means flagellum in Latin, and &quot;pilos&quot; means hair; hence, stramenopilans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Kingdom Stramenopila: Phylum Bacillariophyta (Diatoms)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="lightbox lightbox-processed" assets/Tutorial30_fig2_30.jpg" id="" rel="lightbox[][]" title=""&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="lightbox" src="assets/Tutorial30_fig2_30.jpg" style="float: left; width: 270px; height: 249px; margin: 10px;" title="" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Diatoms are very important from a global perspective. Marine and freshwater plankton are full of photosynthetic diatoms. Some estimates suggest that they may be responsible for over 20% of annual global carbon fixation. &lt;strong&gt;Diatoms&lt;/strong&gt; are encased in a glass-like &lt;strong&gt;silica&lt;/strong&gt; shell, lined with perforations to allow gas exchange at the cell surface. These shells, invisible to the naked eye, are exceptionally beautiful structures. &lt;a class="lightbox lightbox-processed" assets/Tutorial30_fig3_30.jpg" id="" rel="lightbox[][]" title=""&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="lightbox" src="assets/Tutorial30_fig3_30.jpg" style="float: right; width: 270px; height: 216px; margin: 10px;" title="" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Each one consists of two components that fit together, like the bottom and lid of a pillbox. After the death of individual diatoms, their microscopic shells sink and gradually form thick layers of sediment (diatomaceous earth). Living diatoms avoid sinking by regulating their cellular ion concentrations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;Diatomaceous earth, which essentially consists of microscopic fragments of glass, has numerous applications. For example, it is commonly used as a diatomaceous earth pesticide; the sharp edges of diatom shells scrape arthropod exoskeletons and gut linings, causing water loss and eventually death by desiccation. It also damages the tissues of worms and other small creatures, and often is incorporated into animal feed to reduce the occurrence of intestinal parasites. It has myriad other uses (e.g., giving scouring power to cleaning products, and allowing ultrafine filtration for scientific applications and water-purification systems).&lt;a class="lightbox lightbox-processed" assets/Tutorial30_fig4_30.jpg" id="" rel="lightbox[][]" title=""&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="lightbox" src="assets/Tutorial30_fig4_30.jpg" style="float: right; width: 300px; height: 254px; margin: 10px;" title="" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;Silica shells are fairly inert, and diatomaceous earth tends to stay where it settles. Therefore, scientists can look at the assemblages of diatom species in soil cores taken from diatomaceous earth, where the deepest layers of the sample are the oldest and represent the most distant past. They can date the samples and examine changes in the number of warm-climate diatom species and cool-climate species over time, gaining clues about ancient climatic patterns. Actually, it is not quite this simple. Other factors, besides temperature, can influence the diatom species found. Also, scientists do not know the temperature preferences of extinct diatom species discovered in samples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diatoms are mostly photosynthetic, but there are also heterotrophic species. Cell division in diatoms was discusssed in &lt;a href="https://online.science.psu.edu/biol110_sandbox_2381/node/8912" title="Tutorial 25 - Mitosis-Cell Cycle Regulation"&gt;Tutorial 25: Mitosis-Cell Cycle Regulation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Kingdom Stramenopila: Phylum Chrysophyta (Golden Algae)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="lightbox lightbox-processed" assets/Tutorial30_fig5_30.jpg" id="" rel="lightbox[][]" title=""&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="lightbox" src="assets/Tutorial30_fig5_30.jpg" style="float: left; width: 300px; height: 253px; margin: 10px;" title="" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class="lightbox lightbox-processed" assets/Tutorial30_fig6_30.jpg" id="" rel="lightbox[][]" title=""&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="lightbox" src="assets/Tutorial20_nitrogen_cycle.jpg" style="float: right; width: 300px; height: 176px; margin: 10px;" title="" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Chrysophytes are planktonic organisms that possess a rich golden color due to the presence of carotenoids and xanthophylls. These &lt;strong&gt;accessory pigments&lt;/strong&gt; allow them to expand the range of light wavelengths they can use during photosynthesis. Many golden algae are predators (as well as being photoautotrophic), using &lt;strong&gt;pseudopodia&lt;/strong&gt; to prey on smaller organisms (e.g., diatoms and bacteria). Some possess silica scales, similar in composition to the shells of diatoms; silica also coats the quiescent cysts that form under unfavorable conditions, allowing chrysophytes to remain dormant for decades. Most chrysophytes are unicellular, but some species are colonial and quite elaborate in structure (e.g., &lt;em&gt;Synura&lt;/em&gt; sp. colony pictured below).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Kingdom Stramenopila: Phylum Oomycota&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="lightbox lightbox-processed" assets/Tutorial30_fig7_30.jpg" id="" rel="lightbox[][]" title=""&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="lightbox" src="assets/Tutorial30_fig7_30.jpg" style="float: right; width: 300px; height: 186px; margin: 10px;" title="" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Oomycetes include the water molds and downy mildews. Some are unicellular, and many others are colonial. Most are heterotrophic decomposers that feed on dead and decaying organic matter in aquatic and terrestrial environments, but a number attack living plants and animals. The name &quot;oomycete&quot; means &quot;egg fungi,&quot; which is a reference to the reproductive structures of sexually reproducing oomycetes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="lightbox lightbox-processed" assets/Tutorial30_fig8_30.jpg" id="" rel="lightbox[][]" title=""&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="lightbox" src="assets/Tutorial30_fig8_30.jpg" style="float: left; width: 300px; height: 162px; margin: 10px;" title="" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Although oomycetes are not closely related to fungi, the two groups have some similarities. In particular, both groups are heterotrophs that break down food externally and then absorb nutrients from their surroundings. Additionally, many of the multicellular oomycetes form &lt;strong&gt;hyphae&lt;/strong&gt;, which are very similar to fungal hyphae although the structures are not identical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there are more differences than similarities. For example, the cell walls of oomycetes are composed of cellulose, not chitin (the compound found in the cell walls of fungi). Unlike true fungi, which are haploid in the feeding stage, the hyphae of most oomycetes are composed of diploid cells. Furthermore, the presence of the storage compound mycolaminarin, along with molecular evidence and the presence of flagellated cells similar to those of other stramenopiles, indicate that oomycetes belong within Kingdom Stramenopila.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The resemblance between fungi and oomycetes is an example of &lt;strong&gt;convergent evolution&lt;/strong&gt;, the process by which unrelated organisms that occupy similar environments evolve similar functional traits. For example, oomycetes and fungi are decomposers and therefore stand to gain an advantage from maximizing their surface area for the absorption of food; thus, the filamentous growth form might have been favored by independent evolution in both lineages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Oomycetes Impact on Humans&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="lightbox lightbox-processed" assets/Tutorial30_fig10_30.jpg" id="" rel="lightbox[][]" title=""&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="lightbox" src="assets/Tutorial30_fig10_30.jpg" style="float: left; width: 270px; height: 388px; margin: 10px;" title="" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class="lightbox lightbox-processed" assets/Tutorial30_fig11_30.jpg" id="" rel="lightbox[][]" title=""&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="lightbox" src="assets/Tutorial30_fig11_30.jpg" style="float: right; width: 300px; height: 226px; margin: 10px;" title="" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Oomycetes have been responsible for a number of catastrophic historical events, including the outbreak of downy mildew that nearly wiped out the French wine industry in the late nineteenth century. &lt;em&gt;Plasmopara&lt;/em&gt;, a native of the New World, was inadvertently brought to France from the United States in 1870 in a shipment of American grape root stock. It quickly became a devastating problem. A mixture of lime and copper sulfate, the first chemicals used to combat a plant pathogen, solved the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; The oomycete Phytophthora infestans, or potato blight, was responsible for another cataclysmic event, the Great Potato Famine, which killed nearly one-million people in Ireland in the late 1800s, and drove one-and-a-half-million more out of the country. &lt;a class="lightbox lightbox-processed" assets/Tutorial30_fig12_30.jpg" id="" rel="lightbox[][]" title=""&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="lightbox" src="assets/Tutorial30_fig12_30.jpg" style="float: right; width: 300px; height: 203px; margin: 10px;" title="" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;Phytophthora&lt;/em&gt; secretes enzymes that break down leaf and stem tissue, killing plants very rapidly. Tubers can become infested, turning soft and black, seemingly overnight. Potato fields in Ireland became infested with &lt;em&gt;Phytophthora&lt;/em&gt;, which thrived in the cool damp climate of Ireland and wiped out nearly the entire country&amp;#39;s crop in one week. In nineteenth-century Ireland, potatoes were the primary food source of the poorest classes, who often grew nothing other than potatoes. The loss of this staple crop led to mass starvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Kingdom Stramenopila: Phylum Phaeophyta (Brown Algae)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="lightbox lightbox-processed" assets/Tutorial30_fig13_30.jpg" id="" rel="lightbox[][]" title=""&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="lightbox" src="assets/Tutorial20_nitrogen_cycle.jpg" style="float: right; width: 300px; height: 176px; margin: 10px;" title="" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Phaeophytes, or brown algae, include the largest of the protists, with some growing over 100 feet in length. The giant multicellular species that comprise &quot;kelp forests&quot; in temperate marine waters belong to this group. The edible alga &quot;kombu,&quot; which is harvested by the Japanese, is also a phaeophyte. It is particularly rich in minerals, as are other marine algae. Like the chrysophytes, phaeophytes contain specific accessory pigments that give them their characteristic colors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="lightbox lightbox-processed" assets/Tutorial30_fig14_30.jpg" id="" rel="lightbox[][]" title=""&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="lightbox" src="assets/Tutorial30_fig14_30.jpg" style="float: left; width: 300px; height: 205px; margin: 10px;" title="" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Along with the two kingdoms that we will discuss next, Rhodophyta and Chlorophyta, Phylum Phaeophyta includes a number of &lt;strong&gt;seaweeds&lt;/strong&gt;. Although it is not a taxonomic term, the word &quot;seaweed&quot; is a useful way of distinguishing large intertidal algae from other species (e.g., planktonic algae). Many types of seaweed, including those within the Phylum Phaeophyta, have complex structures that are reminiscent of plants. The &lt;strong&gt;thallus&lt;/strong&gt; refers to the entire body of any seaweed that is plant-like in appearance. The thallus consists of three main parts: a &lt;strong&gt;stipe&lt;/strong&gt;, which is analogous to the stem of plants; a &lt;strong&gt;holdfast&lt;/strong&gt;, which secures the seaweed to a substrate; and leaf-like &lt;strong&gt;blades&lt;/strong&gt;, which provide extensive surface area for photosynthesis, much as leaves do for plants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="lightbox lightbox-processed" assets/Tutorial30_fig15_30.jpg" id="" rel="lightbox[][]" title=""&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="lightbox" src="assets/Tutorial30_fig15_30.jpg" style="float: right; width: 300px; height: 200px; margin: 10px;" title="" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Another word used informally to describe a specific type of alga is &quot;&lt;strong&gt;kelp&lt;/strong&gt;,&quot; which refers to giant seaweeds that grow in the deeper waters outside of the intertidal zone. All kelps, which form vast &quot;forests&quot; that support thriving marine ecosystems, are phaeophytes. As one can see (left), these organisms can reach very impressive sizes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Alternation of Generations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recall from the tutorial on &lt;a href="https://online.science.psu.edu/biol110_sandbox_2381/node/8934" title="Tutorial 2 - Heredity and Life Cycles"&gt;Heredity and Life Cycles&lt;/a&gt; that life cycles were discussed. In this discussion, alternation of generations was introduced. Although there is great variety in modes of reproduction among algae, we will focus on alternation of generations (the most complex of their life cycles). It occurs in Phylum Phaeophyta and in the two kingdoms that we will discuss next, the Rhodophyta and the Chlorophyta. This type of life cycle is also seen in more complex organisms. For example, plants also alternate generations during sexual reproduction, as do fungi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alternation of generations&lt;/strong&gt; refers specifically to the alternation between multicellular haploid life stages and multicellular diploid life stages. The key feature is that both the diploid and haploid stages are multicellular. Diploid forms (sporophytes) produce haploid spores, which divide and develop directly into multicellular haploid structures (gametophytes). Gametophytes then produce haploid gametes, which join with other gametes to form diploid sporophytes once again. In other words, the diploid and haploid generations alternate, over and over. In some organisms the diploid stage is the dominant form that is responsible for the majority of growth and resource acquisition, whereas in others (e.g., fungi) the haploid stage is dominant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brown alga &lt;em&gt;Laminaria&lt;/em&gt; is a model for alternation of generations. Laminaria reproduces with &lt;strong&gt;heteromorphic&lt;/strong&gt; alternation of generations (shown below under Chlorophyta). That is, the haploid and diploid stages exhibit different forms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Kingdom Rhodophyta&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Members of Kingdom Rhodophyta differ from other eukaryotic algae because they do not have flagellated cells at any point in their life cycles. DNA sequence data (and other sources) indicate that this lineage arose independently, sometime before Kingdom Stramenopila.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="lightbox lightbox-processed" assets/Tutorial30_fig16_30.jpg" id="" rel="lightbox[][]" title=""&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="lightbox" src="assets/Tutorial30_fig16_30.jpg" style="float: right; width: 300px; height: 198px; margin: 10px;" title="" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Most &lt;strong&gt;rhodophytes&lt;/strong&gt; are marine algae, but a number of species live in freshwater and some even inhabit terrestrial niches. Alternation of generations occurs frequently in Kingdom Rhodophyta. Like many of the photosynthetic eukaryotes, rhodophytes are characterized by accessory pigments in their chloroplasts, which endow them with unique colors. In the case of rhodophytes, also called red algae, pigments called &lt;strong&gt;phycobilins&lt;/strong&gt; produce rich shades of pink, scarlet, and red that are so deep that they approach black. These red pigments, in particular the phycobilin phycoerythrin, allow rhodophytes to photosynthesize at depths where only high-energy blue and green light can penetrate. In fact, the color of rhodophyte species tends to be correlated with the depth where they commonly occur; deep-water species are often nearly black, concentrated with phycoerythrin, whereas shallow-water species can contain so few accessory pigments that they appear almost green, having few pigments to mask the green color of chlorophyll.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many red algae are large multicellular organisms, although they are not in the same size class as the largest of the brown algae. A number of these species are of economic importance; the odds are very good that you&amp;#39;ve eaten red algae or that you have relied on its derivatives. The seaweed used in sushi (nori) is a red alga.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Kingdom Chlorophyta&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="lightbox lightbox-processed" assets/Tutorial30_fig17_30.jpg" id="" rel="lightbox[][]" title=""&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="lightbox" src="assets/Tutorial30_fig17_30.jpg" style="float: left; width: 300px; height: 230px; margin: 10px;" title="" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class="lightbox lightbox-processed" assets/Tutorial30_fig18_30.jpg" id="" rel="lightbox[][]" title=""&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="lightbox" src="assets/Tutorial30_fig18_30.jpg" style="float: right; width: 300px; height: 225px; margin: 10px;" title="" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Chlorophytes, or green algae, resemble plants more closely than do any of the other photosynthetic protists. In fact, some classification systems group members of Kingdom Chlorophyta with plants on the premise that green algae actually resemble plants more closely than they resemble other protists. The chlorophyll of green algae (chlorophyll &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt; and chlorophyll &lt;em&gt;b&lt;/em&gt;) is strikingly similar to that of plants. Green algae also resemble plants because they store fixed carbon as starch and they possess cell walls composed of cellulose. Although the issue is contentious, most systematists continue to classify green algae separately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="lightbox lightbox-processed" assets/Tutorial30_fig19_30.jpg" id="" rel="lightbox[][]" title=""&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="lightbox" src="assets/Tutorial30_fig19_30.jpg" style="float: left; width: 250px; height: 286px; margin: 10px;" title="" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class="lightbox lightbox-processed" assets/Tutorial30_fig20_30.jpg" id="" rel="lightbox[][]" title=""&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="lightbox" src="assets/Tutorial30_fig20_30.jpg" style="float: right; width: 291px; height: 200px; margin: 10px;" title="" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; There is a tremendous amount of diversity within this kingdom. Chlorophytes occupy a remarkable array of habitats, including marine, freshwater and terrestrial environments. A number are seaweeds, most are freshwater algae, and some terrestrial chlorophytes (&lt;strong&gt;lichens&lt;/strong&gt;) live in a symbiotic association with fungi. The 7,000 species that comprise this kingdom range from unicellular to colonial to truly multicellular. Separate evolutionary events might have led to the evolution from single-celled green algae to colonial organisms (e.g., the beautiful &lt;em&gt;Volvox&lt;/em&gt;), to multinucleate single-celled seaweeds, and to multicellular seaweeds (e.g., &lt;em&gt;Ulva&lt;/em&gt;). The photos below show the diversity of this group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="lightbox lightbox-processed" assets/Tutorial30_fig21_30.jpg" id="" rel="lightbox[][]" title=""&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="lightbox" src="assets/Tutorial30_fig21_30.jpg" style="float: left; width: 277px; height: 200px; margin: 10px;" title="" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Kingdom Chlorophyta also exhibits many forms of reproduction, and most species reproduce asexually and sexually. For example, &lt;em&gt;Spirogyra&lt;/em&gt; is composed of long filaments of cells that can break apart and divide to produce new individuals. &lt;a class="lightbox lightbox-processed" assets/Tutorial30_fig22_30.jpg" id="" rel="lightbox[][]" title=""&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="lightbox" src="assets/Tutorial30_fig22_30.jpg" style="float: right; width: 250px; height: 200px; margin: 10px;" title="" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Alternatively, bridges can form between different individuals, allowing the exchange of gametes. Like the brown and red algae, many green algae also display alternation of generations during their sexual cycles, switching between haploid and diploid forms. Note, unlike the brown alga &lt;em&gt;Laminaria&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Ulva&lt;/em&gt; alternates between haploid and diploid forms that are structurally similar. This is referred to as &lt;strong&gt;isomorphic&lt;/strong&gt; alternation of generations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The protists are ecologically and economically significant organisms; they are responsible for a large portion of the Earth&amp;#39;s fixed carbon and for a number of plant and animal diseases, some of which have caused considerable devastation to mankind. Considering their small size, their diversity is astounding. The beginnings of multicellularity in early protists paved the way for even greater structural complexity and diversity in taxa such as plants, animals, and fungi. For more information on the systematics and taxonomy of protists (and all other life forms), the web site of the University of California-Berkeley&amp;#39;s Museum of Paleontology is an excellent resource, although their system of classification differs somewhat from the system used in this course.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

&lt;h2&gt;Introduction and Goals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last tutorial concluded with a discussion of nucleic acid structure. Watson and Crick concluded their 1953 paper on the structure of DNA with the following statement:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;It has not escaped our notice that the specific pairing we have postulated immediately suggests a possible copying mechanism for the genetic material.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="lightbox lightbox-processed" assets/Tutorial17_cartoon.jpg" id="" rel="lightbox[][]" title=""&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="lightbox" src="assets/Tutorial17_cartoon.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 325px; margin: 10px;" title="" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="lightbox lightbox-processed" assets/Tutorial17_DNA_structure1.jpg" id="Figure 1.  The structure of DNA.  Notice the base pairing rules - A always pairs with T and G always pairs with C." rel="lightbox[][Figure 1.  The structure of DNA.

Notice the base pairing rules - A always pairs with T and G always pairs with C."&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 1.  The structure of DNA.  Notice the base pairing rules - A always pairs with T and G always pairs with C." class="lightbox" src="assets/Tutorial17_DNA_structure1.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 333px; margin: 10px;" title="Figure 1.  The structure of DNA.  Notice the base pairing rules - A always pairs with T and G always pairs with C." /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The &quot;specific pairing&quot; they mentioned is the hydrogen-bond association between adenine and thymine, and guanine and cytosine. The &quot;copying mechanism&quot; is DNA replication, an amazingly simple yet surprisingly accurate series of steps by which DNA carries the instructions for its own reproduction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tutorial will cover DNA replication first, then the synthesis of RNA, and conclude with protein synthesis. By the end of the tutorial you should have a basic understanding of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;DNA replication&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;RNA transcription&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Protein translation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;DNA Replication&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="lightbox lightbox-processed" assets/Tutorial17_semiconservative_replication.jpg" id="Figure 2.  Semiconservative DNA Replication.  Each new molecule of DNA is comprised of one parental strand and one newly synthesized strand." rel="lightbox[][Figure 2.  Semiconservative DNA Replication.  Each new molecule of DNA is comprised of one parental strand and one newly synthesized strand.]" title="Figure 2.  Semiconservative DNA Replication.  Each new molecule of DNA is comprised of one parental strand and one newly synthesized strand."&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 2.  Semiconservative DNA Replication.  Each new molecule of DNA is comprised of one parental strand and one newly synthesized strand." class="lightbox" src="assets/Tutorial17_semiconservative_replication.jpg" style="float: right; width: 300px; height: 182px; margin: 10px;" title="Figure 2.  Semiconservative DNA Replication.  Each new molecule of DNA is comprised of one parental strand and one newly synthesized strand." /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DNA replication can be divided into several basic components. The double helix unwinds and nitrogenous bases are added to each strand of the existing molecule (but only onto one end of each), resulting in two perfect copies from one original.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="lightbox lightbox-processed" assets/Tutorial17_DNA_structure.jpg" id="Figure 3.  DNA structure." rel="lightbox[][Figure 3.  DNA structure.]" title="Figure 3.  DNA structure."&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 3.  DNA structure." class="lightbox" src="assets/Tutorial17_DNA_structure.jpg" style="float: left; width: 343px; height: 450px; margin: 10px;" title="Figure 3.  DNA structure." /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This type of replication is termed semiconservative replication because each newly formed molecule of DNA has one strand conserved from the parent molecule and one newly synthesized strand (depicted left).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The animation on the left gives an overview of DNA replication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a given piece of DNA, replication begins at numerous &lt;strong&gt;origins of replication&lt;/strong&gt;. Each origin of replication is composed of a team of enzyme proteins that are involved in DNA replication. &lt;strong&gt;Helicases&lt;/strong&gt; unwind the DNA helix, &lt;strong&gt;single-strand binding proteins&lt;/strong&gt; keep the strands separate while &lt;strong&gt;primases&lt;/strong&gt; initiate replication, and &lt;strong&gt;DNA polymerase&lt;/strong&gt; adds nucleotides to the unwound parent molecule. While the fundamentals of replication are simple, there is a feature of DNA structure that makes things a bit more complicated; the strands have opposite chemical polarities. This can be hard to comprehend because the strands seem identical. However, a close inspection reveals that the H-bonding that occurs between bases is only achieved if the strands have opposite polarities. This arrangement of strands is &lt;strong&gt;antiparallel&lt;/strong&gt;, with one strand designated the 3&amp;#39;-to-5&amp;#39; strand and the other the 5&amp;#39;-to-3&amp;#39; strand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="lightbox lightbox-processed" assets/Tutorial17_DNA_replication_overview.jpg" id="Figure 4.  An overview of DNA replication." rel="lightbox[][Figure 4.  An overview of DNA replication.]" title="Figure 4.  An overview of DNA replication."&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 4.  An overview of DNA replication." class="lightbox" src="assets/Tutorial17_DNA_replication_overview.jpg" style="float: right; width: 300px; height: 203px; margin: 10px;" title="Figure 4.  An overview of DNA replication." /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DNA polymerase can only add nucleotides to the 3&amp;#39; end of a parent strand. Therefore, nucleotide addition is a smooth, continuous process along one of the strands (the &lt;strong&gt;leading strand&lt;/strong&gt;) of DNA. The other strand (the &lt;strong&gt;lagging strand&lt;/strong&gt;) has a discontinuous mode of replication because DNA polymerase can only work by starting from the &lt;strong&gt;replication fork&lt;/strong&gt;(where DNA is unwinding) and progressing outward (until it runs into a previously synthesized fragment). An added wrinkle to the process on the lagging strand is created by the lack of a continuous new strand; DNA polymerase can only add nucleotides to an existing 3&amp;#39; nucleotide. How is this lagging strand started? Primase has the ability to synthesize a short &lt;strong&gt;primer&lt;/strong&gt; made of a few nucleotides of RNA. DNA polymerase can then add DNA nucleotides to the end of this primer sequence and synthesize relatively short stretches of DNA known as &lt;strong&gt;Okazaki fragments&lt;/strong&gt;. An additional enzyme (&lt;strong&gt;ligase&lt;/strong&gt;) seals the fragments into a continuous strand of DNA. The figure above provides an overview of the enzymes involved, antiparallelism, and the overall direction of DNA replication. All of this takes place in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells (cells that have membrane-bound nuclei and organelles). Be sure that you study this figure carefully. You could see this figure unlabeled and be asked to name the enzymes and their functions on an exam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In spite of the rules of base-pairing, sometimes mistakes are made in the synthesis of new DNA molecules. This occurs about once in every 10,000 base pairs. This fraction may seem small, but left unchecked could be disastrous. However, various repair mechanisms fix these errors and, in the end, the actual observed error rate is very low (often less than one mistake/10 million bases). Numerous specialized proteins are known to repair base-pairing errors and damage to existing molecules of DNA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Gene To Protein: The Central Dogma&lt;img border="0" height="0" src="http://c.gigcount.com/wildfire/IMP/CXNID=2000002.0NXC/bT*xJmx*PTEzMDg2Njk3NjEzNDAmcHQ9MTMwODY2OTc2NDg4NSZwPTIwNjQyMSZkPWIyMTIyMzAwJmc9MiZvPTk2NjhhNGRlZDA4/NDRmNzlhYTY1ZTI4N2RlOTA2Y2E4Jm9mPTA=.gif" style="visibility: hidden; width: 0px; height: 0px;" width="0" /&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The central dogma (prevailing theme) of molecular biology is: DNA is transcribed into messenger RNA, and messenger RNA is translated into proteins. In other words, DNA codes for the synthesis of polypeptides, which in a specific conformation and perhaps in conjunction with other polypeptides make up proteins. This is accomplished via two processes: &lt;strong&gt;transcription&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;translation&lt;/strong&gt;. First, one of the DNA strands is used as a template to make messenger RNA (mRNA; discussed herein). This single strand of bases is then complementary to one side of the DNA molecule and is identical (except for the substitution of uracil for thymine) to the other strand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="lightbox lightbox-processed" assets/Tutorial17_transcription_translation.jpg" id="Figure 5. Transcription and Translation in Prokaryotic Cells versus Eukaryotic Cells." rel="lightbox[][Figure 5. Transcription and Translation in Prokaryotic Cells versus Eukaryotic Cells.]" title="Figure 5. Transcription and Translation in Prokaryotic Cells versus Eukaryotic Cells."&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 5. Transcription and Translation in Prokaryotic Cells versus Eukaryotic Cells." class="lightbox" src="assets/Tutorial17_transcription_translation.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 316px; margin: 10px;" title="Figure 5. Transcription and Translation in Prokaryotic Cells versus Eukaryotic Cells." /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transcription occurs in the nucleus of eukaryotes, but then the mRNA leaves the nucleus to begin translating proteins. The image above outlines these steps, along with where they occur in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. Note that because prokaryotes do not have a nucleus and mRNA has nowhere to travel, proteins can be translated from mRNA immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Gene To Protein: The Triplet Code&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;It should be clear that it is the actual sequence of nucleotides (adenines, guanines, cytosines, and thymines) in a DNA strand that determines the type of protein that is synthesized (depicted here). However, there are four possible bases and twenty possible amino acids that join to form a polypeptide chain, so one base cannot code for one amino acid; that scenario would yield only four possibilities. A two-base code would provide only sixteen possibilities, so apparently a minimum of three bases is needed to specify a particular amino acid. In 1961, Marshall Nirenberg &quot;cracked&quot; the &lt;strong&gt;genetic code&lt;/strong&gt; by determining the &lt;strong&gt;codon&lt;/strong&gt;(sequence of bases) that specifies the amino acid phenylalanine. The amino acids lysine, glycine and proline followed, and now the sequence of bases that codes for each of the amino acids found in proteins is known. The image below illustrates the &quot;dictionary&quot; of the genetic code for amino acids by RNA bases (complementary to the original DNA template strand). The way in which a sequence of DNA bases is transcribed into complementary RNA bases and then translated into corresponding amino acids is illustrated in the image below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="lightbox lightbox-processed" assets/Tutorial17_triplet_code.jpg" id="Figure 6.  The genetic code is a triplet code." rel="lightbox[][Figure 6.  The genetic code is a triplet code.]" title="Figure 6.  The genetic code is a triplet code."&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 6.  The genetic code is a triplet code." class="lightbox" src="assets/Tutorial17_triplet_code.jpg" style="width: 400px; height: 171px; margin: 10px;" title="Figure 6.  The genetic code is a triplet code." /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="lightbox lightbox-processed" assets/Tutorial17_genetic_code.jpg" id="Figure 7.  The Genetic Code." rel="lightbox[][Figure 7.  The Genetic Code.]" title="Figure 7.  The Genetic Code."&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 7.  The Genetic Code." class="lightbox" src="assets/Tutorial17_genetic_code.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 306px; margin: 10px;" title="Figure 7.  The Genetic Code." /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two adjectives that are often used to describe the genetic code are &quot;unambiguous&quot; and &quot;redundant.&quot; Unambiguous means that the codons are fixed and that each codon specifies one amino acid. For example, ACC codes for tryptophan and nothing else. However, codons may be redundant, meaning that several codons may say the same thing. For example, CAA, CAC, CAG, and CAT all code for a single amino acid (valine). This image illustrates how codons are unambiguous and redundant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Gene To Protein: Transcription&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How are proteins made? First, one of the two strands of DNA is transcribed into a single strand of complementary RNA termed &lt;strong&gt;messenger RNA&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;strong&gt;mRNA&lt;/strong&gt;). As you should now understand, this RNA is complementary to only one of the DNA strands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned, the process of transcription occurs in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells and requires that the two strands of DNA separate, or open up sufficiently enough so that complementary RNA nucleotides can be added to one side of the DNA molecule. The strand that is copied is the &lt;strong&gt;template strand&lt;/strong&gt;. The enzyme &lt;strong&gt;RNA polymerase&lt;/strong&gt;separates the DNA strands and joins the RNA nucleotides along the exposed DNA template. This process is initiated when certain proteins, &lt;strong&gt;transcription factors&lt;/strong&gt;, bind to a specific starting point, the &lt;strong&gt;promoter&lt;/strong&gt;. The promoter is actually a sequence of DNA bases that signals the beginning of RNA synthesis. RNA polymerase then adds nucleotides to the 3&amp;#39; end of the elongating RNA molecule. The enzyme then moves down the DNA strand, unwinding as it goes and allowing the DNA helix to reform after a sequence has been transcribed. This continues until a specific RNA sequence is transcribed. This sequence, the &lt;strong&gt;terminator sequence&lt;/strong&gt;, signals the end of RNA synthesis. Transcription is broken down into three stages: initiation, elongation, and termination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This animation shows the process of transcription.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Gene To Protein: Translation Ingredients&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="lightbox lightbox-processed" assets/Tutorial17_translation.jpg" id="Figure 8. Overview of Involvement of Ribosomes, tRNA and mRNA in Translation." rel="lightbox[][Figure 8. Overview of Involvement of Ribosomes, tRNA and mRNA in Translation.]" title="Figure 8. Overview of Involvement of Ribosomes, tRNA and mRNA in Translation."&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 8. Overview of Involvement of Ribosomes, tRNA and mRNA in Translation." class="lightbox" src="assets/Tutorial17_translation.jpg" style="width: 350px; height: 222px; margin: 10px;" title="Figure 8. Overview of Involvement of Ribosomes, tRNA and mRNA in Translation." /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to mRNA, two other types of RNA are needed for protein synthesis. These are &lt;strong&gt;ribosomal RNA&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;strong&gt;rRNA&lt;/strong&gt;) and &lt;strong&gt;transfer RNA&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;strong&gt;tRNA&lt;/strong&gt;). Ribosomal RNA combines with proteins to form &lt;strong&gt;ribosomes&lt;/strong&gt;. Ribosomes are cellular structures where polypeptides form. Ribosomes actually consist of two subunits: one large and one small. &lt;a class="lightbox lightbox-processed" assets/Tutorial17_tRNA.jpg" id="Figure 9. The Structure of Transfer RNA (tRNA)." rel="lightbox[][Figure 9. The Structure of Transfer RNA (tRNA).]" title="Figure 9. The Structure of Transfer RNA (tRNA)."&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 9. The Structure of Transfer RNA (tRNA)." class="lightbox" src="assets/Tutorial17_tRNA.jpg" style="width: 350px; height: 225px; margin: 10px;" title="Figure 9. The Structure of Transfer RNA (tRNA)." /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;As illustrated in this figure, tRNA molecules transport amino acids to the growing polypeptide chain. Each tRNA molecule has an amino acid attachment site for a particular amino acid and an &lt;strong&gt;anticodon&lt;/strong&gt; (a sequence of three nucleotides that is complementary to a sequence of bases in the mRNA strand).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="lightbox lightbox-processed" assets/Tutorial17_aminoacyl_tRNA.jpg" id="Figure 10. Aminoacyl-tRNA Synthetase's Role in Translation." rel="lightbox[][Figure 10. Aminoacyl-tRNA Synthetase's Role in Translation.]" title="Figure 10. Aminoacyl-tRNA Synthetase's Role in Translation."&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 10. Aminoacyl-tRNA Synthetase's Role in Translation." class="lightbox" src="assets/Tutorial17_aminoacyl_tRNA.jpg" style="width: 350px; height: 160px; margin: 10px;" title="Figure 10. Aminoacyl-tRNA Synthetase's Role in Translation." /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An additional component, the enzyme aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase, insures that a given tRNA molecule picks up only its particular amino acid. Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase has specific sites that bind amino acids and tRNA, and energy is required to bring these raw materials together. (This explains the yellow ATP in this figure; to be discussed in future tutorials.) Also, be aware that each codon has its own tRNA, with its own anticodon. To insure high fidelity of protein translation, each tRNA has a corresponding aminoacyl-tRNA. Once you&amp;#39;re comfortable with all the necessary components (mRNA, ribosomes, tRNA, amino acids), proceed to protein synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="lightbox lightbox-processed" assets/Tutorial17_translation1.jpg" id="Figure 11. Overview of Involvement of Ribosomes, tRNA and mRNA in Translation." rel="lightbox[][Figure 11. Overview of Involvement of Ribosomes, tRNA and mRNA in Translation.]" title="Figure 11. Overview of Involvement of Ribosomes, tRNA and mRNA in Translation."&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 11. Overview of Involvement of Ribosomes, tRNA and mRNA in Translation." class="lightbox" src="assets/Tutorial17_translation1.jpg" style="width: 350px; height: 222px; margin: 10px;" title="Figure 11. Overview of Involvement of Ribosomes, tRNA and mRNA in Translation." /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;Polypeptide construction does not occur in the nucleus. The ribosomes, aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases and amino acids are located outside of the nucleus. Therefore, mRNA, rRNA and tRNA must all travel out of the nucleus before translation can begin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="lightbox lightbox-processed" assets/Tutorial17_translation2.jpg" id="Figure 12.  Initiation of Translation." rel="lightbox[][Figure 12.  Initiation of Translation.]" title="Figure 12.  Initiation of Translation."&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 12.  Initiation of Translation." class="lightbox" src="assets/Tutorial17_translation2.jpg" style="width: 350px; height: 400px; margin: 10px;" title="Figure 12.  Initiation of Translation." /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic concept of translation is depicted in the left image. See how mRNA, ribosomes, tRNA and amino acids all interact to make a polypeptide chain. Just like transcription, this takes place in three stages: initiation, elongation, and termination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;Initiation: In initiation, mRNA binds to the small subunit of a ribosome. An initiation codon, AUG, binds with an initiator tRNA molecule that bears the anticodon UAC and the amino acid methionine. Then a large subunit of a ribosome attaches, making the initiation complex complete and allowing translation to begin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="lightbox lightbox-processed" assets/Tutorial17_translation3.jpg" id="Figure 13. The Three Attachment Sites On a Ribosome." rel="lightbox[][Figure 13. The Three Attachment Sites On a Ribosome.]" title="Figure 13. The Three Attachment Sites On a Ribosome."&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 13. The Three Attachment Sites On a Ribosome." class="lightbox" src="assets/Tutorial17_translation3.jpg" style="width: 350px; height: 252px; margin: 10px;" title="Figure 13. The Three Attachment Sites On a Ribosome." /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This figure illustrates that there are actually three attachment sites on a ribosome. They are the exit site, the peptidyl-tRNA binding site, and the aminoacyl-tRNA binding site (also called the E, P, and A sites).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="lightbox lightbox-processed" assets/Tutorial17_translation4.jpg" id="Figure 14. Peptide Chain Elongation During Translation." rel="lightbox[][Figure 14. Peptide Chain Elongation During Translation.]" title="Figure 14. Peptide Chain Elongation During Translation."&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 14. Peptide Chain Elongation During Translation." class="lightbox" src="assets/Tutorial17_translation4.jpg" style="width: 350px; height: 253px; margin: 10px;" title="Figure 14. Peptide Chain Elongation During Translation." /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elongation: In the elongation stage, the peptide grows by addition of amino acids according to the sequence of bases in the mRNA molecule. This is accomplished through codon recognition, peptide bond formation, and translocation. Basically, a tRNA carrying the appropriate amino acid binds to the A-site, and a peptide bond forms between the new amino acid and the end of the growing polypeptide. Then everything shifts: the P-site tRNA is bumped to the E-site, where it dissociates from the ribosome; the A-site tRNA moves into the P-site; and a new aminoacyl-tRNA attaches to the now open A-site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Termination: Elongation continues until a mRNA &lt;strong&gt;stop codon&lt;/strong&gt;reaches the A-site of the ribosome. Stop codons include UAA, UAG and UGA, and they do not code for any amino acids. They signal the end of translation. Instead of a tRNA, a &lt;strong&gt;release factor protein&lt;/strong&gt; binds to the stop codon and the newly synthesized polypeptide is liberated from the ribosome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This new polypeptide will undergo coiling and folding to form its secondary and tertiary structures, and it might combine with additional polypeptide chains for its quaternary structure (go back and review protein structure, if necessary), hence finally making a protein.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Gene To Protein: Gene Regulation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recall that we discussed promoter regions of DNA and how these promoters bind specific proteins to initiate transcription, thereby setting the stage for protein synthesis. Different genes may have different promoters that respond to different transcription factor proteins. Gene regulation describes how genes can be &quot;turned on&quot; to synthesize a needed protein, or &quot;turned off&quot; to stop synthesis of a protein that is no longer needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Summary&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tutorial examined DNA replication, RNA transcription, and protein translation. These processes are pivotal to life, so it will be important that you have a firm grasp on the basic aspects of these processes (i.e., to the level presented in this tutorial).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All cells that divide need to replicate their DNA so that each daughter cell contains a full complement of all the parent&amp;#39;s genetic information. In the process of replication, the two strands are replicated with remarkable fidelity. To appreciate this process, keep a couple of things in mind. First, DNA is comprised of two antiparallel strands. The polarity of each strand is due to the manner in which the nucleotides are linked together. Second, DNA is synthesized in only one direction; 5&amp;#39; to 3&amp;#39;. Be sure that you understand that one strand is synthesized continuously, and that the other is synthesized discontinuously. Be sure that you understand why this is so, and be sure that you are familiar with the basic steps involved in this process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process of RNA transcription has some similarities to DNA replication (e.g., synthesis occurs in the 5&amp;#39; to 3&amp;#39; direction), but it also has some important differences. First, only one strand of DNA is used as a template for RNA synthesis. Second, ribonucleotides are used instead of deoxyribonucleotides. Not all DNA in a genome is transcribed at once. Rather, via the action of transcription factors, only selected genes are transcribed at a given time. Be sure that you understand the basic aspects of this process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protein translation is the process by which messenger RNA (mRNA) supplies the necessary information for the linear synthesis of proteins. There are three basic components to a cell&amp;#39;s translational machinery: mRNA, tRNA, and ribosomes. Messenger RNA provides the template that will be used for ordering the correct sequence of amino acids. Fidelity of the translational process is assured, in part, by the fact that each amino acid has its own transfer RNA. Transfer RNA (tRNA) is found with an appropriate amino acid. For example, a tRNA that has an anticodon of &quot;UAC&quot; will bind to the triplet on the mRNA with the complimentary sequence &quot;AUG.&quot; Thus, each tRNA delivers the appropriate amino acid to the ribosome; ordering of amino acids is determined by the linear arrangement of the genetic code. Be sure that you understand the relationship between these three components of the cell&amp;#39;s translational machinery.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

&lt;h2&gt;Introduction and Goals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has long been noted that offspring resemble their parents in many ways, and that many traits are passed from one generation to the next. This is evident in the physical similarities of siblings, and in offspring and their parents. Although there are definite similarities between parents and offspring (and between offspring), there also is variation. After all, children never look entirely like either of their parents because they have inherited traits from both parents. Variation between generations is an important feature of natural selection because it provides the genetic basis of differential reproductive success. This tutorial will examine how chromosomes are passed from parents to offspring, and how this process gives rise to genetic variation in offspring. By the end of this tutorial you should be familiar with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul style="text-align: justify;"&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Asexual and sexual reproduction&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Sexual life cycles&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Meiosis&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The two sources of genetic variation during meiosis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Types of Reproduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organisms reproduce in &lt;a class="highslide lightbox-processed" assets/Tutorial2_Figure%201%20Binary%20Fission.jpg" rel="lightbox[][Tutorial 2 Figure 1. Binary Fission]"&gt; &lt;img alt="Tutorial 2 Figure 1. Binary Fission" class="lightbox" src="assets/Tutorial2_Figure%201%20Binary%20Fission.jpg" style="float: right; height: 238px; width: 300px; margin: 10px;" title="Tutorial 2 Figure 1. Binary Fission" /&gt; &lt;/a&gt;one of two general ways: asexually or sexually. In &lt;strong&gt;asexual reproduction&lt;/strong&gt; individuals (e.g., bacteria, &lt;a class="ext" href="http://www.micrographia.com/specbiol/cnidari/hydrozo/hydr0100/hydra-00.htm" target="_blank" title="Hydra"&gt;&lt;span class="external-link"&gt;Hydra&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) produce genetically identical offspring termed &lt;strong&gt;clones&lt;/strong&gt;. For example, many plants can be cloned by vegetative propagation of root and stem cuttings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asexual reproduction is sometimes advantageous to organisms because it is generally quick and requires less energy. The major disadvantage of asexual reproduction is that offspring are genetically identical to the parent, and this lack of genetic variation may be detrimental if conditions change and genetic diversity becomes valuable. This situation could occur with the introduction of a new disease or predator, changing environmental conditions, or other factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;strong&gt;sexual reproduction&lt;/strong&gt; the genetic material from two parents combines to form offspring who are genetically distinct from their parents (and who are also distinct from other siblings produced by the same parents). Even though sexual reproduction requires more energy and time than asexual reproduction, it provides offspring with a unique genetic makeup that may provide them with a selective advantage in an unpredictable environment. The key to understanding how this genetic variation is maintained lies in examining the behavior of chromosomes during the sexual &lt;strong&gt;life cycle&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many of the organisms we will discuss, the exchange (or recombination) of genetic information is obligatorily coupled to reproduction, which is why such an organism is characterized as undergoing sexual reproduction. However, the exchange (or recombination) of genetic information is not always coupled to reproduction. For example, conjugation in bacteria can be accompanied by a brief exchange of genetic material without division; so, bacteria can engage in a form of sex (i.e., exchange of genetic material) known as conjugation and also undergo asexual reproduction (binary fission). Sex and reproduction are not always linked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 style="text-align: justify;"&gt;Chromosomes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The inheritance of traits is due to the transmission of &lt;strong&gt;genes&lt;/strong&gt; from parents to offspring, and these genes code for the physical similarities that we observe. A gene is a heritable unit. In cells, nuclear DNA is organized into chromosomes. Genes occupy specific positions on chromosomes. More than one form of a gene may exist, and these alternative forms of the gene (&lt;strong&gt;alleles&lt;/strong&gt;) result in the formation of slightly different proteins and enzymes that sometimes manifest themselves as differences in physical appearance, physiological functioning, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;a class="highslide lightbox-processed" assets/Tutorial2_Chromosome.jpg" rel="lightbox[][Chromosome Breakdown]"&gt;&lt;img alt="Chromosome Breakdown" class="lightbox" src="assets/Tutorial2_Chromosome.jpg" style="height: 388px; width: 300px; margin: 10px;" title="Chromosome Breakdown" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="highslide lightbox-processed" assets/Tutorial2_Compartive%20Scale%20of%20Mapping1.jpg" rel="lightbox[][Comparative Scale of Mapping]"&gt;&lt;img alt="Comparative Scale of Mapping" class="lightbox" src="assets/Tutorial2_Compartive%20Scale%20of%20Mapping1.jpg" style="float: right; height: 318px; width: 300px; margin: 10px;" title="Comparative Scale of Mapping" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;By passing chromosomes from parents to offspring, genes are transmitted from one generation to the next resulting in similarities between parents and offspring. All eukaryotic organisms have their genetic material subdivided into chromosomes, although the number of chromosomes differs by species (e.g., humans have 46 chromosomes, dogs have 78, cats have 34, and mosquitoes have only 6). Regardless of the number of chromosomes, the underlying principles of inheritance are the same for all species. To better understand the scale and relationship of nucleotide sequences, genes and chromosomes, examine the figure illustrating the Comparative Scale of Mapping on the right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;In normal humans, any cell that is not a sperm or ovum contains 46 chromosomes. These 46 chromosomes actually occur as 23 pairs of chromosomes, and the two chromosomes in a pair are identical in length and shape (except in males, who have one pair of nonidentical chromosomes: an X and a Y chromosome). The two chromosomes in the pair also have the same genes; if a gene for hair color is located at one location on one chromosome (commonly referred to as a locus; plural, loci), its &lt;strong&gt;homologous chromosome&lt;/strong&gt; will have the hair color gene at the same location. Importantly, the homologues may or may not have the same allele for the gene. This is because one homologue comes from each parent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Life Cycles&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="highslide lightbox-processed" assets/Tutorial2_Figure2TheHumanLifeCycle.jpg" rel="lightbox[][Figure 2. The Human Life Cycle]"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 2. The Human Life Cycle" class="lightbox" src="assets/Tutorial2_Figure2TheHumanLifeCycle.jpg" style="float: right; height: 263px; width: 300px; margin: 10px;" title="Figure 2. The Human Life Cycle" /&gt; &lt;/a&gt;This figure illustrates the human life cycle. Adults produce &lt;strong&gt;gametes&lt;/strong&gt; (reproductive cells termed sperm and eggs) by &lt;strong&gt;meiosis&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp; (a type of nuclear division), and each gamete contains only one-half the number of chromosomes found in the nonreproductive cells of the parent. The nonreproductive cells (containing 46 chromosomes) are called &lt;strong&gt;diploid cells&lt;/strong&gt;, and are abbreviated as &quot;2&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;.&quot; The gametes (containing 23 chromosomes) are called &lt;strong&gt;haploid cells&lt;/strong&gt;, and are abbreviated as &quot;&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;.&quot; When a haploid ovum and a haploid sperm unite through &lt;strong&gt;fertilization&lt;/strong&gt;, a diploid &lt;strong&gt;zygote&lt;/strong&gt; is produced. This life cycle describes how diploid (2&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;) adults produce haploid (&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;) gametes, which then unite to form a new diploid (2&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;) zygote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This alternation of meiosis and fertilization is found in the sexual life cycles of all sexually reproducing organisms, but its timing can differ considerably depending on the organism. The human life cycle typifies the most common life cycle found in animals, where the gametes are the only haploid cells. They combine to form a zygote, which divides by mitosis (another type of nuclear division) and grows to form a new individual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;In a second type of life cycle, as seen in most fungi and some protists (unicellular eukaryotes and their somewhat simple multicellular relatives), the diploid zygote produces haploid cells by meiosis; these develop into free-living, haploid multicellular organisms. These haploid organisms then produce modified gametes by mitosis (they are already haploid, therefore, they cannot undergo meiosis), and these gametes unite to form diploid zygotes. Some plants and algae exhibit yet another type of life cycle, which will be described when we discuss plants and algae later in this course. Although these three types of life cycles differ in the timing of fertilization and meiosis, they all produce genetic variation in their offspring. Next we will examine the process of meiosis and see how genetic variation arises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Meiosis&lt;a class="highslide lightbox-processed" assets/Tutorial2_Figure3Meiosis.jpg" rel="lightbox[][Figure 3. Meiosis]"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 3. Meiosis" class="lightbox" src="assets/Tutorial2_Figure3Meiosis.jpg" style="float: right; height: 180px; width: 300px; margin: 10px;" title="Figure 3. Meiosis" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organisms such as humans have two haploid sets of chromosomes, one set inherited from a male in the sperm and the second set from a female in the egg. Thus, we have a duplicate set of each of our 23 chromosomes. A pair of duplicate chromosomes is known as a homologous pair. Each generation, human males and females reduce their chromosome numbers in half, but must insure that each gamete has a complete set of half of the chromosomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The primary function of meiosis in diploid organisms is the proper distribution of homologous chromosomes. &lt;a class="highslide lightbox-processed" assets/Tutorial2_Meiosis.jpg" rel="lightbox[][Meiosis]"&gt;&lt;img alt="Meiosis" class="lightbox" src="assets/Tutorial2_Meiosis.jpg" style="float: left; height: 300px; margin: 10px; width: 223px;" title="Meiosis" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Meiosis has three essential phases, (1) pairing of homologous chromosomes, (2) locking of the chromosomes together via crossing over, and disjunction or segregation of the chromosomes into two daughter cells. As shown in this figure, cells go from the diploid to haploid state through an initial replication of chromosomes (resulting in &lt;strong&gt;sister chromatids&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;nonsister chromatids&lt;/strong&gt;), followed by two divisions called meiosis I and meiosis II. At the conclusion of meiosis, four daughter cells are formed, each with one-half the normal number of chromosomes. One consequence of meiosis isthat new genetic diversity arises due to two factors: the independent assortment of homologous chromosomes to gametes, and crossing over (recombination) in prophase I of meiosis. Before we examine these two factors, you must first familiarize yourself with the process of meiosis. To do so, view the illustrations of meiosis on the right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that you are familiar with meiosis, let&amp;#39;s examine the factors that lead to genetic diversity in this process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Independent Assortment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="highslide lightbox-processed" assets/Tutorial2_Figure4MeiosisI.jpg" rel="lightbox[][Figure 4. Meiosis I]"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 4. Meiosis I" class="lightbox" src="assets/Tutorial2_Figure4MeiosisI.jpg" style="float: right; height: 271px; width: 300px; margin: 10px;" title="Figure 4. Meiosis I" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The first source of genetic variation, &lt;strong&gt;independent assortment&lt;/strong&gt;, occurs in metaphase I, when the homologous chromosomes line up on the metaphase plate. Orientation of the pairs is random; therefore, which chromosome (maternal or paternal) goes to each daughter cell is random. A particular daughter cell has a 50% chance of getting either the maternal or paternal chromosome for each homologous pair. This figure illustrates two pairs of homologous chromosomes and how their random alignment at the metaphase plate can lead to different combinations of chromosomes in the daughter cells that are produced. The chromosome pairs align independently of one another. Therefore, the number of different combinations of chromosomes in the daughter cells is equal to 2&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;, where n = the haploid number of chromosomes (or the number of chromosome pairs). In this example there are two chromosomes, so there are 2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 4 different chromosome combinations in the daughter cells. If we look at the whole human genetic complement (n = 23), the number of different combinations is 2&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt; = 8,388,608. Due only to the independent assortment of chromosomes in meiosis I, over 8 million genetically distinct gametes can be produced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When making these computations, calculate the number of possibilities using the number of pairs, not the total number of chromosomes; remember that sex chromosomes are not homologous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 style="text-align: justify;"&gt;Crossing Over&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="highslide lightbox-processed" assets/Tutorial2_Figure5CrossingOver.jpg" rel="lightbox[][Figure 5. Crossing Over]"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 5. Crossing Over" class="lightbox" src="assets/Tutorial2_Figure5CrossingOver.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 10px; width: 485px; height: 200px;" title="Figure 5. Crossing Over" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;A second source of genetic variation during meiosis is the exchange of genetic material between the maternal and paternal chromosomes, a process called &lt;strong&gt;crossing over&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;recombination&lt;/strong&gt;. While the homologous chromosomes are paired together in prophase I, pieces of one chromosome may be exchanged with the identical portion of the other chromosome. This means that the resulting chromosomes are not entirely maternal or paternal, but rather a mixture of both. In humans, crossing over occurs about 2-3 times per chromosome pair, between nonsister chromatids only (not between sister chromatids).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;View the animation to reinforce the concept of crossing over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As previously described, meiosis gives rise to genetic variation through the independent assortment of chromosomes and recombination between pairs of homologous chromosomes. If we also consider random fertilization, the amount of genetic variation increases more. Let&amp;#39;s consider the example of a human couple having a child. Over 8 million different genetic combinations are possible in the father&amp;#39;s sperm, and an equal number in the mother&amp;#39;s ovum. The number of unique genetic combinations would be (8 million)(8 million) = 64 trillion when a sperm and ovum randomly unite to form a zygote. Therefore, sexual reproduction is an effective way to create offspring with genetic variation. Why is this important?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Populations evolve through natural selection. In order for natural selection to operate, genetic variation must be present. Genetic variation leads to heterogeneity between generations; if the environment favors one variant, then this advantageous variant will increase in frequency over generational time. If environmental conditions change, individuals migrate, or new predators or pathogens are introduced, then genetic variation may enable some individuals to do better in these new conditions. Therefore, genetic variation is &quot;insurance&quot; for organisms against changing conditions because it helps to insure that some of their offspring will survive if conditions change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tutorial demonstrated how traits are passed from one generation to the next. In each generation, sexually reproducing eukaryotes undergo a series of reproductive events that can be summarized by a life cycle. There are some differences in the details of various life cycles, but in essence the life cycle describes how the genetic composition of the cells involved in reproduction alternates between a 1n (haploid) and 2n (diploid) state. Superficially, this seems simple and straightforward; that is, two haploid gametes fuse (at some point in the life cycle), resulting in a diploid (2n) organism; one or more cells in this 2n organism then (at some point) undergo meiosis, giving rise to haploid gametes that potentially go on to form the next generation, etc. However, this is only part of the importance of the life cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mechanisms involved in the haploid/diploid/haploid transitions lead to genetic variation. All eukaryotic organisms have the majority of their DNA arranged in a set of chromosomes (found within the nucleus). Humans have 46 chromosomes (2n). Our gametes have 23 chromosomes (1n). Each of us received half of our chromosomes from each parent. However, the combination of 23 chromosomes received from each of our parents was not the same complement that our siblings received (which explains why most siblings look similar but nonidentical). This scenario provides a major source of variation between generations (as does crossing over between paternal and maternal chromosomes).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of our 23 haploid chromosomes has a similar but nonidentical partner termed a homologue. It is essential to remember that homologues are not identical. Therefore, the diploid composition can be described as 23 pairs of homologous chromosomes. During meiosis, these homologues will be segregated into four progeny cells, each of which will have a haploid chromosome complement. The cellular process by which these similar, yet nonidentical, chromosomes are physically moved during meiosis results in a random distribution of the 23 chromosomes into the haploid cells. Because this process occurs randomly, we can use statistics to predict the number of possible outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In metaphase I of meiosis, the replicated chromosomes appear situated in a row with the homologues lined up opposite one another. Importantly, how they pair is random. For example, the paternal homologue of chromosome 1 may line up on one side, whereas the paternal homologue of chromosome 2 may line up on the other side (remember, then the maternal pair would be on opposite sides as well). The odds that the paternal member of a given homologous pair lines up on one side is equal to 50% (or 0.5 or 1:1); i.e., it goes either on one side or the other. The odds that the paternal members of two chromosomes line up on the same side is then a product of their individual probabilities; i.e., 0.5 x 0.5 = 0.25 (or 1:4). What would be the odds of all 23 paternal chromosomes lining up on one side? The solution is 2&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt; or 1 in 8 million. This is also the odds of any other specific combination occurring during metaphase I. In metaphase II, the segregated homologues will separate. There is only one way this will occur, so the probabilities outlined for the events at metaphase I can be extended to the entire process of meiosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s put together the events occurring during meiosis for both parents. If the combination for a specific arrangement of chromosomes in each parent is 8 million, what are the odds of a specific diploid arrangement occurring? (Fertilization is somewhat random and therefore can be described statistically.) Again, the probability is a product of their independent probabilities, which is 8 million x 8 million = 64 trillion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;The process of random segregation of chromosomes during meiosis provides for an incredible amount of potential variation. Crossing over in prophase I adds another level of variation to the genetic character of gametes, and this will be explored in more detail later.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

			&lt;/tr&gt;
		&lt;/tbody&gt;
	&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Introduction and Goals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, we have dealt with the behavior of genes between generations and focused on the phenotypes of individuals. Next we&amp;#39;ll take a broader look at genetics and see how the genetics of populations are studied. As you will learn, the behavior of populations in response to their environments brings about evolutionary change. In fact, evolutionary change is determined by changes in the genetic composition of a population. The field of population genetics spans the disciplines of genetics and evolution. By the end of this tutorial you should have a working understanding of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Population genetics&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;How to define a species&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;How genetic variation in a population is studied&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The Hardy-Weinberg equation&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The factors that influence changes in allele frequencies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Population Genetics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;population&lt;/strong&gt; is a group of organisms that are members of the same species and that live in the same geographical area. While natural selection occurs at the level of the individual, through variations in fitness among individuals, evolution occurs at the population level. The reason for this is demonstrated in the following table:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;table align="center" border="2" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1" frame="border" style="border: 2px solid rgb(0, 51, 153);"&gt;

			&lt;tr&gt;
				&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
				&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Individual&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
				&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Population&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;/tr&gt;
			&lt;tr&gt;
				&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Life Span&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
				&lt;td&gt;One generation&lt;/td&gt;
				&lt;td&gt;Many generations&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;/tr&gt;
			&lt;tr&gt;
				&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Genetic Characterization&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
				&lt;td&gt;Genotype&lt;/td&gt;
				&lt;td&gt;Allele frequencies&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;/tr&gt;
			&lt;tr&gt;
				&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Genetic Variability&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
				&lt;td&gt;None&lt;/td&gt;
				&lt;td&gt;Considerable&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;/tr&gt;
			&lt;tr&gt;
				&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evolution&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
				&lt;td&gt;None&lt;/td&gt;
				&lt;td&gt;Can change over time&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;/tr&gt;
		&lt;/tbody&gt;
	&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The genotype of an individual is, for the most part, determined at the moment of fertilization and cannot be changed during that individual&amp;#39;s lifetime. However, because populations are comprised of many individuals from different generations, the allele frequencies in a population can change over time; if so, evolution may be occurring. Population geneticists focus their studies in two areas. The first area is the measurement of genetic variation within a population. Morphological characters (e.g., variations in length, weight, coloration) and molecular characters (e.g., variations in nucleotide sequences of DNA or in amino acid sequences of proteins) are examined and quantified. The second area is the examination of the mechanisms by which genetic variation changes over space and time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The evolutionary forces that can influence allele frequencies will be examined in &lt;a assets/Tutorial_10_Genetic_Change_in_Population.pdf"&gt;Tutorial 10&lt;/a&gt;. In this tutorial we will examine how allele frequencies are used to make predictions about the genotypes of a population.&lt;/p&gt;

What is a species? This is a difficult question to answer and, in fact, tutorial 12 will focus on this topic. The problem in defining a species is that no single definition works for all cases. In this class we will use the biological species concept as our working definition. This concept defines a &lt;strong&gt;species&lt;/strong&gt; as a group of potentially interbreeding individuals that can produce fertile offspring. This potential to interbreed means that individuals can move between populations, therefore, there is &lt;strong&gt;gene flow&lt;/strong&gt; (really allele flow, because all members of a species have the same genes) between populations. Reproductive isolation from other species results in a &lt;strong&gt;gene pool&lt;/strong&gt; that is closed to alleles from other species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A species occupies an area termed its &lt;strong&gt;range&lt;/strong&gt;. The &lt;a class="ext" href="http://bna.birds.cornell.edu/bna/species/064/galleries/figures/figure-1" rel="_blank" target="_blank"&gt;Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology&lt;/a&gt; identifies the ranges of some different species of birds in North America, such as Harris&amp;#39;s sparrow. At this site, notice that the range maps cover land and water habitats. However, it is important to note that a species is usually restricted to specific habitats within its geographic range. For example, the map to the left from the Northern Prairies Wildlife Research Center shows that the entire state of Pennsylvania is part of the range of the bullfrog (&lt;em&gt;Rana catesbieana&lt;/em&gt;); however, bullfrogs are not found on the Penn State, University Park campus. This is because bullfrog populations are found in bodies of water (e.g., ponds or lakes), therefore, they occupy only some of the habitats within their range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Genetic Variation&lt;/h1&gt;

Black Squirrel" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;As previously mentioned, population geneticists measure the amount of genetic variation found within a species. Variations can be measured within a population and between populations. When there is no variation among the members of a population, the population is &lt;strong&gt;monomorphic&lt;/strong&gt; for that particular character; monomorphic means that just one form exists. For example, the population of squirrels (&lt;em&gt;Sciurus carolinensis&lt;/em&gt;) on the Penn State campus is monomorphic; all of the squirrels in this population have gray fur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this is not true of all squirrel populations. At Kent State, the squirrel population is &lt;strong&gt;polymorphic&lt;/strong&gt; for fur color (i.e., they have either gray or black fur).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="lightbox lightbox-processed" assets/Tutorial 9 Figure 4. Snail Shells.jpg" id="Figure 4. Snail Shells" rel="lightbox[][Figure 4. Snail Shells]" title="Figure 4. Snail Shells"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 4. Snail Shells" class="lightbox" src="assets/Tutorial%209%20Figure%204.%20Snail%20Shells.jpg" style="float: left; width: 256px; height: 381px; margin: 10px;" title="Figure 4. Snail Shells" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Variations in some populations for a given character can be extreme (as is seen in this picture showing the variation of shell colors in a species of Caribbean snail).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other factors, besides genetics, can contribute to the variation of a character within a population. For example, phenotypes can be affected by the environment. When you spend a lot of time in the sun, your skin becomes darker than what was predetermined by your genotype. As you learned, the PKU disease can be suppressed by diet. Other examples of environmental alterations are all around us. No two trees look exactly alike because branching patterns and leaf and limb numbers can be influenced by light, water, and nutrient availability. In humans, IQ and size have been linked to neonatal and youth diets. In short, the environment can influence how genetic information is expressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Genetic Composition of a Population&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previously we examined the genotypes of individuals and how they relate to the phenotypes expressed in subsequent generations. Keep in mind, the genotype of an individual becomes fixed the moment that two gametes unite to form the diploid zygote (barring mutation). However, a population consists of a group of individuals who may differ genotypically from one another. How do we describe the genotype of a population?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The genetic makeup of a population can be described by the frequency of alleles that exist in that population. This is typically expressed as a fractional equivalent of one. In other words, a population that has only one allele for a particular gene has an allele frequency of one for that allele. If two or more alleles for a particular gene exist, then each has an allele frequency that is some fraction of one (however, they all must add up to one). In the example of cystic fibrosis, the major CF allele is found at a frequency of 0.04 (4%). This means that the wild-type allele is found at a frequency of 0.96 (96%). Note that 0.96 + 0.04 = 1. Although the number of alleles may be quite variable (some genes have dozens of alleles), the simple arithmetic relationship still applies; that is, the frequencies of alleles for a given gene must add up to one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously a population can have many genes for which alternative alleles exist. In the human population, about 30% of all genes have two or more alleles. In other words, 70% of the genes are fixed (have an allele frequency of one), whereas 30% of the genes have allele frequencies less than one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Probability and Populations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The behavior of alternative (and sometimes deleterious) alleles found in human populations can be found in &lt;a href="https://online.science.psu.edu/biol110_sandbox_2381/node/8976" title="Tutorial 6 - Pedigree Analysis"&gt;Tutorial 6&lt;/a&gt;. Let&amp;#39;s take a closer look at these alleles and see how the genetic composition of a population is studied. Allele frequencies can be calculated if one knows phenotypic frequencies (and vice versa).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About one in fifty persons of Caucasian ancestry are carriers of PKU. We learned that the number of affected individuals can be calculated by first calculating the odds of two carriers meeting and having children (50 x 50 = 2500 = 1:2500). Because PKU is a recessive mutation, the odds that these carriers will have an affected child is 1:4. Putting these calculations together (2500 x 4 = 10,000) means that the odds of two carriers meeting and having an affected child is 1:10,000 (using the Rule of Multiplication). At the population level this means that 1:10,000 is the frequency of the disease, and indeed, this is the case; for every 10,000 births, one Caucasian child (on average) has PKU. The logic behind these numbers should be clear. If not, review &lt;a href="https://online.science.psu.edu/biol110_sandbox_2381/node/8992"&gt;Tutorial 5&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How are allele frequencies actually determined? The &lt;strong&gt;Hardy-Weinberg equation&lt;/strong&gt; can be used to calculate allele frequencies. For example, let&amp;#39;s apply the equation to PKU disease and designate the PKU allele &quot;q,&quot; and the wild-type allele &quot;p.&quot; What is the allele frequency for the PKU allele?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The frequency of individuals that are homozygous for the PKU allele in a population is q X q = q2. You should recognize this as the Rule of Multiplication. You should also know that q2 represents the PKU-affected individuals in the population because they are homozygous for q. The frequency of individuals that have homozygous wild-type alleles (the p allele) in a population is p X p = p2. The frequency of individuals that are heterozygous in a population (PKU carriers) is p X q = pq. Note, there are two ways to get this last calculation (depending on which parent donates the q allele); therefore, the Rule of Addition is used to compute the odds of being heterozygous (pq + pq = 2pq).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a population, the frequency of PKU individuals that are homozygous for the allele + those who are heterozygous for the allele + those who are homozygous for the wild-type allele = 1. In other words, p2 + 2pq + q2 = 1. This is the Hardy-Weinberg equation. (You may also recognize this as a binomial expansion.) Before going on, be sure you understand what these terms represent and how to derive any term given the other two terms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, let&amp;#39;s solve our original PKU problem. Restated, what is the allele frequency for the PKU allele (q)? We know that the phenotypic frequency of PKU disease is 1:10,000 or 0.0001. Remember that this is the phenotypic frequency, but we want to determine the allele frequency for the PKU allele (q). Recognize that q2 is the phenotypic frequency (affected individuals) in the Hardy-Weinberg equation. Therefore, the square root of the phenotypic frequency will equal the allele frequency of the PKU allele. The square root of 0.0001 is 0.01.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because the wild-type allele (p) + the PKU allele (q) must equal one (p + q = 1), we can determine the wild-type allele frequency. 1.0 - 0.01 = 0.99 = wild-type allele frequency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Applying the Hardy-Weinberg Equation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let&amp;#39;s try a problem using the squirrels from Kent State, which were described earlier in this tutorial. Take out a piece of paper and work along with the following description.&amp;nbsp; The key to understanding the equation is writing it out yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose that you have decided to visit Kent State for the weekend to see these squirrels for yourself. You want to determine the frequency of black (&lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt;) and gray (&lt;em&gt;b&lt;/em&gt;) alleles in the squirrel population. Since it is not possible to see all of the squirrels on campus, you decide to count 100 squirrels and use this as your sample to determine the allele frequencies. By the end of the day you have scored 100 squirrels; 84 were black and 16 were gray. Next you need to use the Hardy-Weinberg equation to determine the frequency of these two alleles in this population. At first you decide that the allele frequencies are 0.84 for the &lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt; allele and 0.16 for the &lt;em&gt;b&lt;/em&gt; allele. Is this correct? Are you overlooking something? When you see a black squirrel, what is its genotype? Black squirrels are either &lt;em&gt;BB&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Bb&lt;/em&gt;. So some black squirrels are carrying the &lt;em&gt;b&lt;/em&gt; allele. Black is a complete dominant, therefore, there is no way to tell which squirrels are heterozygous for this allele.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since you do not know if a black squirrel has a &lt;em&gt;BB&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Bb&lt;/em&gt; genotype, you cannot use the number of black squirrels to determine the frequency of the black allele. But what about gray squirrels? Since gray is recessive to black, all of the gray squirrels are genotype &lt;em&gt;bb&lt;/em&gt;, or they represent the q2 value in the p2 + 2pq + q2 equation. Suddenly this is looking much easier. If q2 = 16/100 = 0.16, then q = the square root of 0.16 = 0.4. Since p + q = 1, then 1 - q = p, so 1 - 0.4 = 0.6 = p. So the frequency of the black allele (&lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt;) is 0.6 and the frequency of the gray allele (&lt;em&gt;b&lt;/em&gt;) is 0.4. Now that you have this information, you can estimate the frequencies of the different genotypes in the population: &lt;em&gt;BB&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Bb&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;bb&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Multiple Alleles&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;All of the cases that we have examined have had a single gene with two alleles. But what about genes that have three or more alleles? Basically this is dealt with in the same way, but the determination of allele frequencies becomes a bit more involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The human ABO blood group system was discussed in &lt;a href="https://online.science.psu.edu/biol110_sandbox_2381/node/8992"&gt;Tutorial 5&lt;/a&gt;. This was used as an example of a gene with multiple alleles (IA, IIB, &lt;em&gt;i&lt;/em&gt;) and codominance because both alleles are expressed in AB heterozygous individuals. The O allele (designated as &lt;em&gt;i&lt;/em&gt;) is recessive to the IA and IB alleles. In the human population, the IA allele has a frequency of 0.3 and the IB allele has a frequency of 0.1. Pull out a piece of paper and a pencil and write down these numbers. In the next few questions you will learn how three alleles can be handled by the Hardy-Weinberg equation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may take you some time to get through these questions. They are tough, but once you understand the logic behind their solutions, you will be able to handle similar questions with ease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="lightbox lightbox-processed" assets/Tutorial5_Figure 4 ABO Blood Groups.jpg" id="Figure 5. ABO Blood Group" rel="lightbox[][Figure 5. ABO Blood Group]" title="Figure 5. ABO Blood Group"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 5. ABO Blood Group" class="lightbox" src="assets/Tutorial5_Figure%204%20ABO%20Blood%20Groups.jpg" style="width: 200px; height: 317px; margin: 10px;" title="Figure 5. ABO Blood Group" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Using the Hardy-Weinberg Equation in Evolutionary Studies&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should now appreciate how the Hardy-Weinberg equation can be used to study the genetic composition of a population. But how does this fit into evolution studies?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer is that changes in allele frequencies are the most fundamental indication that evolution might be occurring. If two populations of the same species have the same allele frequency for a given gene, it can be concluded that natural selection is not operating on that gene (at least at that time). On the other hand, if the allele frequencies are different for a given gene, then natural selection may be operative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Importantly, natural selection is only one factor that can influence changes in allele frequencies. At least four other factors can also affect a change in allele frequency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First is a small population size. If the population is small, then random changes in the gene pool (&lt;strong&gt;genetic drift&lt;/strong&gt;) can alter the allele frequency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second is migration/immigration. If individuals migrate into or immigrate out of a given population, they can affect the allele frequency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third are mutations. Spontaneous mutations create new alleles, and these can affect allele frequencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fourth are nonrandom matings. If mate selection is not random (for a particular gene), then this can alter the allele frequency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In practice, if population geneticists see a change in the allele frequency for a given allele and if they can eliminate these four factors, then natural selection is likely responsible for the observed change. If allele frequencies remain stable between generations, then the population is considered to be in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tutorial covered the basic principles of population genetics. A population is a group of organisms that are members of the same biological species and that live in the same geographic area. There can be gene flow between different populations of a biological species, however, this reproductive isolation creates a gene pool that excludes alleles entering from other species. Characters in a population can be monomorphic, showing no variation, or polymorphic, having at least two different variants. Variation can be caused by the organism&amp;#39;s genotype or by environmental effects. The Hardy-Weinberg equation can be used to examine genetic variation within populations. In the case of two alleles for a gene, the sum of the frequency of the alleles equals 1 or 100%. This is represented by the equation p + q = 1. To determine the frequencies of the three possible genotypes, use the equation p2 + 2pq + q2 = 1. When the allele frequencies stay the same between generations, the population is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium requires that allele frequencies within a population remain the same from one generation to the next, as long as certain conditions (including no mutation and no natural selection) are met. The next tutorial will explore the evolutionary forces that can cause changes in allele and/or genotype frequencies in a population; that is, changes that lead to microevolution.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

The &lt;strong&gt;Punnett square&lt;/strong&gt; is a useful tool for predicting the genotypes and phenotypes of offspring in a genetic cross involving Mendelian traits. Constructing a Punnett square is quite easy, as demonstrated by the Web sites below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Interpreting the Results of a Punnett Square&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key to understanding Punnett squares is in realizing that the expected types of offspring are probabilities. The Punnett square is useful because it calculates the probability of producing each of the genotypes or phenotypes for any one offspring. Let&amp;#39;s look at an example. A self-pollination of F1 hybrids for flower color (&lt;em&gt;Pp&lt;/em&gt;) gives a 3:1 ratio of purple:white flowers in t&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;he offspring. This means that 75% of the offspring are predicted to have purple flowers and 25% white flowers. It also means that for every offspring produced, that offspring has a 75% chance of having purple flowers and a 25% chance of having white flowers. Therefore, one would expect the number of offspring with a particular trait to be equal to the probability multiplied by &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;, the number of offspring. As you learned in the last tutorial when working with ratios, if you are given the ratio and the total number of offspring counted, you can convert the ratio to a probability and predict the number of offspring with each trait.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Test Crosses&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="highslide" assets/Tutorial4_Figure 2 A test cross.jpg" onclick="return hs.expand(this)" style="float: right; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px;" title="Figure 2.

A Test Cross" src="assets/Tutorial4_Figure%202%20A%20test%20cross.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 408px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;test cross&lt;/strong&gt; is used to determine the genotype of an individual with a dominant trait. Because the trait is dominant, an individual exhibiting the trait could be homozygous or heterozygous for the trait. (This cannot be determined by simply looking at the phenotype of the individual.) In a test cross, an individual with the dominant phenotype is crossed with a fully recessive individual. As shown in this figure, there are two possible outcomes (depending on the genotype of the parent). By examining the offspring of the cross, the unknown genotype of the dominant parent can be determined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Dihybrid Crosses&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Constructing a Punnett square for a &lt;strong&gt;dihybrid cross&lt;/strong&gt; is similar to the method used for a monohybrid cross. Determine the alleles produced by each parent, draw the Punnett square, and then combine the gametes for each cell. The following Web sites should help to demonstrate the process more clearly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Meiosis: The Mechanism for Segregation of Alleles&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recall from&amp;nbsp; &lt;a href="https://online.science.psu.edu/biol110_sandbox_2381/node/8934" target="_blank" title="Tutorial 2 - Heredity and Life Cycles"&gt;Tutorial 2: Heredity and Life Cycles Tutorial&lt;/a&gt;, that homologous chromosomes pair during prophase 1 of meiosis, and later, each member of the pair will be packaged into separate gametes. Therefore, alleles on homologous chromosomes will segregate during meiosis I (&lt;strong&gt;The Law of Segregation&lt;/strong&gt;), and if the genes for different characters reside on different chromosomes (or are far apart on the same chromosome), they will independently assort during meiosis as well (&lt;strong&gt;The Law of Independent Assortment&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;object data="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2093171" height="480" hspace="10" style="width: 640px; height: 480px;" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" vspace="10" width="640"&gt;&lt;param name="quality" value="high" /&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2093171" /&gt;&lt;param name="data" value="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2093171" /&gt;&lt;param name="wmode" value="transparent" /&gt;&lt;param name="src" value="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2093171" /&gt;&lt;param name="align" value="left" /&gt;&lt;param name="vspace" value="10" /&gt;&lt;param name="hspace" value="10" /&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the connection between genes and chromosomes started to become more clear in the years after Mendel&amp;#39;s death, scientists noted what seemed to be a paradox in Mendel&amp;#39;s Law of Independent Assortment and the behavior of chromosomes during gamete formation. Complex organisms must have huge numbers of genes to govern their biochemical processes, and yet, the number of chromosomes in these organisms is often small. For example, humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes, whereas pea plants have 7 pairs. Therefore, one must conclude that each chromosome houses many genes. But if there are many genes on each chromosome, how can two genes on the same chromosome independently assort from one another? The chromosome doesn&amp;#39;t break apart during meiosis; therefore, there must be another explanation. The answer is that some genes are physically linked to one another by residing on the same chromosome, but they appear to independently assort because they frequently recombine (exchange genetic material) with one another. The frequency with which they do this enables scientists to &quot;map&quot; gene locations on chromosomes. We will examine recombination in greater detail in upcoming exercises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Using Probability&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the alleles for different characters assort randomly from one another, probability can be used to mathematically predict the outcomes of genetic crosses involving one or more characters. Although Punnett squares are an effective and straightforward way to examine simple genetic crosses, they are unwieldy and time consuming when the inheritance of multiple characters is examined. A more effective way to examine inheritance is to use two basic laws of probability (The Rule of Multiplication and The Rule of Addition) to determine the probabilities mathematically. A little background on probability will aid in your understanding. Probability scales range from 0 to 1. An event that is certain to occur has a value of 1, whereas an event that is certain not to occur has a value of 0. When you flip a coin, the probability of getting heads is 1/2 or 0.50, and the probability for getting tails is also 1/2 or 0.50. If you are rolling a single die, the probability of rolling a 1 is 1/6 or 0.17, as is the probability of rolling any other number on the die.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the outcome of a probability event is unaffected by what has happened in previous trials, it is an independent event. When you roll a die, the chance of rolling a 1 is always 1/6, regardless of what you rolled previously. A lottery drawing, on the other hand, is an example of a non-independent event. If balls numbered 1 through 36 are placed in the lottery machine and mixed, the odds of getting any of the numbers is 1/36 on the first number drawn. However, on the second number, the odds decline to 1/35 because the removal of the first ball has affected the odds on the second number. For our purposes, we will be working almost entirely with independent events; however, it is important to understand the distinction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Rule of Multiplication&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This figure shows the role of probability when estimating offspring genotypes in Mendelian genetics. The chance of getting a particular offspring requires two independent events to occur: the segregation of alleles into ova, and the segregation of alleles into sperm. In this example, each of the parents is heterozygous for flower color (&lt;em&gt;Pp&lt;/em&gt;); because the two alleles in each individual segregate randomly during meiosis, the chance of getting either a &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; allele in an ova or sperm is 50%. To form an offspring with a particular genotype, the appropriate gametes must come together. The probability of this happening is determined by multiplying the probabilities of the two independent events that must occur to give the desired outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the example given, the chance of getting a homozygous dominant offspring (&lt;em&gt;PP&lt;/em&gt;) would be equal to the chance of getting a &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; allele in the ova (50%) multiplied by the chance of getting a &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; allele in the sperm (50%). Much like flipping two coins in the hope of both coming up heads, the probability of getting an offspring of this genotype would be (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4. The same would be true of an offspring with a &lt;em&gt;pp&lt;/em&gt; genotype, as the probability of getting two &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; alleles would also be (1/2) (1/2) = 1/4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These examples demonstrate the &lt;strong&gt;Rule of Multiplication&lt;/strong&gt;, which allows one to calculate the probability of two or more independent events occurring together in a specific combination. To determine the probability of an event occurring, determine the individual probabilities of each independent event, then multiply the individual probabilities to obtain the probability of these events occurring together. Some non-genetic examples should help to clarify this concept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(a) What is the probability of getting heads three times in a row when flipping a coin?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probability of getting heads on one flip = 1/2&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probability of getting heads on three consecutive flips = (1/2) (1/2)(1/2) = 1/8&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(b) What is the probability of rolling a six on two consecutive rolls of a die?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probability of getting a six on one roll = 1/6&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probability of getting a six on two consecutive rolls = (1/6)(1/6) = 1/36&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Rule of Addition&lt;object align="right" data="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2093807" height="480" hspace="10" style="width: 640px; height: 480px;" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" vspace="10" width="640"&gt;&lt;param name="quality" value="high" /&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2093807" /&gt;&lt;param name="data" value="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2093807" /&gt;&lt;param name="wmode" value="transparent" /&gt;&lt;param name="src" value="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2093807" /&gt;&lt;param name="align" value="right" /&gt;&lt;param name="vspace" value="10" /&gt;&lt;param name="hspace" value="10" /&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rule of Multiplication works well when there is only one way to arrive at a particular outcome, but what if the outcome can occur in different ways? For example, what is the probability of getting an offspring with the genotype &lt;em&gt;Pp&lt;/em&gt; in the cross shown in this figure? Notice that there are two ways to get this genotype: a &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; from the ova and a &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; from the sperm, and vice versa. To calculate this probability, use the &lt;strong&gt;Rule of Addition&lt;/strong&gt;. This rule states that if an event can occur in more than one way, the probability of that event occurring is equal to the sum of the probabilities of each way the event can occur. As depicted here, the probability of getting an offspring with the genotype &lt;em&gt;Pp&lt;/em&gt; is equal to the probability of getting &lt;em&gt;Pp&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; from the ova, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; from the sperm) plus the probability of getting &lt;em&gt;pP&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; from the ova, &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; from the sperm). Therefore, the probability would be 1/4 + 1/4 = 2/4 = 1/2. This example demonstrates how both the Rule of Multiplication and the Rule of Addition can be used to predict the outcome of genetic crosses. To ensure that you understand the Rule of Addition, here is a non-genetic example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is the probability of getting heads, at least once, in two flips of a coin? There are three possible ways to do this: heads on both flips, heads on the first flip, or heads on the second flip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(a) Use the Rule of Multiplication to calculate the probabilities of each event that satisfies the conditions of the question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probability of getting heads on first flip, heads on second flip = (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probability of getting heads on first flip, tails on second flip = (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probability of getting tails on first flip, heads on second flip = (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(b) Use the Rule of Addition to calculate the overall probability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probability of getting heads, at least once, in two flips of a coin = 1/4 (heads on the first flip, tails second) + 1/4 (tails first, heads second) + 1/4 (heads both times) = 3/4&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;object data="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2093869" height="480" hspace="10" style="width: 640px; height: 480px;" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" vspace="10" width="640"&gt;&lt;param name="quality" value="high" /&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2093869" /&gt;&lt;param name="data" value="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2093869" /&gt;&lt;param name="wmode" value="transparent" /&gt;&lt;param name="src" value="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2093869" /&gt;&lt;param name="align" value="left" /&gt;&lt;param name="vspace" value="10" /&gt;&lt;param name="hspace" value="10" /&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The phenotype of an organism arises from the complex interactions of many character traits. In a dihybrid cross two character traits can segregate in several ways, with each leading to a different phenotype. How can one predict the likelihood of the different phenotypes from a dihybrid cross? This becomes relatively straightforward, providing each character trait behaves in a Mendelian fashion; that is, a simple dominant-recessive expression pattern. If the character traits are located on different chromosomes, they will segregate independently from each other. This means that the separate probabilities of each character trait can be predicted, as with a monohybrid cross. It follows then that the probabilities of these different phenotypes occurring simultaneously in the same plant will be the product of their probabilities occurring alone. In other words, if a purple/round seeded plant that is heterozygous for both characters is crossed with itself (&quot;selfing&quot;), then the probability of observing round/seeded progeny will be 0.75 x 0.75 = 0.56. Be sure that you understand the logic behind this prediction and how it was calculated. Also, if there are more than two ways a given genotype can arise, then the probability is the sum of each way it can arise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relatively few character traits are inherited in a simple Mendelian manner. There are a number of other basic patterns of inheritance that have been described, including incomplete dominance, codominance, multiple alleles, pleiotropy, epistasis and polygenic inheritance. These will be discussed in &lt;a href="https://online.science.psu.edu/biol110_sandbox_2381/node/8992" target="_blank" title="The Complex Expression Patterns of Multiple="&gt;Tutorial 5: The Complex Expression Patterns of Multiple Alleles&lt;/a&gt; tutorial.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <title>Tutorial 6: Pedigree Analysis</title>
    <body>&lt;h2&gt;Terms&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should have a working knowledge of the following terms:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;carrier&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;pedigree&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Introduction and Goals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genetics is not an abstract science. You probably can see inheritance patterns in your own family. Usually these patterns relate to ear shape, eye color and hair color, etc. This tutorial will show you how a pedigree analysis can provide insight into the genotype of relatives. You will also look at some of the more common human genetic diseases. By the time you finish this tutorial you should have a basic working knowledge of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Pedigree analysis&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Cystic fibrosis&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Huntington&amp;#39;s disease&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Sickle-cell disease&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Phenylketonuria&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The inheritance of dominant and recessive traits&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mendelian Inheritance in Humans&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mendelian inheritance in humans is difficult to study because humans produce relatively few offspring (as compared to most other species) and they have a generation time of about 20 years. These two factors, not to mention ethical issues, make it impossible to design breeding experiments using humans. Nonetheless, there are few traits that are passed on by Mendelian inheritance (e.g., dimples, freckles, and hairlines).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Pedigrees&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our understanding of Mendelian inheritance in humans is based on the analysis of matings that have already occurred (the opposite of planned experiments), a family &lt;strong&gt;pedigree&lt;/strong&gt;. Human pedigrees describe the interrelationships between parents and children, over generations, regarding a specific trait. Mendel&amp;#39;s laws of inheritance can be used to analyze the pedigree and genotypes of the individuals in the pedigree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to read family pedigrees, it is important to understand the conventions of pedigrees; as shown on the &lt;a class="external-link ext" href="http://faculty.clintoncc.suny.edu/faculty/michael.gregory/files/Bio%20101/Bio%20101%20Laboratory/Pedigree%20Analysis/PEDIGREE.HTM" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;Pedigree Analysis Web&lt;/a&gt; page. After reading and understanding the analysis of pedigrees, close the Mendelian Genetics window and return to this page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Inheritance of Recessive Traits&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This figure shows the pattern of inheritance that can be observed for a recessive trait. The half-filled symbols denote &lt;strong&gt;carriers&lt;/strong&gt; (heterozygotes). Note that an individual expressing a recessive trait (homozygous recessive) may not appear every generation, but carriers are still present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="lightbox lightbox-processed" assets/Tutorial6_Figure 1 Recessive pedigree.jpg" id="Figure 1. The pattern of inheritance for a recessive trait." rel="lightbox[][Figure 1. The pattern of inheritance for a recessive trait.]" title="Figure 1. The pattern of inheritance for a recessive trait."&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 1.

The pattern of inheritance for a recessive trait." /&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="lightbox lightbox-processed" assets/Tutorial6_Figure 2 Albinism.jpg" id="Figure 2. Pedigree for the recessive albinism trait" rel="lightbox[][Figure 2. Pedigree for the recessive albinism trait]" title="Figure 2. Pedigree for the recessive albinism trait"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 2.

Pedigree for the recessive albinism trait" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; This figure shows the pattern of inheritance for albinism, which typically shows a recessive mode of inheritance in humans. In this pedigree (as with most pedigree charts) heterozygotes are not marked, but you can infer their presence by the pattern of expression. Take a close look at this pedigree and locate the two cousins who marry and have children. Can you see why most societies have taboos regarding the marriage of first cousins?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Disease Inheritance&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="0" src="http://c.gigcount.com/wildfire/IMP/CXNID=2000002.0NXC/bT*xJmx*PTEzMDc*NjQ*NDM4NjImcHQ9MTMwNzQ2NDQ*NjE*MyZwPTIwNjQyMSZkPWIyMDk4MTczJmc9MiZvPTk2NjhhNGRlZDA4/NDRmNzlhYTY1ZTI4N2RlOTA2Y2E4Jm9mPTA=.gif" style="visibility: hidden; width: 0px; height: 0px;" width="0" /&gt;Next we will examine three diseases caused by deleterious recessive alleles: &lt;strong&gt;cystic fibrosis&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;phenylketonuria&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;sickle-cell&lt;/strong&gt; disease. Phenotypically normal parents must both be carriers (heterozygous) in order for the disease to be observed in their offspring. Remember, these are recessively inherited traits; an individual must inherit one allele from each carrier parent to exhibit the phenotype. Each time two carriers conceive a child, there is a 25% chance that the child will exhibit the phenotype, a 50% chance that the child will be a carrier, and a 25% chance that the child will be a non-carrier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Cystic Fibrosis&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cystic fibrosis (CF) is one of the most common genetic diseases that affects people of Caucasian ancestry. In a room of 20-30 such persons, approximately one is a carrier. The deleterious allele that causes this disease encodes for a protein that is involved in chloride ion transport; as a result, individuals with homozygous alleles for this gene have extreme problems with salt balance in cells (particularly those cells that line the lungs and intestines). This salt imbalance causes the mucous coating of certain cells to become unusually thick, causing affected individuals to have an extreme buildup of mucous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does a salt imbalance lead to thick mucous? The answer lies in understanding osmosis. Affected individuals accumulate salt in their epithelial cells (the cells that line body cavities). As a result, the cells become hypertonic (relative to outside the cell) and water is drawn into the cell. The mucous that lies outside the cell (which normally is relatively thin and watery) becomes thickened. This viscous mucous does not clear as efficiently as does normal mucous. This disease is pleiotropic, and a number of symptoms can result (e.g., lung infections, sterility in males).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is this deleterious allele so prevalent if it is so bad? Molecular evolutionary analyses of this allele indicate that it first appeared about 52,000 years ago (about the time when nearby eastern human populations were invading Europe to displace the Neanderthals). The prevalence of this gene in modern populations, along with its age, compels researchers to conclude that there must have been some selective advantage for the heterozygous state. What was this advantage? No one knows for sure. &lt;a class="external-link ext" href="http://bric.postech.ac.kr/science/97now/98_5now/980506b.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;Click here&lt;/a&gt; and read a short article entitled &quot;A Silver Lining for Cystic Fibrosis?&quot; that presents one possibility. When you return, consider what could be one reason Cystic Fibrosis may have persisted because of Heterozygotic Advantage?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Phenylketonuria&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phenylketonuria (PKU) is not as prevalent as cystic fibrosis. About 1 in 50 persons of Caucasian ancestry carry the defective allele. (1 in 64 persons of Asian ancestry have this allele; write this number down because you will need it to answer the next question.) The disease is only observed in individuals that are homozygous for the recessive allele, and the main symptom of PKU is mental retardation. The defective allele encodes for a nonfunctional phenylalanine hydrolase enzyme that normally converts the amino acid phenylalanine to the amino acid tyrosine. Those affected with PKU accumulate high levels of phenylalanine (and/or its metabolites), therefore, they have low levels of tyrosine. The high levels of phenylalanine metabolites affect neuronal development, which leads to mental retardation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Importantly, the symptoms associated with this disease can be prevented with proper nutrition. Phenylalanine is an amino acid found in many proteins; therefore, patients affected with PKU can escape the disease by strictly limiting themselves to low protein diets. Providing that PKU is detected early (most states require that all newborns be tested), proper nutrition will prevent the disease. There are doctors, lawyers, and teachers who are homozygous for PKU, yet they lead relatively normal lives (albeit with a life-long restricted diet).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PKU is a good example of not only a disease caused by a recessive allele, but also an example of a genetic state whereby the phenotype is strongly affected by the environment - with the proper diet, the phenotype is not expressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Sickle-Cell Anemia&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sickle-cell disease is one of the most common genetic diseases that affects persons of African ancestry. About 10% of such persons carry the allele for this trait. (In some areas of Africa, upwards of 40% carry the allele.) Individuals that carry homozygous alleles for sickle-cell disease suffer from a number of problems including anemia, pain, fever, and fatigue. The sickle-cell trait affects the hemoglobin molecule found in red blood cells, which is involved in oxygen transport. Left untreated, patients with sickle-cell disease typically die by the age of thirty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with cystic fibrosis, the prevalence of the allele in the population suggests that there is some benefit to carrying it in a heterozygous state. Indeed, this is the case. It is known that those individuals with heterozygous alleles are less susceptible to malaria than those with homozygous alleles. It is not surprising then that the highest frequency of this allele is found in areas where malaria is prevalent. This allele is probably the best example of natural selection in humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Inheritance of Dominant Traits&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;Example 1. Wooly hair results from a dominant allele; therefore, individuals that are homozygous dominant (WW) or heterozygous (Ww) have this trait. Individuals that are homozygous recessive (ww) for this gene have normal hair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="lightbox lightbox-processed" assets/Tutorial6_Figure 3. Wooly Hair.jpg" id="Figure 3. Pedigree of Wooly Hair" rel="lightbox[][Figure 3. Pedigree of Wooly Hair]" title="Figure 3. Pedigree of Wooly Hair"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 3. Pedigree of Wooly Hair" class="lightbox" src="assets/Tutorial6_Figure%203.%20Wooly%20Hair.jpg" style="width: 250px; height: 138px; margin: 10px;" title="Figure 3. Pedigree of Wooly Hair" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="lightbox lightbox-processed" assets/Tutorial6_Figure 4 Brachydactyly.jpg" id="Figure 4. Pedigree of Brachydactyly" rel="lightbox[][Figure 4. Pedigree of Brachydactyly]" title="Figure 4. Pedigree of Brachydactyly"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 4. Pedigree of Brachydactyly" class="lightbox" src="assets/Tutorial6_Figure%204%20Brachydactyly.jpg" style="margin: 10px; width: 442px; height: 329px;" title="Figure 4. Pedigree of Brachydactyly" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Example 2. Brachydactyly - a condition associated with shortness of fingers and toes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pedigree examples shown here best fit a dominant pattern of inheritance because:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The trait does not skip a generation.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Where one parent is affected, about half of the progeny are affected.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Sexes are about equally affected.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Huntington&amp;#39;s Chorea&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Huntingtons Disease&lt;/strong&gt; (HD) is a hereditary disease that causes progressive damage to the nervous system. It generally develops subtly in a person&amp;#39;s thirties or forties (though it can begin any time between childhood and old age). It is characterized by difficulties in three areas: uncontrollable movements, dementia, and psychiatric disturbances. Unlike the previous diseases described, which were caused by recessive alleles, HD is caused by a dominant allele. Most HD sufferers have one copy of the deleterious allele and one normal allele, so each child has a 50% chance of inheriting the disease. As you just read in the description of inheritance of dominant traits, HD does not skip generations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to note the late onset of this disease. This disease becomes noticeable after the normal child-bearing age. Also, consider that the life expectancy of men in America in the year 1900 was forty-six. Therefore, for much of modern human history (about 100,000-150,000 years) this disease probably was not prevalent because people died of other causes before HD symptoms appeared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Using Pedigrees&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="lightbox lightbox-processed" assets/Tutorial6_Figure%203.%20Wooly%20Hair2.jpg" id="Figure 5. Wooly Hair" rel="lightbox[][Figure 5. Wooly Hair]" title="Figure 5. Wooly Hair"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 5. Wooly Hair" class="lightbox" src="assets/Tutorial6_Figure%203.%20Wooly%20Hair.jpg" style="float: right; width: 250px; height: 138px; margin: 10px;" title="Figure 5. Wooly Hair" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Presented here is a pedigree for wooly hair.&lt;br class="atl-forced-newline" /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	The man at the top of the pedigree has normal hair, so his genotype is ww. His wife has wooly hair, but must be heterozygous (Ww) since three of their six children have normal hair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A pedigree not only allows a geneticist to understand the past, but it helps to predict the occurrence of a trait in future generations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a wooly hair grandson marries a normal hair woman and they plan on having three children, the probability that all three children will have wooly hair is &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;. Since the man is heterozygous (Ww) and the wife is homozygous (ww), each child has a &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; probability of inheriting the wooly hair allele (&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; X &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; X &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Summary&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pattern of phenotypic expression can be quite useful in determining the mode of transmission for a given characteristic. In fact, geneticists often study the expression of particular traits in family lineages, or pedigrees, in order to gain insight into the mode of expression for a given character trait. Not only can pedigree analyses provide insight into the mode of transmission, but importantly, they can be used to predict the genotype of particular individuals. This tutorial examined some human genetic diseases, including cystic fibrosis, PKU, and sickle-cell disease. These diseases are found in individuals that are homozygous for the gene, but as you learned, the heterozygous state has a well-documented advantage in the case of the sickle-cell disease and a probable advantage in the case of cystic fibrosis. Moreover, you learned that the phenotype can be affected by the environment; in the case of PKU, a person that is homozygous for the gene can escape the disease with a proper diet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not all genetic diseases that behave in a Mendelian fashion behave recessively. Huntington&amp;#39;s disease is a degenerative disease of the nervous system. Individuals with either homozygous or heterozygous genotypes develop this disease, ensuring that the defective allele is expressed in all generations as a dominant character trait. Individuals carrying this dominant allele do not begin to show symptoms until late in life (after their child-bearing years), and so, natural selection cannot act directly to affect the frequency of this allele in the population. In other words, through their reproductive years, individuals with this detrimental allele are just as fit (likely to reproduce) as normal individuals.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

&lt;h2&gt;Introduction and Goals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bacteria are everywhere. They have been found at the deepest depths of the oceans and high above in the atmosphere. Based on sheer numbers and species diversity, they are the most successful group of life on the planet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tutorial is the first in a three-part series discussing prokaryotes. By the end of this first tutorial you should have a basic understanding of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The basic features of all prokaryotes&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The diverse lifestyles of prokaryotes&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Why prokaryotes can undergo rapid evolutionary change&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The different nutritional modes of prokaryotes&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The basic genetic organization of prokaryotes&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Asexual reproduction as a means for acquiring new genetic information&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Basic Features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;A defining feature of &lt;strong&gt;prokaryotes&lt;/strong&gt; is their lack of membrane-bound nuclei. This is not to say they lack subcellular specialization because some prokaryotes have very elaborate internal membranes. However, they generally have less subcellular specialization than &lt;strong&gt;eukaryotes&lt;/strong&gt; (organisms with membrane-bound nuclei and organelles). Also, prokaryotes are usually much smaller than eukaryotic cells (1-5 microns compared to 10-100 microns). They are often described as single-celled organisms, but they can form colonies that show a remarkable level of complexity (as depicted in this colorized image of a bacterial colony). The shape of individual cells is used to classify prokaryotes; they can be either spherical (&lt;strong&gt;coccus&lt;/strong&gt;), rod-shaped (&lt;strong&gt;bacillus&lt;/strong&gt;), or helical (&lt;strong&gt;spirillum&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This animation is a simple game to test your understanding of the basic features of a prokaryote.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Classification&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last few decades, several taxonomic schemes have been used to describe life. One of the simplest divided life into prokaryotes and eukaryotes; that is, those organisms without nuclei went into one group and those with nuclei went into another, respectively. Another commonly used scheme divided life into five kingdoms: Monera (prokaryotes), Protista, Plantae, Fungi, and Animalia. Keep in mind that classification schemes strive to show the evolutionary relationships between groups, and in recent years it has become apparent that the evolutionary relationships of prokaryotes are quite complex. One prokaryotic group, the Archaea, have some features that are more eukaryotic than prokaryotic. Although the Archaea lack a nucleus, their genetic organization is more like that of a eukaryote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="lightbox lightbox-processed" assets/tutorial18_fig2_3_domain_system.jpg" id="Figure 2.  The Three-Domain System of Classification." rel="lightbox[][Figure 2.  The Three-Domain System of Classification.]" title="Figure 2.  The Three-Domain System of Classification."&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 2.  The Three-Domain System of Classification." class="lightbox" src="assets/tutorial18_fig2_3_domain_system.jpg" style="width: 350px; height: 200px; margin: 10px;" title="Figure 2.  The Three-Domain System of Classification." /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To reconcile new data, the taxonomic scheme of life has been revised. The most current scheme proposes that life be divided into three domains. In this scheme prokaryotic organisms can belong to the domain &lt;strong&gt;Archaea&lt;/strong&gt; or the domain &lt;strong&gt;Bacteria&lt;/strong&gt;, while those organisms that have a nucleus comprise the third domain, &lt;strong&gt;Eukarya&lt;/strong&gt;. Organisms that make up these three domains are sometimes referred to as archaebacteria, eubacteria and eukaryotes, respectively. This figure illustrates the relationship between the three domains. Keep in mind that the common ancestor of the prokaryotes most likely arose about 3 billion years ago.Archaea are sometimes referred to as &lt;strong&gt;extremophiles&lt;/strong&gt;, inhabiting extreme environments (e.g., hot springs, salt ponds, Arctic ice, deep oil wells, acidic ponds that form near mines, and hydrothermal vents); however, these environments are not extreme to the archaea. In fact, many extremophiles die when moved to our environment. Life is relative.&lt;/p&gt;

Pink, green, and brown-colored archaebacteria occupy the thermal gradients in the flowing water (60-100°C)." /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest of the prokaryotes are classified as bacteria. Some textbooks and articles still refer to all prokaryotes as bacteria, but there is an increasing tendency to make a distinction between archaebacteria and bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Limestone terraces, formed by precipitation from calcium-rich water flowing from a raised hotpool. Pink, green, and brown-colored archaebacteria occupy the thermal gradients in the flowing water (60-100&amp;deg;C).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Prokaryotes by the Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of metabolic impact and numbers, prokaryotes dominate the biosphere. They outnumber all eukaryotes combined. They live in a myriad of environments and even a teaspoon of common dirt can harbor 100 million or more bacteria. Not only are bacteria plentiful in total numbers, but the species diversity may be quite high as well. Although recognizing distinct species of bacteria is a challenge for microbiologists modern approaches using DNA diversity analysis, suggest that bacteria spawn new species quite rapidly. Recent studies suggest that in that same teaspoon of soil there could reside up to 1 million different species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fast Growth and High Rates of Evolution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some cases, prokaryotes can divide in as little as 20 minutes (although much slower rates are also observed). Generally, prokaryotes have three factors that enable them to grow rapidly. First, prokaryotes have a small genome (genetic material). Second, prokaryotes have simple morphologies (structural features). Third, prokaryotes replicate via &lt;strong&gt;binary fission&lt;/strong&gt;(cell division in which a prokaryotic chromosome replicates and the mother cell pinches in half to form two new daughter cells). These three factors allow for a short generation time. This short generation time means that evolutionary changes occur relatively quickly when compared to longer-lived species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Genetic Organization Aids Fast Generation Times&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared to eukaryotes, prokaryotes usually have much smaller genomes. On average, a eukaryotic cell has 1000 times more DNA than a prokaryote. This means that less DNA must be replicated with each division in prokaryotes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DNA in prokaryotes is concentrated in the &lt;strong&gt;nucleoid&lt;/strong&gt;. The prokaryotic chromosome is a double-stranded DNA molecule arranged as a single large ring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prokaryotes often have smaller rings of extrachromosomal DNA termed &lt;strong&gt;plasmids&lt;/strong&gt;. Most plasmids consist of only a few genes. Plasmids are not required for survival in most environments because the prokaryotic chromosome programs all of the cell&amp;#39;s essential functions. However, plasmids may contain genes that provide resistance to antibiotics, metabolism of unusual nutrients, and other special functions. Plasmids replicate independently of the main chromosome, and many can be readily transferred between prokaryotic cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="lightbox lightbox-processed" assets/tutorial18_fig4_bacterial_division.jpg" id="Figure 4.  Binary division in a bacterium." rel="lightbox[][Figure 4.  Binary division in a bacterium.]" title="Figure 4.  Binary division in a bacterium."&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 4.  Binary division in a bacterium." class="lightbox" src="assets/tutorial18_fig4_bacterial_division.jpg" style="width: 350px; height: 278px; margin: 10px;" title="Figure 4.  Binary division in a bacterium." /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Prokaryotes replicate via binary fission. Binary fission is simply cell division whereby two identical offspring each receive a copy of the original, single, parental chromosome. Binary fission is a type of asexual reproduction (reproduction that does not require the union of two reproductive cells, and that produces offspring genetically identical to the parent cell). A population of rapidly growing prokaryotes can synthesize their DNA almost continuously, which aids in their fast generation times. Even as a cell is physically separating, its DNA can be replicating for the next round of cell division.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Asexual Reproduction and the Transfer of Genetic Information Between Prokaryotes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prokaryotes do not alternate between the haploid and diploid states, hence meiosis and fertilization are not components of their life cycles. Rather, binary fission is the main method of reproduction in prokaryotes. This form of asexual reproduction means that the genetic variation afforded by meiosis/fertilization does not occur in prokaryotes. Nonetheless, genetic variation does occur in prokaryotes, and mutations (coupled with short generation times) are one source of variation in the population. Remember that genetic variation, within a population, can be beneficial because it provides the raw materials for a population to adapt to a changing environment. Greater diversity in the gene pool increases the likelihood that at least some of the organisms in a population will have the right alleles to survive if environmental conditions change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Transformation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One way that genetic material can be moved between bacteria is &lt;strong&gt;transformation&lt;/strong&gt;. Transformation occurs when prokaryotes acquire genes from their surrounding environment. This DNA might have been left behind by other bacteria (from the same or different species) when they died. The foreign DNA is directly taken up by the cell and expressed. If the DNA contains a beneficial gene (e.g., one encoding for antibiotic resistance), then the individuals harboring that gene will have a selective advantage over their non-transformed counterparts. As long as individuals with this gene reproduce more successfully, compared to those lacking the gene, they will be more fit and the gene will increase in frequency (i.e., microevolution, via natural selection, will occur).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other examples include transformation of nonpathogenic bacteria into &lt;strong&gt;pathogenic&lt;/strong&gt; (harmful) strains. When harmless &lt;em&gt;Streptococcus pneumoniae&lt;/em&gt; bacteria are placed in a medium containing dead cells of the pathogenic strain, they can take up the DNA from the dead pathogenic cells. If the formerly harmless bacteria pick up the gene for pathogenicity, they will become pathogenic themselves. It is important to point out that pathogenicity may not confer a long-term increase in fitness; if the host dies, the microsymbiont is left in a cold house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transformation is commonly used by genetic engineers to relocate bacterial genes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conjugation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genetic material can also be moved between bacteria by &lt;strong&gt;conjugation&lt;/strong&gt;. The mechanism of conjugation requires that two living prokaryotic cells physically join with one another. Typically DNA transfer only goes one way, with the &quot;male&quot; using an appendage called a &lt;strong&gt;pilus&lt;/strong&gt; (plural, pili). In order to produce pili, prokaryotes must have a plasmid termed the &lt;strong&gt;F factor&lt;/strong&gt;(fertility factor plasmid). When a cell has the F factor plasmid, it is said to be F+. This F+ condition is heritable. If an F+ cell divides, both of the resulting cells will be F+. This condition is also &quot;contagious.&quot; After an F+ cell conjugates with a &quot;female&quot; cell that does not contain the F factor, the &quot;female&quot; cell obtains the F factor plasmid and becomes F+ (&quot;male&quot;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Transduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;Genetic material can also be moved between bacteria by &lt;strong&gt;transduction&lt;/strong&gt;. In this event, the exchange of DNA between prokaryotes is made possible by &lt;strong&gt;phages&lt;/strong&gt;(viruses that infect bacteria). Phages reproduce by injecting their genetic material inside the bacterial cell, then multiplying, and eventually bursting from the cell. In a mechanism referred to as &lt;strong&gt;specialized transduction&lt;/strong&gt;, the phage DNA inserts somewhat benignly into the bacterial host chromosome. Here it can lay dormant for many generations. However, under certain conditions, the phage DNA excises itself from the bacterial chromosome (usually carrying pieces of the chromosome with it), then replicates and forms new phages that burst out of the cell. These phages can reinfect other bacteria and thereby transfer not only their own DNA, but pieces of the former host DNA into the newly infected bacterium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="lightbox lightbox-processed" assets/tutorial18_fig5_transduction.jpg" id="Figure 5. Overview of Transduction." rel="lightbox[][Figure 5. Overview of Transduction.]" title="Figure 5. Overview of Transduction."&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 5. Overview of Transduction." class="lightbox" src="assets/tutorial18_fig5_transduction.jpg" style="width: 350px; height: 274px; margin: 10px;" title="Figure 5. Overview of Transduction." /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Genetic Variation and Evolution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The short generation time associated with binary fission was pointed out earlier in this tutorial. We also know that mutations add new and different alleles to populations. These two factors (short generation times and mutations), combined with the processes of conjugation and transduction, help prokaryotic populations achieve vast genetic variation (without the alternation of haploid/diploid states seen in many eukaryotes). Generation times are minutes to hours, and can result in a beneficial mutation being heavily favored and passed on to a great number of offspring in a very short period of time. Once again, a short generation span enables prokaryotic populations to adapt very rapidly to environmental change. This adaptive evolution is as important now to prokaryotes as it was when prokaryotic life began to diversify a few billion years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Nutritional Modes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the course of evolution, prokaryotes have adapted to a myriad of environments. Part of this adaptation involves different ways of obtaining energy and carbon. In looking at the diversity of prokaryotes, one observes many different nutritional modes. When considering nutritional modes, there are some general features that are commonly used to categorize the nutritional state of any life form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="0" src="http://c.gigcount.com/wildfire/IMP/CXNID=2000002.0NXC/bT*xJmx*PTEzMDg5Mjc3NDcwMDEmcHQ9MTMwODkyNzc*OTQ5OSZwPTIwNjQyMSZkPWIyMTI4MTExJmc9MiZvPTk2NjhhNGRlZDA4/NDRmNzlhYTY1ZTI4N2RlOTA2Y2E4Jm9mPTA=.gif" style="visibility: hidden; width: 0px; height: 0px;" width="0" /&gt;All life can be categorized nutritionally, according to how an organism obtains its energy and from where it gets its carbon. The prefixes &quot;&lt;strong&gt;chemo&lt;/strong&gt;&quot; and &quot;&lt;strong&gt;photo&lt;/strong&gt;&quot; are used to describe whether the energy comes from a high-energy molecule (e.g., glucose) or from light, respectively. &quot;&lt;strong&gt;Auto&lt;/strong&gt;&quot; and &quot;&lt;strong&gt;hetero&lt;/strong&gt;&quot; are used to describe whether carbon dioxide or a more complex form of carbon is used as a carbon source, respectively. The prefixes are then affixed to the suffix &quot;&lt;strong&gt;troph&lt;/strong&gt;,&quot; meaning nourishment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tutorial introduced you to the prokaryotes. They are a very diverse group of organisms that are commonly referred to as bacteria; however, they are really comprised of two different domains. One domain, the Archaea, usually grow in the most extreme environments. Their ability to occupy extreme habitats is mirrored by their flexibility in utilizing resources; some species are photosynthetic, whereas others can live on oil or hydrogen sulfide. The other domain, the Bacteria, is much more abundant. Although diverse, members of both domains share some common features. Prokaryotes lack membrane-bound nuclei, they are generally single-celled or colonial, and they are very small. The genetic organization of prokaryotes and binary fission as a means for replication aids in their fast generation times, which contributes to relatively quick evolutionary changes. We will continue our discussion of prokaryotes in the next tutorial by exploring their morphologies and by describing some of their interactions with other life forms&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <title>Tutorial 5: The Complex Expression Patterns of Multiple Alleles</title>
    <body>&lt;h2&gt;Terms&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should have a working knowledge of the following terms:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table class="confluenceTable"&gt;
	&lt;tbody&gt;
		&lt;tr&gt;
			&lt;td class="confluenceTd"&gt;

				&lt;/ul&gt;
			&lt;/td&gt;
		&lt;/tr&gt;
	&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Introductions and Goals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mendel was able to carry out his work in an interpretable manner because he took careful notes, made accurate counts, and chose traits that exhibited a clear dominant or recessive expression pattern. In fact, alleles that show simple dominant or recessive expression patterns are sometimes called &quot;Mendelian traits.&quot; Few alleles, however, behave in such a simple Mendelian manner. This tutorial will explore more complex patterns of expression. By the end of this tutorial you should have a basic understanding of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Genes with multiple alleles&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The distinction between the three types of dominance&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;How genes can have multiple effects&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;How genes can affect the expression of other genes&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Why some characters are controlled by more than one gene&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Incomplete Dominance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="lightbox lightbox-processed" assets/Tutorial5_Figure 1 Incomplete Dominance.jpg" id="Figure 1. Incomplete Dominance" rel="lightbox[][Figure 1. Incomplete Dominance]" title="Figure 1. Incomplete Dominance"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 1. Incomplete Dominance" class="lightbox" src="assets/Tutorial5_Figure%201%20Incomplete%20Dominance.jpg" style="float: right; width: 415px; height: 450px; margin: 10px;" title="Figure 1. Incomplete Dominance" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Mendel&amp;#39;s experiments, offspring always looked like one of their two parents due to the &lt;strong&gt;complete dominance&lt;/strong&gt; of one allele over the other. This is not always the case because some genes display &lt;strong&gt;incomplete dominance&lt;/strong&gt;; that is, individuals with heterozygous alleles exhibit a phenotype intermediate between those with homozygous alleles. For example, this figure depicts the outcome of a cross between a snapdragon with red flowers and one with white flowers - the F&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; hybrids have pink flowers. In this case neither of the alleles for flower color are completely dominant over the other.&amp;nbsp; Therefore, individuals with heterozygous alleles have a phenotype unlike those with either set of homozygous alleles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As demonstrated in this figure, the Punnett square for this cross is like that for any other monohybrid cross. However, the ratio of phenotypes in the F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; generation is not 3:1 (dominant:recessive), as seen with completely dominant alleles, but rather a 1:2:1 ratio of red:pink:white flowers. In this example the alleles are symbolized differently than in the previous examples. Since neither allele dominates over the other, the use of an uppercase and lowercase version of the same letter is inappropriate. In this example the character (flower color) is indicated by a letter (&lt;em&gt;C&lt;/em&gt;), and the alleles encoding the trait (white, blue or red) are listed as uppercase subscripts (recall, they are both uppercase because neither is dominant to the other). You may see other symbolic representations for incomplete dominance, but don&amp;#39;t let this confuse you. The important thing to know is that some genes are expressed in an incomplete dominant manner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Codominance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="lightbox lightbox-processed" assets/Tutorial5_Figure 2 MN Blood Groups.jpg" id="Figure 2. MN Blood Groups" rel="lightbox[][Figure 2. MN Blood Groups]" title="Figure 2. MN Blood Groups"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 2. MN Blood Groups" class="lightbox" src="assets/Tutorial5_Figure%202%20MN%20Blood%20Groups.jpg" style="float: right; width: 412px; height: 298px; margin: 10px;" title="Figure 2. MN Blood Groups" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have examined complete dominance, in which one allele is clearly dominant over the other, and incomplete dominance, in which neither allele dominates over the other. In a third type of dominance, &lt;strong&gt;codominance&lt;/strong&gt;, both alleles are expressed in the phenotype of individuals that have heterozygous alleles. The human &lt;strong&gt;blood groups&lt;/strong&gt; designated M, N, and MN are examples of codominance. These groups are distinguished by the presence of two specific proteins on the surface of red blood cells, such as those shown in this figure. Group M individuals have one of the two proteins, group N have the other protein, and group MN have both proteins. In the latter case, the heterozygous situation does not result in an intermediate phenotype; instead, the M and N phenotypes are both expressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Three Types of Dominance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Distinguishing between the three types of dominance is sometimes difficult, however, a little review should help clarify things. Think of complete dominance, incomplete dominance, and codominance as a continuum. At one end is complete dominance, in which the phenotype for only one of the two alleles is expressed in individuals that are heterozygous for the alleles. At the other end is codominance, in which both alleles are equally expressed in individuals that are heterozygous for the alleles. In between there are various levels of incomplete dominance, in which individuals that are heterozygous for the alleles display an intermediate phenotype. The key to understanding the difference between the three types is to look at the phenotype of the individuals with heterozygous alleles, then classify the relationship accordingly.&lt;img border="0" height="0" src="http://c.gigcount.com/wildfire/IMP/CXNID=2000002.0NXC/bT*xJmx*PTEzMDcxNTg4NjI1MzMmcHQ9MTMwNzE1ODg2NTM3MiZwPTIwNjQyMSZkPWIyMDk*MDExJmc9MiZvPTk2NjhhNGRlZDA4/NDRmNzlhYTY1ZTI4N2RlOTA2Y2E4Jm9mPTA=.gif" style="visibility: hidden; width: 0px; height: 0px;" width="0" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Multiple Alleles&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far we have only examined traits controlled by two alleles. This is easy to visualize because diploid organisms can only possess two alleles. Within a population, however, more than two alleles can exist (although any given individual only has two alleles).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="lightbox lightbox-processed" assets/Tutorial5_Figure 3 AB Antigens.jpg" id="Figure 3. AB Antigens" rel="lightbox[][Figure 3. AB Antigens]" title="Figure 3. AB Antigens"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 3. AB Antigens" class="lightbox" src="assets/Tutorial5_Figure%203%20AB%20Antigens.jpg" style="float: left; width: 300px; height: 130px; margin: 10px;" title="Figure 3. AB Antigens" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	The human ABO blood groups are an example of &lt;strong&gt;multiple alleles&lt;/strong&gt;, and the relationship between phenotype and genotype is depicted in the figure above. There are four possible phenotypic blood types for this particular gene: A, B, AB, and O. The letters refer to two specific carbohydrate molecules on the surface of red blood cells. (Note, these are not the same molecules as the MN blood groups.) Individuals can have the A carbohydrate (blood type A), the B carbohydrate (blood type B), both the A and B carbohydrates (blood type AB), or neither carbohydrate (blood type O).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="lightbox lightbox-processed" assets/Tutorial5_Figure 4 ABO Blood Groups.jpg" id="Figure 4. ABO Blood Groups" rel="lightbox[][Figure 4. ABO Blood Groups]" title="Figure 4. ABO Blood Groups"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 4. ABO Blood Groups" class="lightbox" src="assets/Tutorial5_Figure%204%20ABO%20Blood%20Groups.jpg" style="float: left; width: 217px; height: 344px; margin: 10px;" title="Figure 4. ABO Blood Groups" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	The ABO blood groups are formed by various combinations of three different alleles; I&lt;sup&gt;A&lt;/sup&gt; (codes for carbohydrate A), I&lt;sup&gt;B&lt;/sup&gt; (codes for carbohydrate B), and &lt;em&gt;i&lt;/em&gt; (codes for the lack of any carbohydrate). As shown in this figure, individuals with one or two I&lt;sup&gt;A&lt;/sup&gt; alleles will have blood type A, those with one or two I&lt;sup&gt;B&lt;/sup&gt; alleles will have blood type B, those with both the I&lt;sup&gt;A&lt;/sup&gt; and I&lt;sup&gt;B&lt;/sup&gt; alleles will have blood type AB, and those with the genotype &lt;em&gt;ii&lt;/em&gt; will have blood type O.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Punnett square can be used to predict the genotype frequencies resulting from multiple allele crosses. However, one cannot be certain of an individual&amp;#39;s genotype if they are blood type A or B because there are two possible genotypes for each of these blood types. Therefore, many cross problems that examine blood types are similar to test crosses; that is, the parental genotype is uncertain. A few examples will aid in your understanding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Pleiotropy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="lightbox lightbox-processed" assets/Tutorial5_Figure 5 Pleiotropy Albinism.jpg" id="Figure 5. Pleiotropy Albinism" rel="lightbox[][Figure 5. Pleiotropy Albinism]" title="Figure 5. Pleiotropy Albinism"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 5. Pleiotropy Albinism" class="lightbox" src="assets/Tutorial5_Figure%205%20Pleiotropy%20Albinism.jpg" style="float: right; width: 416px; height: 303px; margin: 10px;" title="Figure 5. Pleiotropy Albinism" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	So far we have only considered genes that affect a single phenotypic character. This actually is a rare situation because it is more common that one gene can have multiple effects (&lt;strong&gt;pleiotropy&lt;/strong&gt;). For example, albino individuals lack pigment in their skin and hair, and also have crossed eyes at a higher frequency than pigmented individuals (&lt;em&gt;see photograph&lt;/em&gt;). This occurs because the gene that causes albinism can also cause defects in the nerve connections between the eyes and the brain. These two traits are not always linked, again showing the complexity of genetic interactions in determining phenotypes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mendel also recognized this effect. He observed that pea plants with red flowers had red coloration where the leaf joined the stem, but that their seed coats were gray in color. Plants with white flowers had no coloration at the leaf-stem juncture and displayed white seed coats. These combinations were always found together, leading Mendel to conclude that they were likely controlled by the same hereditary unit (i.e., gene).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Epistasis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="lightbox lightbox-processed" assets/Tutorial5_Figure 6 Epistasis.jpg" id="Figure 6. Epistasis" rel="lightbox[][Figure 6. Epistasis]" title="Figure 6. Epistasis"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 6. Epistasis" class="lightbox" src="assets/Tutorial5_Figure%206%20Epistasis.jpg" style="float: right; width: 385px; height: 445px; margin: 10px;" title="Figure 6. Epistasis" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Sometimes a gene at one location on a chromosome can affect the expression of a gene at a second location (&lt;strong&gt;epistasis&lt;/strong&gt;). A good example of epistasis is the genetic interactions that produce coat color in horses and other mammals. In horses, brown coat color (&lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt;) is dominant over tan (&lt;em&gt;b&lt;/em&gt;). Gene expression is dependent on a second gene that controls the deposition of pigment in hair. The dominant gene (&lt;em&gt;C&lt;/em&gt;) codes for the presence of pigment in hair, whereas the recessive gene (&lt;em&gt;c&lt;/em&gt;) codes for the absence of pigment. If a horse is homozygous recessive for the second gene (&lt;em&gt;cc&lt;/em&gt;), it will have a white coat regardless of the genetically programmed coat color (B gene) because pigment is not deposited in the hair. The figure above demonstrates this scenario. Several of the white horses have genotypes for brown or tan coat color in the first gene, but are completely white because they are homozygous recessive for the gene controlling pigment deposition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Polygenic Inheritance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The characters that Mendel studied are sometimes referred to as discrete characters because they can only be classified on an &quot;either-or&quot; basis (e.g., purple or white flowers, green or yellow seeds). Many characters cannot be classified in this manner because they vary in a population across a continuum (gradient). For example, the figure above illustrates that skin color in humans is a &lt;strong&gt;quantitative character&lt;/strong&gt;. Quantitative characters usually indicate that the character is controlled by more than one gene (&lt;strong&gt;polygenic inheritance&lt;/strong&gt;). &lt;a class="lightbox lightbox-processed" assets/Tutorial5_Figure 7 Polygenic Inheritance.jpg" id="Figure 7. Polygenic Inheritance" rel="lightbox[][Figure 7. Polygenic Inheritance]" title="Figure 7. Polygenic Inheritance"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 7. Polygenic Inheritance " class="lightbox" src="assets/Tutorial5_Figure%207%20Polygenic%20Inheritance.jpg" style="float: left; width: 360px; height: 450px; margin: 10px;" title="Figure 7. Polygenic Inheritance" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;In the example shown, a simplification of the genetics of skin color in humans shows that three genes interact to determine the level of pigment in an individual&amp;#39;s skin. The dominant alleles (&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;C&lt;/em&gt;) each contribute one &quot;unit&quot; of pigment to the individual, and their effects are cumulative such that individuals with more of these alleles will be darker than those with fewer alleles. The recessive alleles (&lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;b&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;c&lt;/em&gt;) do not contribute any units of pigment. Therefore, skin color is related to the number of dominant alleles present in each individual&amp;#39;s genotype. A cross of two completely heterozygous parents produces seven phenotypes in their offspring, ranging from very light to very dark skin. The distribution of skin color in the offspring would resemble a bell-shaped curve because there would be more individuals with intermediate skin colors than either extreme. As the number of genes involved increases, the differences between the various genotypes become more subtle and the distribution fits the curve more closely. Other examples of polygenic inheritance in humans include height, hair color, and eye color. This helps to explain the slight variations in these characters that we see in different individuals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Summary&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tutorial explored the more complex expression patterns of alleles. These patterns of expression do not contradict the ideas and conclusions of Mendel, rather they reveal that genes and their products can interact and/or be expressed in complex ways. In all cases, these genes are still transmitted from generation to generation on chromosomes that segregate independently during meiosis. The differences lie in how the gene product behaves within the cell, and the number of such products that contribute to a given character trait.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some alleles can show incomplete dominance. In the snapdragon flower color and snake body color examples, we saw that three phenotypes could be traced to two alleles. In other words, two separate homozygous phenotypes resulted (as is usually seen with characters transmitted in a Mendelian manner) and a third phenotype associated with a heterozygous genotype (clearly different than the case observed with Mendelian traits, where the heterozygous phenotype is the same as the homozygous dominant genotype). How can two alleles yield three phenotypes? Consider the snapdragon. When a plant receives two alleles (a double dose) of the red allele, the flower is very red. These alleles encode for enzymes involved in the production of red pigment. The alternative alleles produce an enzyme that is nonfunctional and cannot participate in pigment synthesis. When a plant receives two copies of this nonfunctional alternative allele, pigment is not produced and the flower is white. When the plant receives one copy (a single dose) of the functional red allele, it can produce some pigment, but not as much as with two fully functional alleles, and so, the color is less red (pink).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the example above, note that the reason for the phenotypic pattern was that one allele was nonfunctional and the other functional allele resulted in a phenotype that was dependent on there being one or two copies of the functional alleles. There is another situation, however, termed codominance, in which both alleles are functional and expressed. The M and N blood groups are examples of codominance. These alleles encode for proteins that are located on the surface of red blood cells. They are similar but nonidentical; that is, they differ in four amino acids. If the individual is homozygous, then the phenotype is either M or N. If heterozygous, however, then both are expressed on the surface of red blood cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far we have considered fairly simple cases, where the number of alleles is limited to two. In fact, many genes have multiple alleles. This may seem impossible because in the diploid state there is only room for two alleles (one on the maternal chromosome and one on the paternal chromosome) of a gene. At the population level, however, many more allele forms are possible (although in any given diploid individual, only two occur at any given time). The ABO blood type is one example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some cases, genes and their alleles may be expressed in complex ways. That is, no single trait can be attributed to a given allele. Pleiotropy describes this situation, and includes the examples of pigmentation and crossed eyes in the case of albinism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case where one gene product is used by (or dependent on) another product, epistasis can occur. This is fairly common because gene products do not function in isolation. In the example of fur color in mice, one can see that pigment synthesis and pigment deposition are two processes that must occur in order for a specific phenotype (i.e., color) to be observed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, we considered the case of polygenic inheritance, whereby many genes and their alleles are involved in the expression of a given phenotype. If you think about it, you will likely recognize that polygenic inheritance and epistasis are related. In fact, many traits are determined by multiple genes, which makes the analysis of expression patterns complex.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

	&lt;tbody&gt;
		&lt;tr&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Introduction and Goals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tutorial emphasizes the work of Gregor Mendel, the father of modern genetics. Mendel was the first scientist to examine, in a quantitative manner, the behavior of traits between generations. By looking at the proportions of progeny, he was able to infer the basic tenets of modern genetics. By the conclusion of this tutorial you should have a basic understanding of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Mendel and modern genetics&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The distinction between characters and traits&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Meiosis and the segregation of alleles&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The molecular relationship between genotype and phenotype&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The laws of segregation and independent assortment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Modern Genetics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/courses/biol110/sites/edu.courses.biol110/files/images/Tutorial3_Figure1Mendel.jpg" onclick="return hs.expand(this)" style="float: right; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px;" title="Figure. Johann Gregor Mendel"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="lightbox" src="/courses/biol110/sites/edu.courses.biol110/files/images/Tutorial3_Figure1Mendel.jpg" style="width: 136px; height: 179px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Johann Gregor Mendel was born in 1822 and was raised on his parents small farm, in what is now the Czech Republic. After attending high school and the Olmutz Philosophical Institute, Mendel became a friar at an Augustinian monastery in Brno in 1843 at the age of 21. After several years of theological study, Mendel failed his teacher&amp;#39;s examination and was sent to the University of Vienna (Austria) for two years of study from 1851-1853.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He returned to the monastery and began his studies of inheritance with pea plants (&lt;em&gt;Pisum&lt;/em&gt;) grown in the monastery&amp;#39;s garden. He published his work in 1865; however, it went largely unnoticed until its rediscovery in 1900, sixteen years after his death. Mendel&amp;#39;s experiments demonstrated many of the basic principles of genetics, and so, his studies are used to illustrate the first principles of inheritance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Characters (Genes) and Traits (Alleles)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mendel probably chose to work with pea plants because of the many variants that exist in their &lt;strong&gt;morphology&lt;/strong&gt; (physical appearance). The color of the flowers, seeds, and pods can differ between individuals, as well as the position of the flower on the stem, the length of the stem, and the shape of the seeds and pods. &lt;em&gt;Pisum&lt;/em&gt; provided Mendel with a wide variety of characteristics with which to examine patterns of inheritance. At this point, we need to introduce the terms that Mendel referred to as a character and a trait.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mendel defined a character as a heritable feature for which variants exist, and a trait as a particular variant for the character. For example, flower color is a character, whereas purple and white are traits. Today, we use the term &quot;gene&quot; to refer to a character and &quot;allele&quot; to refer to a trait.&amp;nbsp; For example, in pea plants there is a gene for flower color and the two alleles are purple and white. Other characters (and traits) that he studied included: seed color (yellow or green); seed shape (round or wrinkled); pod shape (inflated or restricted); flower position (terminal or axial); and plant height (tall or dwarf).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;object align="left" data="https://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2092519" height="480" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="600"&gt;&lt;param name="quality" value="high" /&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="https://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2092519" /&gt;&lt;param name="wmode" value="transparent" /&gt;&lt;embed align="bottom" height="480" hspace="10" quality="high" src="https://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2092519" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" vspace="10" width="600" wmode="transparent"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;The Molecular Relationship Between Genotype and Phenotype&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This figure illustrates the relationship between genotypes and phenotypes, with flower color used as an example. An organism&amp;#39;s &lt;strong&gt;genotype&lt;/strong&gt; is its genetic makeup for a particular trait; that is, a listing of its alleles at a given location. The &lt;strong&gt;phenotype&lt;/strong&gt; is the organism&amp;#39;s appearance; that is, the trait produced by the alleles at the location for that trait. How does the genotype for a trait lead to the phenotype? The different alleles at a given location differ in their DNA sequences, thereby producing different enzymes when transcribed into RNA. These enzymes can have different levels of activity; therefore, the organism&amp;#39;s phenotype will differ depending on the enzymes present. The manner in which gene products interact to determine the phenotype is usually complex. The example provided below should help to clarify the relationship between genotype and phenotype.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In peas, the character &quot;flower color&quot; has two traits: the dominant purple flower and the recessive white flower.&amp;nbsp; The &lt;strong&gt;dominant allele&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; codes for a functional enzyme that creates a pigment that makes the flower purple. The &lt;strong&gt;recessive allele&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;, however, has a defect in its DNA sequence and results in a nonfunctional enzyme - no pigment is produced and the flower appears white. .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In individuals with two copies of the recessive allele (&lt;em&gt;pp&lt;/em&gt;), have white flowers because both copies of their allele code for nonfunctional pigment-producing enzyme.&amp;nbsp; An individual that is &lt;em&gt;PP&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Pp&lt;/em&gt;, on the other hand, has at least one functional version of the pigment-producing allele and thus has purple flowers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mendel&amp;#39;s Technique for Crossing Peas&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a assets/Tutorial3_Figure2GeneticCross.jpg" onclick="return hs.expand(this)" style="float: right; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px;" title="Figure 2. A Genetic Cross"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 2. Genetic Cross" class="lightbox" src="assets/Tutorial3_Figure2GeneticCross.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 335px; margin: 10px; float: right;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;In addition to Pisum&amp;#39;s variety of characters and traits with which to study patterns of inheritance, Mendel also probably chose to study peas because their reproduction can be easily controlled, which afforded him strict control over the mating of different individuals. The general process is shown in this figure. Peas will often &lt;strong&gt;self-fertilize&lt;/strong&gt; (also termed &quot;selfing&quot;), transferring pollen from the stamens to the carpel on the same flower. The ease by which peas can be &quot;selfed&quot; played an important role in Mendel&amp;#39;s studies. In some cases, Mendel wanted to cross plants with different traits. This required that he prevent selfing by removing the immature stamens before they produced pollen; he then brushed the carpel with pollen from another individual. This enabled him to control the fertilization process, and therefore the parentage of each individual. The pollinated carpel matured into a pod, and the seeds within the pod were planted to give rise to a new generation of adult plants. The mature plants (produced by the seeds) were then examined for traits, and the process repeated again as desired. This manipulation made it possible for Mendel to keep track of the parents of each individual, and to examine how traits were transmitted through generations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mendel&amp;#39;s Crosses&lt;/h2&gt;

Genetic Crosses"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 3. Genetic Crosses F3" class="lightbox" src="assets/Tutorial%203%20Figure%203%20Genetic%20Crosses%20F3.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 351px; margin: 10px; float: left;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Mendel tracked heritable characters for three generations. In the first generation, the &lt;strong&gt;P generation&lt;/strong&gt; (parental generation), Mendel crossed two &quot;&lt;strong&gt;true-breeding&lt;/strong&gt;&quot; parents with differing traits for one or more characters. &quot;True-breeding&quot; means that all of the offspring of that individual have the same trait as the parent when the offspring are produced by self-pollination. In this figure, the individual with white flowers was true-breeding because all of the offspring produced from a self-pollination had white flowers. Similarly, the individual with purple flowers only produced offspring with purple flowers when self-pollinated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The crossing of two true-breeding parents produced an &lt;strong&gt;F&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;generation&lt;/strong&gt; of hybrid individuals that exhibited only the trait found in one of the two parents. The trait that was expressed in the F&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; generation was termed a &lt;strong&gt;dominant trait&lt;/strong&gt;. The F&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; generation hybrids were then each self-pollinated, producing an &lt;strong&gt;F&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;generation&lt;/strong&gt;. Although not present in the F&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; generation, the trait exhibited by the one parent reappeared in this generation, invariably at approximately a 3:1 ratio of one parental trait to the other. The trait that reappeared in the F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; generation was termed a &lt;strong&gt;recessive trait&lt;/strong&gt; because it receded in the previous generation. Mendel counted large numbers (hundreds to thousands) of offspring in the F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; generation, allowing him to analyze his results mathematically; from which he determined the mode and manner of inheritance in this species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ratios&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key to understanding Mendelian genetics is to understand what ratios are and how to determine them. Let&amp;#39;s do a few exercises to insure that you are familiar with ratios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 style="text-align: justify;"&gt;Ratio order&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In ratios, order means everything. In the example shown above, the F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; generation had a 3:1 ratio of individuals with purple to white flowers. The same results could be written as a 1:3 ratio of white to purple flowers. Therefore, the order of the traits listed within the ratio are important because the first number in the ratio is related to the first trait listed and the second number in the ratio corresponds to the second trait.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 style="text-align: justify;"&gt;Converting counts to ratios&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of Mendel&amp;#39;s actual data are listed below. Note that the ratios are obtained by dividing the larger of the two counts by the smaller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
	&lt;tbody&gt;
		&lt;tr&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;Flower color&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
				Purple = 705 individuals&lt;br /&gt;
				White = 224 individuals&lt;b&gt; 705/224 = 3.15&lt;br /&gt;
				Ratio of purple:white&lt;br /&gt;
				flowers is 3.15:1&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pod shape&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
				Inflated = 882 individuals&lt;br /&gt;
				Constricted = 299 individuals&lt;br /&gt;
				882/299 = 2.95&lt;br /&gt;
				Ratio of inflated:constricted&lt;br /&gt;
				pods is 2.95:1&lt;/td&gt;
		&lt;/tr&gt;
	&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An examination of the ratios listed above shows that they are all approximately a 3:1 ratio, some being slightly higher and others slightly lower. The inheritance of traits is governed in some respects by probability (as you will learn in upcoming exercises), therefore, it is sometimes advisable to round off ratios to the nearest whole number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The relationship between ratios and fractions can be confusing. A ratio of 1:3 means that there are four &quot;units&quot; being considered. In other words, 1:3 does not mean 33% have one trait, while 66% have the other. Rather, 1:3 means that 25% (1 unit) have one trait and 75% (3 units) have the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Estimating Offspring Counts from Ratios&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;object align="right" classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0" data="https://online.science.psu.edu/sites/default/files/biol110/Tutorial3_MendelsCross.swf" height="480" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="640"&gt;&lt;param name="quality" value="high" /&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="https://online.science.psu.edu/sites/default/files/biol110/Tutorial3_MendelsCross.swf" /&gt;&lt;embed height="480" hspace="10" pluginspage="http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer" quality="high" src="assets/Tutorial3_MendelsCross.swf" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" vspace="10" width="640"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as you can calculate ratios from counts of offspring, you can also work backwards and estimate offspring counts from ratios. Let&amp;#39;s do an example to demonstrate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You cross two true-breeding parents, one with purple flowers and one with white flowers, grow and self-pollinate the F&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; generation, and then count the number of offspring with purple and white flowers. If you counted 1,000 offspring and there was a 3:1 ratio of purple:white flowers, how many offspring would have purple flowers? How many would have white flowers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pull out a piece of paper and pencil (and/or your calculator) to see if you can get the right answer before viewing the solution below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ratio Problem Solution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = total number of offspring = 1,000&lt;br /&gt;
	3:1 ratio = total of 4 &quot;units&quot; (3 + 1 = 4)&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; of units have purple flowers, &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; have white flowers (Recall, there was a 3:1 ratio of purple:white flowers.)&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; = 75%, &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; = 25%&lt;br /&gt;
	75% purple flowers, 25% white flowers&lt;br /&gt;
	Convert to decimal equivalent: 0.75 purple flowers, 0.25 white flowers&lt;br /&gt;
	Numbers = &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; X 0.75 for purple, &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; X 0.25 for white&lt;br /&gt;
	purple = 1,000 X 0.75 = 750, white = 1,000 X 0.25 = 250&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Estimate = 750 offspring with purple flowers, 250 with white flowers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mendel and the First Principles of Genetics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mendel was not the first person to study how features were passed between generations, however, he was the first to take a careful and quantitative look at the situation. In doing so, he made a number of inferences that continue to have a profound influence on how we think about the transmission of information between generations. He didn&amp;#39;t know about DNA, genes, or chromosomes, but his insightful studies laid the groundwork for their discovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mendel quantitatively analyzed how specific traits behaved between generations and concluded that all offspring have two factors for a given character: one was received from the father and one was received from the mother. For a given character (e.g., flower color), one trait was always expressed (i.e., purple was dominant), whereas the other trait might recede between generations (i.e., white was recessive). In other words, recessive traits are only expressed if the two factors are the same (in the &lt;strong&gt;homozygous&lt;/strong&gt; state), whereas a dominant trait will be expressed even if only one factor is present (in the &lt;strong&gt;heterozygous&lt;/strong&gt; state).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;object align="left" data="https://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2092734" height="480" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="640"&gt;&lt;param name="quality" value="high" /&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="https://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2092734" /&gt;&lt;param name="wmode" value="transparent" /&gt;&lt;embed height="480" hspace="10" quality="high" src="https://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2092734" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" vspace="10" width="640" wmode="transparent"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mendel proposed that the discrete units for a given character would segregate away from one another during gamete production (e.g., individuals that were heterozygous with purple flowers could produce gametes with either a white or purple factor, but not both). This is often referred to as the Law of Segregation. Mendel looked at seven different characters and found that each character behaved independent of the other. He concluded that the factors associated with different characters assorted independently (in a random fashion) from one another. This is often referred to as the Law of Independent Assortment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has been almost 150 years since Mendel made his observations and inferences. In the years since, geneticists have validated his basic conclusions and we now know they describe the first principles of genetics. While we now refer to &quot;factors&quot; as genes, Mendel was the first to predict their presence and behavior between generations. His basic conclusions are as correct today as they were when he first proposed them, and his work spurred the work of thousands of geneticists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 style="text-align: justify;"&gt;Modern Mendelian Genetics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traits with simple dominant/recessive expression patterns, such as those examined in the previous exercise, are called &lt;strong&gt;Mendelian traits&lt;/strong&gt;. Mendelian traits are found in humans, and include attached versus unattached earlobes, mid-digital hair, bent thumbs, and a few other traits. These traits are useful for understanding the basic principles of genetics, but as you will learn in other genetics tutorials, very few traits are actually inherited in this simple manner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Summary&lt;object align="right" data="https://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2092846" height="480" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="640"&gt;&lt;param name="quality" value="high" /&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="https://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2092846" /&gt;&lt;param name="wmode" value="transparent" /&gt;&lt;embed height="480" hspace="10" quality="high" src="https://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2092846" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" vspace="10" width="640" wmode="transparent"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mankind has been aware of life cycles for thousands of years. Over the millennia, plant breeders have used variations in crop plants to select for improved varieties without really understanding the basic first principles of genetics. They simply crossed individuals that had the most favorable traits. The science of modern genetics is rooted in the work of Gregor Mendel, who was the first to carefully document the behavior of traits between successive generations. Mendel did not know about chromosomes, yet his observations predicted their presence. His careful analyses of monohybrid crosses allowed him to deduce that traits may skip a generation, depending on whether or not they are recessive (i.e., heterozygous recessive alleles are not expressed). In other words, he was able to infer the genetic composition (the genotype) by carefully observing the pattern of the observed character traits (the phenotypes) between successive generations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We now know that the reason for the particular pattern of phenotypic expression in the F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; generation is because of the behavior of chromosomes during meiosis in the F&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; generation. Be sure that you understand how the segregation of chromosomes in meiosis provides a mechanism to account for the segregation frequencies observed in the F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind, Mendel did his work around the time of the American Civil War.&amp;nbsp; For a vivid historical perspective, imagine Mendel tending his garden in Brno (now in the Czech Republic), while across the Atlantic the armies of the North and South were engaged in a very different activity. Since the work of Mendel, we have learned a good deal about genetics. Not only do we understand why Mendel observed the frequencies that he did in the different generations, the molecular events that relate the genotype directly to the phenotype are also understood.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

&lt;p style="text-align: ;"&gt;&lt;a class="ext" href="http://bio.psu.edu/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Department of Biology&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Instructor:&lt;/strong&gt; Denise Woodward&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Office Hours:&lt;/strong&gt; You may email me through ANGEL. &lt;strong&gt;Required Textbooks:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mastering Biology Access&lt;/strong&gt;:&amp;nbsp; Instructions for registering for Mastering Biology are on ANGEL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Optional Textbook:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp; Reece, J et al. 2011. Campbell Biology.&amp;nbsp; Ninth Edition.&amp;nbsp; Pearson Benjamin Cummings, San Francisco, CA.&amp;nbsp; The prior edition can also be used.&amp;nbsp; The textbook is not required but some students have found it to be a valuable supplement to the online tutorials to the course so page numbers have been provided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Course Prerequisites:&lt;/strong&gt; None.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technical Requirements:&lt;/strong&gt; This course is delivered entirely online; see the &lt;strong&gt;Technical Requirements&lt;/strong&gt; section below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Course Description&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of this course is to introduce you to fundamental concepts that are common to all organisms and to explore the biological diversity of life on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Tentative Schedule&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be weekly online quizzes and homework assignments. The syllabus is posted on ANGEL.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Course Requirements&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most important requirements is that students are responsible for reading and understanding all information regarding the conduct of the course. Read the important introductory documents, found under the lessons tab, first to reduce confusion later on.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inevitably someone will email asking for information that will be easily found in these documents. You will simply be directed to read them again, (and it&amp;#39;s not permitted to be annoyed by this). It just makes sense to read the information right at the beginning of the course and refer to it later on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Course Prerequisites&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are no prerequisites for this course.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <title>Academic Integrity</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;Instructors are asked (&lt;a class="ext" href="http://www.psu.edu/ufs/policies/47-00.html#49-20" target="_blank"&gt;Senate Rule 49-20&lt;/a&gt;) to provide at the beginning of a course a statement to clarify the application of academic integrity criteria to that course. The Senate Rule includes the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Integrity is the pursuit of scholarly activity in an open, honest and responsible manner. Academic integrity is a basic guiding principle for all academic activity at The Pennsylvania State University, and all members of the University community are expected to act in accordance with this principle. Consistent with this expectation, the &lt;a class="ext" href="http://studentaffairs.psu.edu/judicial/codeofconduct/" target="_blank"&gt;University&amp;#39;s Code of Conduct&lt;/a&gt; states that all students should act with personal integrity, respect other students&amp;#39; dignity, rights and property, and help create and maintain an environment in which all can succeed through the fruits of their efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Academic integrity includes a commitment by all members of the University community not to engage in or tolerate acts of falsification, misrepresentation or deception. Such acts of dishonesty violate the fundamental ethical principles of the University community and compromise the worth of work completed by others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All &lt;a class="ext" href="http://www.psu.edu/dept/oue/aappm/G-9.html" target="_blank"&gt;Penn State&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="ext" href="http://www.science.psu.edu/academic/Integrity/Policy.html" target="_blank"&gt;Eberly College of Science&lt;/a&gt; academic Integrity polices and procedures regarding ethics and honorable behavior apply to this course. Academic dishonesty includes, but is not limited to, cheating, plagiarizing, fabrication of information or citations, facilitating acts of academic dishonesty by others, having unauthorized possession of examinations or other unauthorized class materials, submitting work of another person or work previously used without informing the instructor, or tampering with the academic work of other students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Specific instances of academic dishonesty in this course include, but are not limited to:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;representing yourself to be another person online&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;allowing another person to represent yourself online&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;allowing unauthorized persons to access lecture materials, quizzes, or exams&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;copying or helping someone else copy during an examination&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;receiving help or information from any person during a quiz or exam&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;using unauthorized materials or notes during quizzes or examinations&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;searching for answers on the internet (&quot;googling&quot; for answers)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;using a programmable calculator on quizzes or examinations&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;use of a cell phone or other communication device during a quiz or exam&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;stealing or destroying course materials&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;sharing information about quiz and exam questions with other students&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;altering answers or grades on graded examinations&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;having someone take an examination for you&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;distributing course materials to others&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;attempting to do any of the above&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consequences of such infractions may range from awarding a grade of &amp;ldquo;0&amp;rdquo; on the exam or assignment in question to receiving an immediate F in the course &lt;strong&gt;(and not allowing the student to drop the class).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <title>Integrity Lesson</title>
    <body>&lt;h2 class="art-postheader"&gt;Academic Integrity, Plagiarism, and Copyright&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
	&lt;h4&gt;PLEASE NOTE:&lt;/h4&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;This instructional module is not and should not be considered legal advice. If you are having a problem with an academic integrity issue, copyright issue, or plagiarism issue, you should consult the the appropriate administrative or legal authorities immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A. Purpose&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Academic integrity affects everyone at Penn State, whether you are a student, a professor, an instructor, or a staff member. It is everyone&amp;#39;s responsibility to know what the Penn State policy on Academic Integrity says. Every member of the Penn State community is also expected to understand what plagiarism is as well as current copyright laws and how they apply to each person&amp;#39;s work. This module provides an introduction to academic integrity, plagiarism, and copyright, and additional resources for obtaining more information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;B. Goals and Objectives&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jennifer really enjoys the art history class she is taking this semester. She spends a lot of time on her final project&amp;mdash;a portfolio of works of art that she selects, writes a brief background about the artist, and then describes what she feels about the piece. She is careful to make sure that all of the information about the artists is correct, and reads several essays on the artists she has chosen. She agrees with most of what the essayists have to say regarding the pieces. She represents some of their thoughts in her project as her own, reasoning that since it is not fact, and instead intangible opinion, and because she agrees with them, then she is not plagiarizing. (&lt;em&gt;Used with permission from &amp;nbsp;&amp;copy; Regents of the University of Minnesota, 2001&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Is Jennifer right or wrong? Why?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you ever done something, like Jennifer, that seemed like it should be OK to do, but that you weren&amp;#39;t really sure about? The activities and information in this module will help you avoid academic dishonesty by helping you understand what you can and cannot do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;By the time you finish this module, you will be able to:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Define academic integrity&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Identify instances of cheating and plagiarism&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;List five reasons why plagiarism is wrong&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Understand the consequences of committing an act of academic dishonesty at Penn State&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Identify situations where &quot;fair use&quot; applies to the use of someone else&amp;#39;s materials&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Identify works in the Public Domain&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Find information about the correct way to cite a reference&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Begin to develop your personal philosophy on academic integrity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;C. Planning Your Learning&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because the topic of academic integrity is so complex, the information in this module has been divided in to several sections. The recommended sequence is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Read the information about academic integrity and complete the activity.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Read about plagiarism and cheating and complete the activity.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Read about copyright and fair use and complete the activity.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Read about excuses students make and how you can avoid situations that lead to academic dishonesty and the penalties that will be imposed in cases where academic dishonesty is proven.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Finally, take a few minutes to think about your personal philosophy on academic integrity. Read each of these scenarios and think about the situation. Is what the students are doing wrong or right, why is it wrong or right, how would you handle the situation, and what you would say to them if they were your friends? Then read the commentary for each scenario to see what others have said about the same situation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;D. References&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Case Study #1:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David is a senior and only has three more classes this semester before he graduates. He feels the pressure to uphold his 3.65 GPA, as well as just wanting to finish and get the classes out of the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In one of his classes, an extra credit assignment is to read through a set of given texts from certain articles and books that have been given by the instructor throughout the semester, and then to compile personal thoughts based on the principles covered. To David, it seemed like basically doing something he already had done in the class&amp;mdash;read the same information again. He figured the instructor just wanted to make sure the students really did read the articles, so David wrote his paper using direct quotes and verbatim phrases from the reading without correct citation. It was just extra credit, after all, so if it was not as good as his other work, it couldn&amp;rsquo;t really hurt his grade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Is what David did wrong? Why or why not? Do you think David is right in thinking that this assignment really doesn&amp;#39;t matter and can&amp;#39;t really hurt his grade because it is only for extra credit?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Case Study #2:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Janie has just moved to the Twin Cities from a non-English speaking county. It is hard to fit in, understand the language, and make friends. She misses her family and it is sometimes difficult for her to concentrate on all her classes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She is taking a biology class this semester, which turns out to be much harder than she thought it would be. In one of the tests, the answers are to be marked by blackening out lettered circles on a separate answer sheet. Janie studied as hard as she could, but it seemed she did not read the topics that most of the questions on the test covered. Near tears, she hands in her test answers and sits down at her desk to await the end of class. To her right, Mark is working on his test. He seems to have no trouble with the class and is carefully marking his own answers. Glancing at his answer sheet, Janie sees that he has marked several answers differently than hers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Janie goes up to the proctor and asks for her test answer sheet back, saying that she just remembered she did not correctly put in her student ID number. She quickly erases and changes some answers to reflect what she saw on Mark&amp;rsquo;s paper and hands it back in again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some time later, the instructor informs Janie that the proctor saw her change her answers. She is going to be given an &quot;F&quot; for the test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Janie thinks her actions do not constitute plagiarism or academic dishonesty, and that the sanction is too harsh, especially after she describes what she feels are extenuating circumstances. Is she right? Does Janie have to accept the instructor&amp;#39;s sanction? Do you have any ideas about better ways for Janie to handle this problem in the future?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Case Study #3:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chris, Todd, and Mike are assigned to work on several group assignments together in a history class this semester. One of their projects includes each of them researching different events on a given time line, and then combining the information together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a test that covers some of the information gathered by Todd, Mike cannot remember what the answers are. He reasons that because the three of them had worked on the project together as a collaboration and got a good grade, it shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be a problem to ask Todd what the answers are. Since they sit not far from each other in class, Mike asks Todd to tell him the answers. Todd does not want to offend his friend, so he moves his arm so Mike can see his paper. Chris also sits nearby, and sees this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Is this plagiarism/academic dishonesty? Are all three of them at fault? Is Mike more so than Todd? Is Chris obligated to tell the instructor what he saw?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Case Study #4:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jennifer really enjoys the art history class she is taking this semester. She spends a lot of time on her final project&amp;mdash;a portfolio of works of art that she selects, writes a brief background about the artist, and then describes what she feels about the piece. She is careful to make sure all her information about the artists is correct, and reads several essays on the artists she has chosen. She agrees with most of what the essayists have to say regarding the pieces. She represents some of their thoughts in her project as her own, reasoning that since it is not fact, and instead intangible opinion, and because she agrees with them, then she is not plagiarizing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Is she right or wrong? Why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://online.science.psu.edu/biol110_sandbox_2381/node/9012" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read responses of others.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Case Study #5:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lee has to write a paper on some of the causes and symptoms of drug abuse for a public health class. He accesses the Web and finds several chat rooms that feature posted questions which are answered by doctors. He uses their answers in his paper, citing just &quot;Internet&quot; as the source. He also finds a site that is put together by the mother of a recovering addict which contains information that she has compiled as a resource for other families in similar circumstances. Steve also uses this information, and since the author of the site does not indicate which books she got the information from, he cites &quot;Internet&quot; again as the source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Is this sufficient? Is this a form of plagiarism/academic dishonesty? Why or why not?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://online.science.psu.edu/node/8948" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read responses of others.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Case Study #6:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jack and Diane are both in business class. Toward the end of the semester, the assignment is to do an analysis of a business plan. The paper is due in a couple of days and due to a family emergency, followed by being in bed all weekend with the flu, Jack hasn&amp;rsquo;t had a chance to work on the paper and is very stressed out. Diane feels badly for Jack and since she has finished her analysis, she offers to loan Jack a copy of her paper so he can look it over to get a sense of how she broke down the assignment and then structured her response, figuring that should help Jack not feel so overwhelmed and make the project manageable. Jack gratefully accepts the offer. Diane sends him her analysis in an e-mail attachment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;At this point, is this academic dishonesty? If so, what kind (plagiarism, cheating, etc.) and why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://online.science.psu.edu/biol110_sandbox_2381/node/9014" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read responses of others.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Jack reads over Diane&amp;rsquo;s paper, he agrees with the majority of Diane&amp;rsquo;s analysis, but there are a few things that he would word a bit differently. Jack reasons that since he agrees with Diana&amp;rsquo;s concepts, it would make more sense to make a full copy of Diane&amp;rsquo;s paper and go through it line by line, changing the sentences to sound like him. Occasionally he adds a couple of sentences to expand on a thought. He then creates a coversheet with only his name on it and turns it in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;At this point, is this academic dishonesty? If so, what kind and why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://online.science.psu.edu/biol110_sandbox_2381/node/9014" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read responses of others.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Prof. Mellencamp reads through the analysis, he is struck by the similarity between Jack and Diane&amp;rsquo;s papers, in fact when he compares them, he realizes that they are outlined identically and in parts, they are worded identically and even where the wording varies, the concepts are the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you were Diane, how could you explain your role in what transpired?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Case Study #7:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Susan and Lucy are both international students from Narnia and in the same science class. Lucy has a strong grasp of the English language and is doing well in her classes. Susan&amp;rsquo;s grasp of the English language is not nearly as strong as Lucy&amp;rsquo;s. With Lucy&amp;rsquo;s help, she&amp;rsquo;s working hard to expand her standard English vocabulary, plus learn all of the science vocabulary. But Susan is having a hard time retaining the information, most likely because she isn&amp;rsquo;t eating or sleeping well. One day, there is an exam in their science lab. Susan is having a hard time understanding what is being asked in the questions and therefore doesn&amp;rsquo;t know what to put down for the answers. She starts to panic that she&amp;rsquo;ll fail the lab and the class. The TA notices that Susan and Lucy are talking to each other in Narnian and he asks them what they are talking about. Lucy explains that she is only translating the questions for Susan. The TA asks them not to talk and if Susan has questions about the test, then she should bring them to him (the TA). Susan asks him about one of the questions, but the TA can&amp;rsquo;t explain it without giving away the answer, so Susan goes back to her seat, uncertain what to do. Twice more during the exam, he catches Susan and Lucy talking in Narnian. Again, he tells them to stop talking. The TA knows Lucy is a solid student and thinks it is very possible that Lucy is only translating the question and is not providing Susan with the answers, but he isn&amp;rsquo;t sure. He decides to report the situation to the professor who teaches this section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Is this a case of academic dishonesty? What would you have done if you were in Lucy&amp;rsquo;s place? How could the problem have been solved differently?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Case Study #8:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last semester Ben took an ecology class and one of the papers he wrote was about the effects of DDT on bald eagles. This semester he is taking a wildlife biology class and realizes that his paper from last semester would work for one of the assignments for this semester too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Is it academic dishonesty for Ben to turn the same paper in twice? What is the best thing for Ben to do in this situation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://online.science.psu.edu/biol110_sandbox_2381/node/9017" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read responses of others.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Case Study #9:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shawn and Mimi are in the same program with about 40 other students. It is Mimi&amp;rsquo;s first year in the program and Shawn&amp;rsquo;s second year. This year Mimi has an assistantship in the same office where Shawn had an assistant last year. At some point, Mimi finds several papers that Shawn wrote last year on the hard drive of the office computer. She sees that one of the papers matches an assignment coming due soon; an assignment that Mimi sees as being a lot of detail work that she&amp;rsquo;ll never use in the real world. Shawn&amp;rsquo;s paper is well written and so Mimi lifts large sections of it and uses them in her paper, which she turns in to the same faculty member who taught the class last year when Shawn took the course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;If you were Shawn and the faculty member called you in about the similarity in the papers, what would you say? What would your reaction be to Mimi?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://online.science.psu.edu/biol110_sandbox_2381/node/9016" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read responses of others.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;What if the faculty member did not notice the text was plagiarized, but one night when you, Mimi, and some other people from your program are out socializing, Mimi told you what she had done. How would you react?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://online.science.psu.edu/biol110_sandbox_2381/node/9016" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read responses of others.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Case Study #10:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are in a large, lecture-style class. Because of the size of the class, the tests are all bubble sheets and because the chairs are bolted down and students need to sit right next to each other, the faculty member has three variations of the test and they are layered so that students sitting next to each other will not have the same version of the test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As tests are being handed out, you notice that this one person doesn&amp;rsquo;t take the question sheet on the top, but pulls one out of the stack and then compares it with the person to his left before passing the stack on to the next person in the row. During the test you notice that the way they are positioning their bodies and answer sheets, these two people are comparing answers as they go along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;What do you do?&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;This is where you will need to draw on your own personal philosophy of academic integrity. Will you turn your eyes away and act like nothing is happening because, after all, it&amp;#39;s none of your business? Will you tell one of the people proctoring the exam and hope that they will just separate the two students and let them continue to take the exam since they really haven&amp;#39;t cheated yet? Will you wait until the test is finished and talk to the two people who were cheating, maybe asking them to turn themselves in?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <body>&lt;div class="art-postcontent"&gt;
	&lt;div class="art-article"&gt;
		&lt;h6&gt;&lt;em&gt;Is what David did wrong? Why or why not? Do you think David is right in thinking that this assignment really doesn&amp;#39;t matter and can&amp;#39;t really hurt his grade because it is only for extra credit? &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response 1: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is an example of sloppy work that qualifies as plagiarism and could have serious consequences for David, including the possibility of a lower grade. It doesn&amp;#39;t matter that the assignment is only for extra credit, if David is going to take time to do the assignment, he needs to do his best work. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response 2:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;As an instructor, I believe I would make him resubmit the assignment before giving extra credit. First, if the assignment is to reflect on the readings, proper citation is needed in order for a reader to separate the content of the original article from the author&amp;#39;s reaction to it. Second, it is good practice to track citations during the research and paper writing process; famous historians have had their careers ruined with plagiarism scandals because &quot;they forgot to put in quotes.&quot; I believe, a student can genuinely forget to put in the quotes in a paper. I know of one case where a student did not use proper citations, but had the correct entry in the bibliography. It is not necessarily conscious plagiarism, but it is bad paper writing form and should be addressed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response 3: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;My take on this is that David is wrong because he has had the opportunity to learn to do things the right way during his college career, and when he chooses not to use the skills he has built he is taking a step backwards (not to mention that what he is doing by using quotes without citing properly is illegal). Going to college is not supposed to be about the grades as much as it is about the education itself. Having a good education only counts if you use it, and the more you use it the greater the rewards. If you just do the work to get by, then when you get out in the workforce and have greater responsibilities life will be much harder for you because you have not learned the proper skills and spend more time getting out of using them than actually accomplishing good work that will bring you rewards and greater responsibility.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;

	&lt;div class="art-article"&gt;
		&lt;h6&gt;Janie thinks her actions do not constitute plagiarism or academic dishonesty, and that the sanction is too harsh, especially after she describes what she feels are extenuating circumstances. Is she right? Do you have any ideas about better ways for Janie to handle this problem in the future?&lt;/h6&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response 1: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The fact that Janie has trouble with English isn&amp;#39;t justification for copying answers from another student&amp;#39;s paper. The instructor didn&amp;#39;t really have any choice in the matter -- the rules are very clear. The student got caught cheating so the &quot;F&quot; grade on the test is appropriate in this instance. Since Janie disagrees, she doesn&amp;#39;t have to accept the sanction, she can appeal to the College academic integrity committee. Obviously Janie realized that she was having trouble with comprehension well before the exam. There are many resources available to students who are having trouble that Janie could have used in addition to asking the instructor for additional help. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response 2:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;It&amp;#39;s hard to admit you may be having difficulty with a class, but copying answers and risking an F is not a good solution. If you sense early in the semester that you are feeling lost, you may want to approach another student, talk with your instructor or go to the University Learning Centers and schedule extra tutoring. Oddly, this could become a good chance for you to meet other people at the university. This IS a clear case of cheating because Janie copied answers from another student. Unfortunately, &quot;stress&quot; is not usually considered an extenuating circumstance. Failure may be embarrassing, but not as embarrassing as failure because of academic dishonesty.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response 3: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Janie&amp;#39;s actions clearly constitute deceitful behavior and academic dishonesty. The sanction is justified for her action. If Janie learns to use deceit to &quot;get by&quot; in challenging situations during her academic years, she will probably continue the behavior out in the workforce. I would not want her working for or with me. These sanctions are in place to reinforce important information. They should not be waived for challenging circumstances. She could have talked with the professor and asked for extra time to study for her test, or she could have asked more questions about what subject items were going to be on the test so she could better focus her studies. Communication between student and instructor throughout the duration of the course is important and it is incumbent on the student to be proactive about it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;h6&gt;Is this plagiarism or academic dishonesty? Are all three of them at fault? Is Mike more so than Todd? Is Chris obligated to tell the instructor what he saw?&lt;/h6&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response 1: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is cheating. When completing a group assignment, it is the responsibility of each member to know all of the content, not just the content of their particular piece. Chris might need to talk to the instructor, but first he needs to talk to his friends and try to persuade them to go to the instructor themselves. If that fails, then Chris is obliged to tell the instructor what he knows. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response 2:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Although the instructor may not say this, you should assume that you are responsible for knowing ALL the content of a group project, not just the part you worked on individually. In a test-taking situation, it is generally safe to assume that no collaboration will be allowed UNLESS the instructor says otherwise. Todd and Chris may want to help their friend Mike, but if Mike were caught, both of them could be implicated and have their grades affected also.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response 3: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is academic dishonesty. Though several people might work on a project together, they all should take responsibility for understanding the whole project. Communication is important here, so that all participants on the project are well informed during its creation and at its completion. I wouldn&amp;#39;t want these people working for or with me, since I couldn&amp;#39;t trust their accountability for their own work or for the project as a whole. I can imagine if one of them ended up leading a team project out in the workforce they might turn out to be the kind of person who would blame other team members for delays or obstacles, rather than the kind of person who would take responsibility and go the extra mile to get successful project results. I don&amp;#39;t know that Chris is obligated to tell the instructor. It is the instructor&amp;#39;s job to monitor security during a test. It would be a hard decision for Chris--I do know that if it were me in that position I would avoid the others in the future.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;

		&lt;h6&gt;Is she right or wrong? Why?&lt;/h6&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response 1: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yes, she is wrong. This is plagiarism. Jennifer is taking someone else&amp;#39;s work and presenting it as her own. Even though she is of the same opinion as the authors of the essays, she still needs to give them credit for their work. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response 2: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;An author&amp;#39;s analysis is a piece of &quot;intellectual property&quot; and does need to be cited and acknowledged. An instructor is not necessarily interested in an new analysis, but what the opinion of the student is. If Jennifer does agree with the essays she reads, she should cite them and explain WHY she agrees. This shows the instructor how carefully she did think about her projects.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response 3: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thoughts cannot be copyrighted, so there seems to be no direct infringement in this case, but there is a fine line between having and writing thoughts that are similar to something you have read and using direct quotes. If it were me, I would use a direct quote, cite it properly, then elaborate on it using my own words. I would do this for each thought or idea that paralleled what I had read. Writing this way works in her favor, because using direct quotes, cited properly, lends credibility to her writing and strength to her ideas.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;h6&gt;Is this sufficient? Is this a form or plagiarism or academic dishonesty? Why or why not?&lt;/h6&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response 1: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is an example of sloppy work that could result in serious consequences. It is important to CORRECTLY cite all sources of information. &quot;Internet&quot; is not a correct citation. It is also dangerous to include information in a research paper that was found on the Web but that can&amp;#39;t be verified. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response 2:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; It is not plagiarism because he provides a citation, but he does need more information. Most scholars recommend an Internet citation include the specific URL, and the author of the site, and when the site was created. If no dates can be found, then putting down when the site was viewed is sufficient. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response 3: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is a form of plagiarism. There are several correct ways to cite Internet sources. Students can find information at online sites, such as: &lt;a class="ext" href="http://www.bedfordstmartins.com/online/citex.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.bedfordstmartins.com/online/citex.html&lt;/a&gt;, or&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="ext" href="http://www.apastyle.org/elecref.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.apastyle.org/elecref.html&lt;/a&gt;. If Lee finds it necessary to use the material compiled by the woman who did not cite her resources, at the very least he should quote her directly and cite her as the primary source. I would avoid using her material, however, no matter how good it is. If she obtained it from different resources, chances are he could also search out the original resources she used and cite properly any material directly quoted.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

		&lt;h2&gt;Case Study 6A&lt;/h2&gt;
		&lt;h6&gt;At this point, is this academic dishonesty? If so, what kind (plagiarism, cheating, etc.) and why?&lt;/h6&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response 1: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;At this point I would say this behavior shows poor judgment on Diane&amp;#39;s part, but is not academic dishonesty. It would have been better for Jack to go to the instructor, explain his circumstances, and see if it would be possible to get an extension.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response 2:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; I think not, because Diane is showing an example of what she did. In the business world, looking at other examples is called &quot;benchmarking&quot;, but can lead to plagiarism if the author is not careful.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response 3: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;No, at this point this is only collaboration. The work of other students, shared by consent, is not plagiarism.&amp;nbsp; What Jack does with this information is what will constitute plagiarism, or not. He can read her material to see how she structured things, but when he applies himself to doing the assignment he must make sure his own work is original within the specifications of the assignment (she may have used formulas or guidelines preset by the instructor, which are fine to reproduce, but the content itself should reflect Jack&amp;#39;s own analysis). Here I would recommend that Jack communicate with the professor to see if he can get an extension so he can do a proper job on the analysis. I would also recommend that Jack not use her paper as a reference while he is completing his assignment. It&amp;#39;s okay to read it once or twice, but it&amp;#39;s better used as a form of research, not a firm guideline to follow. If he were to follow her structure very closely, even though he might choose different words, this would constitute a form of plagiarism in that the work would not be completely his own.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;h2&gt;Case Study 6B&lt;/h2&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="art-postcontent"&gt;
	&lt;div class="art-article"&gt;
		&lt;h6&gt;At this point, is this academic dishonesty? If so, what kind and why?&lt;/h6&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response 1: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yes, this is academic dishonesty. Jack is using Diane&amp;#39;s work and presenting it as his own. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response 2:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; This is done in the business world sometimes, but should be avoided in courses. Because Jack is using Diane&amp;#39;s paper as a reference, he has not done his own analysis from scratch. In copyright terms, he is creating a &quot;derivative product&quot; and would need Diane&amp;#39;s permission to do so. In academic terms, it will likely cause him problems because he has NOT done the analysis from scratch. In addition, since this will be based on Diane&amp;#39;s writing style and organization, the document will more than likely resemble Diane&amp;#39;s.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response 3: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yes, this is academic dishonesty. Jack is bypassing most of the procedures involved in creating an original work and is simply rephrasing parts of Diane&amp;#39;s work. This is clearly not his own work, and constitutes plagiarism.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;h2&gt;Case Study 6C&lt;/h2&gt;
		&lt;div class="art-postcontent"&gt;
			&lt;div class="art-article"&gt;
				&lt;h6&gt;If you were Diane, how could you explain your role in what transpired?&lt;/h6&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response 1: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;By now Diane probably recognized that she put her own academic integrity at risk when she gave her paper to Jack as a reference, although she didn&amp;#39;t intend for him to copy her work. Diane needs to be honest about what she did even though it makes her look like an accomplice.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response 2:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Diane is in a very tough situation. She probably had the best of intentions when sharing her paper, but look at the trouble Jack caused. If this is a first time incident, and she has the e-mails saved, it will help Prof. Mellencamp understand what her intentions were. In the future, Diane might think about sharing general research hints with her friends rather than a finished document. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response 3: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Diane should not necessarily be blamed for sharing her work. Very often, in the workforce, people review material that covers similar subject matter so that they can create original work without &quot;reinventing the wheel&quot; or covering material that has already been detailed. They can get good ideas about what works and what does not work in the final presentation of material. However, it is important with each new project or assignment (whether academic or real-world) to start fresh and customize material each time. Customizing material takes a lot more work than just changing a few words. It takes additional research, as well as rethinking the material and presenting it so that original thoughts, ideas, facts, etc. are conveyed properly. If I were Diane and wanted to show my work to another student I would probably meet them for a little while and let them look over a hardcopy, then take it with me when I left. This way a person can get help, maybe ask some questions, talk over their ideas, but not actually sit down and copy someone else&amp;#39;s work. There is value in collaboration, but it is important for people sharing their own work to take some protective measures.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;div class="art-article"&gt;
		&lt;h6&gt;Is this a case of academic dishonesty? What would you have done if you were in Lucy&amp;rsquo;s place? How could the problem have been solved differently?&lt;/h6&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response 1: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lucy put her own grade at risk by not doing as the TA said. Now both she and Susan could receive failing grades on the exam. It would have been better if Lucy and Susan had talked to the professor about Lucy&amp;#39;s problems with English well before the exam. The professor might have been able to accommodate Lucy&amp;#39;s needs better if he had know there was a problem.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response 2:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; This is a very tough situation. I do not believe it was academic dishonesty, but it is a situation that should be avoided because it is so ambiguous. If Susan had a hearing disability or learning, she would be able to ask the Office of Disability services to arrange for extra accommodation. Although lack of English proficiency is not &quot;recognized&quot; as a disability, Susan might still want to speak with her advisor about her problems with English in the class. If this were early in the semester, it might make sense to receive extra tutoring in scientific English.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If I were an instructor, I would re-test Susan, possibly with a Narnian translator present. I would also speak with Lucy, but it would have to be a judgment call as to whether I thought she was being truthful.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response 3: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is a situation where Lucy has allowed herself to be put into a compromising position. Her reputation is in jeopardy whether or not she is only translating the questions. Susan should have been tested (TOEFL) before being allowed to register for the class to see if she could handle the vocabulary. She also should communicate with the professor early in the duration of the course to make him or her aware of her challenge with the English language and science vocabulary. Early measures can be agreed upon between Susan and the professor so that she can be helped to study and pass the tests. If she cannot qualify properly due to her language problems she should be directed to take some English language courses.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;

		&lt;h6&gt;If you were Shawn and the faculty member called you in about the similarity in the papers, what would you say? What would your reaction be to Mimi?&lt;/h6&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response 1: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The best policy is honesty. Shawn should explain that he didn&amp;#39;t give the paper to Mimi and doesn&amp;#39;t know where she got it. As Shawn, I would be very angry with Mimi for taking my work and causing problems for me. I would ask her to go to the professor and tell the truth about where she got my paper. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response 2:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;If I were Shawn I would be angry for several reasons. One is Mimi was snooping around in my file space without my permission. Another is that she risked my being accused of academic dishonesty with a project I no doubt put in a lot of time and effort on.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response 3: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;If I were Shawn and were called by the faculty member I would explain that I had not been proactive in securing my files when I left the position Mimi took over. I might also add that I was unaware that she could access these files. If I spoke to Mimi about it I would let her know that she had compromised my reputation and integrity by using my work without my permission, and suggest that she talk with the professor about it. I would also warn her that this behavior puts her own reputation and integrity in jeopardy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;h6&gt;What if the faculty member did not notice the text was plagiarized, but one night when you, Mimi, and some other people from your program are out socializing, Mimi told you what she had done. How would you react?&lt;/h6&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response 1: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;I would be angry that Mimi had put me in such an awkward position and risked my academic standing by plagiarizing my paper. I would encourage her to go to the professor and confess. If she refused to do so, I would have to in order to stay out of trouble myself.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response 2: &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;If I found out after the fact, I might not turn Mimi in, but I probably would not trust her in the same way again. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response 3: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;I would let Mimi know that this behavior not only compromises her own reputation and integrity but also whoever might be the original creator of the work (in this case, Shawn). In some cases much more serious consequences can result, such as expulsion from the university. Out in the workforce the consequences can cost the individual or the corporation the individual works for thousands of dollars in fines and royalty fees and many setbacks, as well as status in the marketplace, and the integrity of their reputation. In some cases, an individual can even be arrested and jailed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;div class="art-article"&gt;
		&lt;h6&gt;Is it academic dishonesty for Ben to turn the same paper in twice? What is the best thing for Ben to do in this situation?&lt;/h6&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response 1: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yes, it is dishonest for Ben to just turn in the same paper twice. It would be better if he talked to the professor about the assignment, explained that he has already written a paper, and perhaps propose ideas for further developing the paper that might also satisfy the requirements for the current assignment. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response 2:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; Penn State policy says approval from an instructor should be gotten first. It is counter-intuitive that you would be cheating with your own work, but the point is to make sure you put in a certain level of effort for each course. As an instructor, I would ask to see Ben&amp;#39;s paper, and would more than likely require he do further research to expand on the paper. This would be a great chance for Ben to follow-up more on a topic he was interested in previously. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response 3:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;It is common practice for published writers to spend several weeks or months researching a subject and then write several articles on the same subject for publication in a variety of periodicals, using the same base of research material. It is NOT legal to sell the exact same article to more than one publisher unless the party holding the copyright (author) has sold particular rights specifying that the publisher can only publish the article once (reprint rights) and the original copyright holder retains the right to sell the work in its original form to another publisher. Very often a contract will specify a period of time that must pass before the copyright holder can resell the work in this manner.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In this case it is fine for Ben to use the &lt;strong&gt;research material&lt;/strong&gt; he covered in a previous class to complete this assignment but after completion, the assignment must be unrecognizable from the original paper. It is not okay to hand in the same paper for two different classes, even though the work is original. The purpose of education is to build and use skills, so if a student learns a skill and does not actually use it, but depends on work previously done, the full benefit of the knowledge goes untapped. So a student is really only hurting him- or herself in making this choice. At the very least, Ben can use the research material he used for the original paper again, and perhaps the bibliography, but he should rethink the content, structure, and presentation of concepts completely. It might be safest to choose a completely new subject and start from scratch.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Code of Conduct for Penn State Students</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="ext" href="http://studentaffairs.psu.edu/conduct/pdf/CodeofConduct.PDF" target="_blank"&gt;Student Code of Conduct (PDF)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Code of Conduct describes behaviors that are inconsistent with the essential values of the University community. Intentionally attempting or assisting in these behaviors may be considered as serious as engaging in the behavior. A person commits an attempt when, with intent to commit a specific violation of the Code of Conduct, he/she performs any act that constitutes a substantial step toward the commission of that violation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Links are provided for University policy statements that inform the Code of Conduct. The Code of Conduct behaviors include, but are not limited to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. ABUSE/ENDANGERMENT/HAZING OF A PERSON: Physically harming or threatening to harm any person, intentionally or recklessly causing harm to any person or reasonable apprehension of such harm or creating a condition that endangers the health and safety of self or others, including through the facilitation of or participation in any mental or physical hazing activity (also see &lt;a class="ext" href="http://studentaffairs.psu.edu/conduct/pdf/PoliciesRules.PDF" target="_blank"&gt;Policy Statement 8&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. SEXUAL MISCONDUCT OR ABUSE: The University does not tolerate sexual misconduct or abuse, such as sexual assault, rape or any other forms of nonconsensual sexual activity. Sexual misconduct and abuse can occur between acquaintances or parties unknown to each other. Sexual abuse is attempted or actual unwanted sexual activity, such as sexual touching and fondling. This includes the touching of an unwilling person&amp;#39;s intimate parts (defined as genitalia, groin, breast or buttock, or clothing covering them), or forcing an unwilling person to touch another&amp;#39;s intimate parts. Sexual misconduct includes, but is not limited to, sexual assault, rape, forcible sodomy or sexual penetration with an inanimate object, intercourse without consent, under conditions of force, threat of force, fear or when a person is unable to give consent because of substance abuse, captivity, sleep or disability (also see &lt;a class="ext" href="http://guru.psu.edu/policies/Ad12.html" target="_blank"&gt;Policy AD-12&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. HARASSMENT CREATING HOSTILE ENVIRONMENT, AND HARASSMENT OR STALKING OF ANY PERSON: Harassment creating a hostile environment is a violation of University policy. Such harassment is a form of discrimination consisting of physical or verbal conduct that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;(a) is directed at an individual because of the individual&amp;#39;s age, ancestry, color, disability or handicap, national origin, race, religious creed, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or veteran status; and&lt;br /&gt;
		(b) is sufficiently severe or pervasive so as to substantially interfere with the individual&amp;#39;s employment, education or access to University programs, activities and opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To constitute harassment creating a hostile environment, the conduct must be such that it detrimentally affects the individual in question and would also detrimentally affect a reasonable person under the same circumstances. This harassment may include, but is not limited to, verbal or physical attacks, threats, slurs, or derogatory comments or threats of such conduct, that meet the definition set forth above. Whether the alleged conduct constitutes prohibited harassment depends on the totality of the particular circumstances, including the nature, frequency and duration of the conduct in question, the location and context in which it occurs and the status of the individuals involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;General harassment or stalking of any person is a violation of University policy. A person violates this section when, with the intent to harass or alarm another, the person&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;(a) subjects the other person or group of persons to unwanted physical contact or threat of such contact; or&lt;br /&gt;
		(b) engages in a course of conduct, including following the person without proper authority, under circumstances which demonstrate intent to place the other person in reasonable fear of bodily injury or to cause the other person substantial emotional distress (also see &lt;a class="ext" href="http://studentaffairs.psu.edu/conduct/pdf/PoliciesRules.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Policy Statement 7&lt;/a&gt;, and Policies &lt;a class="ext" href="http://guru.psu.edu/policies/Ad41.html" target="_blank"&gt;AD-41&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="ext" href="http://guru.psu.edu/policies/Ad42.html" target="_blank"&gt;AD-42&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. WEAPONS, FIREARMS, AND PAINTBALL DEVICES: The possession, storing, carrying, or use of any weapon, ammunition, or explosive by any person is prohibited on all University property except by authorized law enforcement officers and other persons specifically authorized by the University. No person shall possess, carry, or use any fireworks on University property, except for those persons authorized by University and local governments to discharge such fireworks as part of a public display. Paintball guns and paintball markers may only be used on the property of the University in connection with authorized University activities and only at approved locations (also see &lt;a class="ext" href="http://guru.psu.edu/policies/Sy12.html" target="_blank"&gt;SY-12&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5. FIRE SAFETY VIOLATIONS: Tampering with fire or other safety equipment or setting unauthorized fires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6. ALCOHOL AND/OR DRUGS: Illegally possessing, using, distributing, manufacturing, selling or being under the influence of alcohol or other drugs. Use, possession or distribution of beverages containing alcohol on University property shall comply with the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and University Policies and Rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Note: Anyone, including those under 21, serving alcohol to persons under 21 is in violation of both University regulations and state law. Excessive consumption occurs when a person is intoxicated to the degree that the person may endanger self, other persons, or property, or annoy persons in the vicinity. (also see Policies &lt;a class="ext" href="http://guru.psu.edu/policies/Ad18.html" target="_blank"&gt;AD-18&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="ext" href="http://guru.psu.edu/policies/Ad33.html" target="_blank"&gt;AD-33&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="ext" href="http://studentaffairs.psu.edu/conduct/pdf/PoliciesRules.PDF" target="_blank"&gt;Policy Statement 3&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;It is also a violation a violation of the &lt;a class="ext" href="http://www.hfs.psu.edu/housing/firstyear/policies.shtml" target="_blank"&gt;residence hall contract&lt;/a&gt; for a student to be in the presence of the presence of the use of illegal drugs or if under 21 years of age, alcohol, in any residential area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7. FALSE INFORMATION: Intentionally providing false or inaccurate information or records to University or local authorities. Providing a false report of an emergency, University rule and/or Code violation. Knowingly providing false statements or testimony during a University investigation or proceeding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8. THEFT AND OTHER PROPERTY OFFENSES: Stealing, vandalizing, damaging, destroying, or defacing University property or the property of others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9. DISRUPTION OF OPERATIONS: Obstruction or disruption of classes, research projects, or other activities or programs of the University; or obstructing access to University facilities, property, or programs. Disruption is defined as an action or combination of actions by one or more individuals that unreasonably interferes with, hinders, obstructs, or prevents the operation of the University or infringes on the rights of others to freely participate in its programs and services (also see &lt;a class="ext" href="http://studentaffairs.psu.edu/conduct/pdf/PoliciesRules.PDF" target="_blank"&gt;Policy Statement 1&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10. ACADEMIC DISHONESTY:Academic integrity is the pursuit of scholarly activity in an open, honest and responsible manner. Academic integrity is a basic guiding principle for all academic activity at The Pennsylvania State University, and all members of the University community are expected to act in accordance with this principle. Consistent with this expectation, students should act with personal integrity, respect other students&amp;#39; dignity, rights and property, and help create and maintain an environment in which all can succeed through the fruits of their efforts.&amp;nbsp; Academic integrity includes a commitment not to engage in or tolerate acts of falsification, misrepresentation or deception. Such acts of dishonesty violate the fundamental ethical principles of the University community and compromise the worth of work completed by others (see &lt;a class="ext" href="http://www.psu.edu/ufs/policies/47-00.html#49-20" target="_blank"&gt;Faculty Senate Policy 49-20&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="ext" href="http://www.psu.edu/dept/oue/aappm/G-9.html" target="_blank"&gt;G-9 Procedures&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11. FAILURE TO COMPLY: Failing to comply with reasonable directives from University or other officials when directed to do so. Failure to provide identification or to report to an administrative office or, when reasonable cause exists, failing to leave University-controlled premises or dangerous situations when directed to do so by properly authorized persons, including police and/or other University staff. This charge may be added to other charges, e.g., when a student fails to leave a residence hall during a fire drill and refuses to leave when directed to do so by a University official.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;12. FORGERY/ALTERATION: Making, using or possessing any falsified University document or official record; altering or forging any University document or record, including identification, meal or access cards. This includes but is not limited to; forging (signing another&amp;#39;s name and/or ID number) key request forms, manufacturing IDs or tickets, altering permits, misuse of forms (letterhead stationery, University forms), and keys to mislead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;13. UNAUTHORIZED ENTRY OR USE: Unauthorized entry into or use of property or University facilities including residence halls, classrooms, offices, and other restricted facilities. Unauthorized entry or use of facilities is referred to in the University policy regarding the rights of individuals and the rights of the institution. Specifically, policy refers to an &quot;obligation not to infringe upon the rights of all members of the campus to privacy in offices, laboratories and residence hall rooms, and in the keeping of personal papers, confidential records and effects, subject only to the general law and University regulations.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The University also has the right to control use and entry into facilities for reasons of security, safety or protection of property. This includes closing facilities at specified times. It should also be recognized that an open or unlocked door is not an invitation to enter and use facilities. The same concept applies to computer entry or misuse, including violation of any University computer policy (also see &lt;a class="ext" href="http://guru.psu.edu/policies/Ad20.html" target="_blank"&gt;Policy AD-20&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="ext" href="http://studentaffairs.psu.edu/conduct/pdf/PoliciesRules.PDF" target="_blank"&gt;Policy Statement 4&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;14. DISORDERLY CONDUCT: Engaging in disorderly, disruptive, lewd or indecent conduct. The item includes but is not limited to: inciting or participating in a riot or group disruption; failing to leave the scene of a riot or group disruption when instructed by officials; disruption of programs, classroom activities or functions and processes of the University; creating unreasonable noise; or creating a physically hazardous or physically offensive condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;15. VIOLATIONS OF UNIVERSITY REGULATIONS: Violating written University policy or regulations contained in any official publications, administrative announcements, contracts and/or postings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;16. VIOLATION OF LAW: When it is established that a student has violated federal, state, or local law and the violation of law affects a Substantial University Interest, the student may be charged within the Code of Conduct for Violation of Law.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <title>Integrity Introduction</title>
    <body>&lt;blockquote&gt;
	&lt;ul&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;What is Academic Integrity?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;Why is Academic Integrity Important?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is Academic Integrity?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that you are in college and attending classes, you need to consider what it means to have academic integrity. Whether you are attending Penn State right out of high school or are a student returning to school after having spent some time away from an educational institution, it is important to have a clear understanding of your ethical responsibilities as a student and a member of the Penn State community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Activity 1:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Integrity can be a difficult quality to define. Take a minute to think about what it means to have integrity. Is there someone in your life or someone you know about who you admire? What are the qualities you admire most? Honesty? Hard work? Dependability? Personal consistency? Selflessness? Behaving responsibly? Do you strive to posses these same qualities? Which qualities do you think are most important to possess in order to have a fulfilling life and a successful career? Use the &quot;My Notes&quot; tool on the right side of the tool bar at the top of the page to jot down some of your ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Academic integrity&lt;/strong&gt; is one of the four &lt;a class="ext" href="http://www.psu.edu/ur/2001/principles.html" target="_blank"&gt;Penn State Principles&lt;/a&gt;. The statement in &lt;a class="ext" href="http://www.psu.edu/ufs/policies/47-00.html#49-20" target="_blank"&gt;Policy 49-20&lt;/a&gt; of the Faculty Senate reads:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Academic integrity is the pursuit of scholarly activity in an open, honest and responsible manner. Academic integrity is a basic guiding principle for all academic activity at The Pennsylvania State University, and all members of the University community are expected to act in accordance with this principle. Consistent with this expectation, the University&amp;#39;s Code of Conduct states that all students should act with personal integrity, respect other students&amp;#39; dignity, rights and property, and help create and maintain an environment in which all can succeed through the fruits of their efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p align="right"&gt;--&lt;a class="ext" href="http://www.psu.edu/ufs/policies/47-00.html#49-20" target="_blank"&gt;www.psu.edu/ufs/policies/47-00.html#49-20&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acts which violate the University&amp;#39;s Code of conduct are considered acts of &lt;strong&gt;academic dishonesty.&lt;/strong&gt; These include (but are not limited to) plagiarism, cheating, and copyright violations. Some examples of different acts of academic dishonesty are listed at &lt;a class="ext" href="http://www.pserie.psu.edu/faculty/academics/integrity.htm" target="_blank"&gt;www.pserie.psu.edu/faculty/academics/integrity.htm. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why is Academic Integrity Important?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did you know that employers are allowed to give tests to candidates for certain jobs to rate their level of integrity? Integrity is a characteristic employers seek just like good work ethics, reliability, and dependability. A personal philosophy of integrity is something that is unique to each individual and takes some time and thought to develop. A university setting provides a rich environment in which to work on developing a personal philosophy of integrity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a student at Penn State you will face many challenges, and opportunities to demonstrate integrity in your work. Cheating, plagiarism, and copyright violations are all considered violations of Penn State&amp;#39;s academic integrity policy. Academic dishonesty hurts everyone in the community. It not only damages your personal reputation but also the reputation of the entire university.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, many students commit accidental violations of academic integrity simply because they don&amp;#39;t know that what they are doing is wrong. Others say they &quot;had&quot; to cheat because they didn&amp;#39;t have enough time to complete all of the work, or because &quot;everyone else&quot; is cheating and they won&amp;#39;t get a good grade unless they cheat too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The information in this module will help you better understand what constitutes academic dishonesty and how to avoid committing acts of academic dishonesty.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

		&lt;h2&gt;What is Copyright?&lt;/h2&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lori: &lt;/strong&gt;So are we ready to put this team project together?&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sage:&lt;/strong&gt; I am. I&amp;rsquo;ve got other assignments to finish before the semester is over.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deena:&lt;/strong&gt; Me too.&amp;nbsp; Let&amp;rsquo;s get going.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brian:&lt;/strong&gt; We&amp;rsquo;ve got all the basic information we need, but I think we could jazz up our presentation by having the students take a survey in class.&amp;nbsp; I found a survey online that we could use.&amp;nbsp; You&amp;rsquo;re supposed to pay for the surveys, but they cost $1.00 each. We can just make copies on my dad&amp;rsquo;s copier.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jose:&lt;/strong&gt; Let me see that.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deena: &lt;/strong&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know guys, this sounds like stealing to me.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sage:&lt;/strong&gt; I&amp;rsquo;m with Deena.&amp;nbsp; I think this is a copyright violation.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lori:&lt;/strong&gt; What&amp;rsquo;s a copyright?&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sage:&lt;/strong&gt; Whenever someone creates something, they own the &amp;ldquo;right&amp;rdquo; to it.&amp;nbsp; Like if you write a poem, it&amp;rsquo;s yours.&amp;nbsp; No one else can say they wrote it, because you wrote it.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lori:&lt;/strong&gt; I get it.&amp;nbsp; So the survey that Brian wants us to use belongs to its owner.&amp;nbsp; Right?&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sage:&lt;/strong&gt; Right!&amp;nbsp; The way I see it, we have several options.&amp;nbsp; We could buy the survey; ask for permission to copy the survey; or develop our own!&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brian:&lt;/strong&gt; Gee guys, I didn&amp;rsquo;t mean to get us in trouble.&amp;nbsp; I just thought the survey would be a good way to get student attention in class&amp;mdash;and a good grade!&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jose:&lt;/strong&gt; No worries Brian.&amp;nbsp; It is a good idea!&amp;nbsp; We just can&amp;rsquo;t use THAT survey.&amp;nbsp; Let&amp;rsquo;s make our own!&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sage, Lori, Deena, Brian:&lt;/strong&gt; OK, let&amp;rsquo;s do!&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;Copyright&lt;/strong&gt; gives the creator of an original creative work the &lt;strong&gt;exclusive right to control who can make copies&lt;/strong&gt; of it, or make works derived from it &lt;a class="ext" href="https://cms.psu.edu/section/content/default.asp?WCI=GOTO&amp;Preview=0&amp;WCU=CRSCNT&amp;Match=Academic+Integrity+References" target="_blank"&gt;(3)&lt;/a&gt;. Even as a student, you have the right to control the use of your original creative projects and papers. Others who use your work must follow fair use guidelines or have your permission to use your work, and make a proper citation in the bibliography.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;More information about copyright: &lt;a class="ext" href="http://www.templetons.com/brad/copymyths.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.templetons.com/brad/copymyths.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;h2&gt;How Are Copyright Laws, Plagiarism, and Academic Integrity Related?&lt;/h2&gt;
		&lt;blockquote&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;If you take someone else&amp;#39;s work and put your name on it so others will think it is your original work, you are committing &lt;strong&gt;plagiarism&lt;/strong&gt;, even if you paid for a legal copy of the materials. In addition, you are limited in the amount and nature of someone else&amp;#39;s work you can use for presentations, projects, papers, and reports without asking for their permission, even when you give credit to the work&amp;#39;s author/owner. &lt;strong&gt;Using more of someone else&amp;#39;s work than &quot;fair use&quot; allows, without their permission, is a violation of copyright laws.&lt;/strong&gt; It is possible to violate copyright laws without committing plagiarism and to commit plagiarism without violating the copyright laws, but both situations would be considered acts of academic dishonesty under Penn State&amp;#39;s Academic Integrity policy.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/blockquote&gt;
		&lt;h2&gt;What is Fair Use?&lt;/h2&gt;
		&lt;blockquote&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;Fair use&quot;&lt;/strong&gt; is a set of guidelines within the copyright law that &lt;em&gt;allows for the limited use of copyrighted works&lt;/em&gt; without first obtaining the permission of the author or owner. These fair use guidelines make it possible for you to use parts of published works in projects, research papers, and reports you write for classes without violating copyright laws.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/blockquote&gt;
		&lt;h3&gt;How can I tell if use of a copyrighted work is fair?&lt;/h3&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;When evaluating a particular use of copyrighted materials consider the following four factors, and ask yourself the following questions &lt;a class="ext" href="https://cms.psu.edu/section/content/default.asp?WCI=GOTO&amp;Preview=0&amp;WCU=CRSCNT&amp;Match=Academic+Integrity+References" target="_blank"&gt;(4)&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;1. The purpose and character of the use:&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;ul&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;Does the new work transform the original work or offer something beyond the original? Copyrighted works that are altered significantly are more likely to be considered fair use.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;Is the use for nonprofit or educational purposes? Copyrighted works used for nonprofit or educational purposes are more likely to be considered fair use.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ul&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;2. The nature of the copyrighted work:&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;ul&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;Is the copyrighted work published or unpublished? Use of published works are more likely to be considered fair use.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;Is the original work out of print? Use of out of print works are more likely to be considered fair use.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;Is the copyrighted work factual or creative? Use of factual works are more likely to be considered fair use.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ul&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;3. The amount and significance of the portion used in relation to the work as a whole:&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;ul&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;Is the amount of the original work used reasonable? The smaller the percentage of the work used, the more likely it is to qualify as fair use.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;Is the section of the original work used the most important part of the work? The less significant the portion of the work used, the more likely it is to be considered fair use.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ul&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;4. The effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the work:&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;ul&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;Does the new work appeal to the same audience as the original work? Copyrighted works that are used for another purpose or designed to appeal to a different audience are more likely to be considered fair use.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ul&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Even if something you use in a project, paper, or report qualifies as fair use, you still have to cite the source of the work to avoid committing plagiarism.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;h2&gt;Fair Use Guidelines for Multimedia Projects &lt;a class="ext" href="https://cms.psu.edu/section/content/default.asp?WCI=GOTO&amp;Preview=0&amp;WCU=CRSCNT&amp;Match=Academic+Integrity+References" target="_blank"&gt;(5)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
		&lt;h5&gt;Allowed Uses&lt;/h5&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Many students like to make use of various forms of media like images, recorded portions of television programs, digitized sound files, etc. in their projects and presentations. The Fair Use Guidelines For Educational Multimedia allow students who create educational multimedia projects containing copyrighted materials to use their projects for&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;ul&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;educational uses in the course for which they were created.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;portfolios as examples of their academic work.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;personal uses such as job and graduate school interviews.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ul&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Students who create multimedia projects and follow the fair use guidelines do not have to request permission to retain a copy of their materials for their personal portfolio after completing their class or presentation. The guidelines require that all multimedia projects that include copyrighted materials:&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;ul&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;credit the sources, display the copyright notice, and provide copyright ownership information. (The credit identifies the source of the work, including the author, title, publisher, and place and date of publication. The copyright ownership information includes the copyright notice, year of first publication, and name of the copyright holder.)&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;state on the opening screen and on any accompanying print material a notice that certain materials are included under the fair use exemption of the U.S. Copyright Law and have been prepared according to the multimedia fair use guidelines and are restricted from further use.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;clearly mark the materials as a student project with the specific class, date of the presentation or project, and complete university information.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;do not contain materials that have been altered or separated from original content for reuse.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ul&gt;
		&lt;h3&gt;Storage&lt;/h3&gt;
		&lt;ul&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;The fair use guidelines place restrictions on how the completed multimedia projects may be retained and stored.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;No more than two copies of a project may be made. One copy may be retained by the creator; the other must be held in the school&amp;#39;s library or media center.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;Students may not make their own copies of copyrighted instructional materials used by instructors in class.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;Projects cannot be replicated or distributed for any purpose other than those listed in the guidelines without obtaining permission from all copyright owners.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ul&gt;
		&lt;h3&gt;Amount of Work You May Use&lt;/h3&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;The guidelines also limit the amount of copyrighted multimedia material that can be included in educational projects to&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;ul&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;up to three minutes or 10 percent, whichever is less, of a single copyrighted motion media work.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;up to 10 percent or 1,000 words, whichever is less, of a single copyrighted work of text.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;an entire poem of less than 250 words or up to 250 words of a longer poem but no more than three poems by one poet or five poems by different poets from a single anthology.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;up to 30 seconds or 10 percent, whichever is less, of music and lyrics from a single musical work.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;up to five photographs or illustrations by one person and no more than 15 images or 10 percent, whichever is less, of the photographs or illustrations from a single published work.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;up to 2,500 fields or cell entries or 10 percent, whichever is less, from a numerical database or data table.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ul&gt;
		&lt;h3&gt;A Note on Digital Media&lt;/h3&gt;
		&lt;blockquote&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;The opportunities for inappropriate copying and use of copyrighted electronic material extend into media other than just text, including audio, video, graphics files, and even data sets. Even though digital files are readily available on the Internet, in most cases, you must still have&lt;b&gt; written permission before downloading or electronically copying &lt;/b&gt; and using someone else&amp;#39;s electronic files (including music) for anything other than a project or presentation for a class. Also, when copying digital files, just as when copying any material, you must be very careful to follow the fair use guidelines as previously discussed.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Some Web sites may have a page listing circumstances in which a file could be downloaded and used (e.g. &quot; for educational or non-commercial uses&quot;). In these instances you may not have to follow fair use guidelines, but you still must give credit for the work by citing the author and/or Web site if you are using the materials for a project or paper. If you cannot determine whether your use of electronic materials is allowed, it is better to just not use them and create or find something else to use instead.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/ul&gt;
		&lt;h2&gt;What is a Public Domain Work?&lt;/h2&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;A public domain work is a creative work that is not protected by copyright and which may be freely used by everyone. Creative works are placed in the public domain when:&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;ol&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;the term of copyright for the work has expired;&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;the author failed to satisfy requirements to maintain the copyright or&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;the work is a work of the U.S. Government.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ol&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Even if something that you use in a project, paper, or report is in the public domain, you still have to cite the source and author of the work to avoid committing plagiarism.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;h6&gt;More Information&lt;/h6&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="ext" href="http://www.unc.edu/%7Eunclng/public-d.htm" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.unc.edu/~unclng/public-d.htm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;h2&gt;How do you know which Web resources you are allowed to use? &lt;a class="ext" href="https://cms.psu.edu/section/content/default.asp?WCI=GOTO&amp;Preview=0&amp;WCU=CRSCNT&amp;Match=Academic+Integrity+References" target="_blank"&gt;(6)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;As a general rule, a good way to determine whether a Web site is copyright protected or in the public domain is to relate it as closely as possible to a print resource. Publications created by the U.S. government are in the public domain, for example, so information provided at U.S. government Web sites is also in the public domain.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Not every Internet resource can be related to a corresponding print resource, however. Erroneously posting copyrighted material to your own Web site carries even greater risks than innocently using copyrighted material in your class work. If you plan to post work you have not created to your Web site, you should avoid:&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;ul&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;copying and posting links that contain descriptions of the linked sites, although posting links that contain only a URL and the title of the site is generally acceptable.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;downloading graphics, including bullets, logos, fonts, photographs, and illustrations.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;framing information from another site, particularly if you delete the site&amp;#39;s ads or identifying information or make it look as if the information is your own.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;deep-linking to an interior page of a site. Bypassing advertising or identifying information on a site&amp;#39;s main page may deprive the copyright owner of revenue.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;copying a site&amp;#39;s html code.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ul&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;You also should keep in mind that works posted on other sites might not have been posted by the copyright owner or with the copyright owner&amp;#39;s permission. Just because a copyrighted work is already posted on the Web doesn&amp;#39;t mean it&amp;#39;s there legally. Even sites that have obtained the required permission may not have the right to transfer that permission to you. Always get permission to use a copyrighted online work from the owner of that work, not from a secondary source. If you plan to use the work online, be sure to get permission to use the work &lt;strong&gt;electronically&lt;/strong&gt;. Print rights and electronic rights are not the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;h3&gt;Activity 3:&lt;/h3&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s see how much you understand about copyright, fair use, and public domain. Determine if each of the situations in &lt;a class="ext" href="https://cms.psu.edu/section/content/Default.asp?WCI=pgDisplay&amp;WCU=CRSCNT&amp;ENTRY_ID=11AC28033E3A4FFA92DCBC81398DD1AF" target="_blank"&gt;this quick quiz&lt;/a&gt; constitutes a violation of copyright laws (true) or not (false).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What is Cheating?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lori:&lt;/strong&gt; Hey guys, haven&amp;rsquo;t seen you since the semester started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brian, Sage, Deena, Jose:&lt;/strong&gt; Hi Lori!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brian:&lt;/strong&gt; How&amp;rsquo;s your second semester going?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lori:&lt;/strong&gt; It&amp;rsquo;s going OK.&amp;nbsp; Just trying to keep up with all my assignments. How about yours?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brian:&lt;/strong&gt; It&amp;rsquo;s OK.&amp;nbsp; I&amp;rsquo;m having some trouble keeping up in math class, but I&amp;rsquo;ve got a friend who is going to help me out, so I think I&amp;rsquo;ll pass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jose:&lt;/strong&gt; How is this friend going to help you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brian:&lt;/strong&gt; Well, he already had the class, so I&amp;rsquo;m just going to use his homework and change the answers some.&amp;nbsp; It&amp;rsquo;s not like I&amp;rsquo;m not going to study, because I&amp;rsquo;m studying his notes!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sage: &lt;/strong&gt;Whoa there, Brian. Isn&amp;rsquo;t that a violation of the academic integrity policy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deena:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah Brian. I&amp;rsquo;d be careful if I were you.&amp;nbsp; I think that is called cheating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brian: &lt;/strong&gt;You serious?&amp;nbsp; I&amp;rsquo;m studying, so why is it cheating?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jose: &lt;/strong&gt;Way serious man.&amp;nbsp; It&amp;rsquo;s cheating because you plan to turn in homework someone else did and pretend you did it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brian:&lt;/strong&gt; But I studied and I made some changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lori:&lt;/strong&gt; Get real, Brian.&amp;nbsp; You know that&amp;rsquo;s cheating.&amp;nbsp; Why don&amp;rsquo;t you let us help you study instead of using your friend&amp;#39;s homework?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jose:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, I&amp;#39;ve already had that math class. I can help you understand the problems better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deena:&lt;/strong&gt; You could also go to the Learning Center for help. They have math tutors there who can help you. That&amp;#39;s where I went for help with my math course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brian:&lt;/strong&gt; I guess I could do that. I never really thought about what I was doing as cheating.&amp;nbsp; I certainly don&amp;rsquo;t want to be considered a cheat, nor do I want to get caught cheating!&amp;nbsp; Thanks for setting me straight guys!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jose:&lt;/strong&gt; Even if you get a lower grade, it&amp;#39;s better than knowing that you only got a good grade because you cheated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Academic cheating is anything you do to make it appear that someone else&amp;#39;s work is your own, or allowing someone else to copy your work and submit it as their own. It can include sharing another person&amp;#39;s work, copying answers on an exam or homework assignment, buying a research or creative paper, paying someone else to do your work for you, obtaining copies of exams, homework assignments, and notes and using them in place of doing your own work, etc. When grade, rather than education, become the focus, students become more willing to do whatever it takes to get an &quot;A.&quot; Although some acts of cheating are unintentional -- the student doesn&amp;#39;t realize what he is doing is considered cheating -- most of the time students know when they are doing something wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is Plagiarism?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jose:&lt;/strong&gt; Did you hear what happened to that guy in our composition class?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brian:&lt;/strong&gt; No, what guy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jose:&lt;/strong&gt; Phil. The guy that always leaves class early.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brian:&lt;/strong&gt; Oh yeah, him.&amp;nbsp; What happened?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jose:&lt;/strong&gt; He got caught plagiarizing and is in big trouble!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sage:&lt;/strong&gt; Hey guys, what&amp;rsquo;s up?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jose:&lt;/strong&gt; Hey Sage.&amp;nbsp; I was just telling Brian about Phil getting caught plagiarizing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sage:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah.&amp;nbsp; That was tough man.&amp;nbsp; But he should have known better.&amp;nbsp; Google and Turnitin.com make it easy for faculty to catch students who steal the work of others -- especially if they just copy and paste it from the Web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brian:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, I know. But this worries me some.&amp;nbsp; What if Phil didn&amp;rsquo;t mean to plagiarize?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sage:&lt;/strong&gt; Well, if he didn&amp;rsquo;t mean to, then he can discuss that with his professor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deena:&lt;/strong&gt; Hi, guys.&amp;nbsp; I heard you talking about plagiarism. I&amp;rsquo;ve always been confused about the difference between plagiarism and cheating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jose:&lt;/strong&gt; Well, first, plagiarism is a form of cheating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sage:&lt;/strong&gt; That&amp;rsquo;s right. The way I understand it, plagiarism is when someone copies or uses somebody else&amp;rsquo;s work and acts like it is theirs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brian:&lt;/strong&gt; OK.&amp;nbsp; That&amp;rsquo;s pretty clear. So if you copy something, you should give the author credit for it.&amp;nbsp; But I still don&amp;rsquo;t see how professors would know when someone has plagiarized the work of others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sage:&lt;/strong&gt; Well, most professors can tell when you&amp;rsquo;ve used the work of some author in their particular field. Plus, they can use resources on the Web like Google and Turnitin.com to see if the text in your paper came from a Web site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brian:&lt;/strong&gt; Turnitin.com?&amp;nbsp; What&amp;rsquo;s that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sage:&lt;/strong&gt; Well, it&amp;rsquo;s a computer database that professors can use to check student papers for plagiarism.&amp;nbsp; What they do is, they submit the paper and the database checks it against millions of documents and sends the professor back a report listing any text that is not original. Then the professor can go through each of the instances that Turnitin has found and verify whether or not they are properly cited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brian:&lt;/strong&gt; Wow, that&amp;rsquo;s pretty high-tech!&amp;nbsp; Guess we all better be careful not to copy and paste when we write our papers!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jose:&lt;/strong&gt; Instructors also keep papers from previous semesters and previous assignments. Even if you copy something that can&amp;#39;t be checked by Google or Turnitin because it isn&amp;#39;t on the Web, instructors tend to remember what other students have written and can check through their inventory of student papers to see if the paper you are handing in has been copied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deena:&lt;/strong&gt; It&amp;#39;s also important to make sure you cite the work correctly if you do copy and paste. In addition to giving the author credit, you also need to format the text correctly by indenting it and putting it in quotes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brian:&lt;/strong&gt; My instructor told us to use the &lt;em&gt;Chicago Manual of Style&lt;/em&gt; when citing sources in our papers. The style guide covers how to format and cite the text when you are copying and pasting exact text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deena:&lt;/strong&gt; At any rate, learning how to write a paper and correctly cite sources are important skills to have. Isn&amp;#39;t that why we&amp;#39;re here in the first place? To learn?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Like cheating,&lt;em&gt; plagiarism &lt;/em&gt;is also implying that another person&amp;#39;s work is your own. Plagiarism is a form of cheating. You commit plagiarism if you:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;submit a paper you have not written to be graded or reviewed as your original work.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;copy answers or text from another classmate and submit them as your own.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;quote or paraphrase from another paper, a book, a journal article, or a webpage without using quotation marks, indenting the block of text, and crediting the original author.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;use long pieces of text or unique phrasings without using quotation marks, indenting the block of text, and acknowledging the original source.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;cite data without crediting the original source.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;propose another author&amp;#39;s idea as if it were your own.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;present another author&amp;#39;s structure or sequence of ideas as your own without giving the original author credit.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;fabricate references or use incorrect references.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;submit someone else&amp;#39;s computer program or spreadsheet with minor alterations as your own work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not a definitive list - any action which implies that someone else&amp;#39;s work is your own can be considered plagiarism. However, things like studying in groups and copying a classmate&amp;#39;s notes from classes you may have missed are not necessarily acts of plagiarism or cheating. These are things your instructor should address when giving an assignment. If you have any questions about whether working together and sharing notes is OK or not, ask your instructor. It is better to ask for clarification before you start than to have to defend your actions later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following Web sites provide examples of the different types of plagiarism. Pay attention to the fact that avoiding plagiarism is not as simple as not &quot;cutting and pasting&quot; from other documents:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the boundaries between research and plagiarism can be ambiguous. The &lt;a class="ext" href="http://owl.english.purdue.edu/handouts/research/r_plagiar.html" target="_blank"&gt;OWL Avoiding Plagiarism&lt;/a&gt; Web site has a good discussion on the boundary between using other people&amp;#39;s research and plagiarism. &lt;a class="ext" href="https://cms.psu.edu/section/content/default.asp?WCI=GOTO&amp;Preview=0&amp;WCU=CRSCNT&amp;Match=Academic+Integrity+References" target="_blank"&gt;(1)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why Plagiarism and Cheating are Wrong&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Penn State is an institution of both learning and research. When you cheat and commit plagiarism, not only do you break the law, you hurt yourself and the community in the following ways &lt;a class="ext" href="https://cms.psu.edu/section/content/default.asp?WCI=GOTO&amp;Preview=0&amp;WCU=CRSCNT&amp;Match=Academic+Integrity+References" target="_blank"&gt;(1)&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;You deny yourself the opportunity to learn and practice skills that may be needed in your future careers. You also deny yourself the opportunity to receive honest feedback on how to improve your skills and performance.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;You invite future employers and faculty to question your integrity and performance in general.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;You damage Penn State&amp;#39;s reputation and invite others to question the integrity of Penn State and the value and validity of degrees issued by Penn State.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;You commit fraud on faculty who are evaluating your work.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;You deprive another author due credit for his or her work.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;You show disrespect for your peers who have done their own work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Unintentional Plagiarism -- How to Properly Cite a Reference&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Like cheating, some acts of plagiarism are unintentional -- the student simply doesn&amp;#39;t realize that what he is doing is wrong. One of the most common errors is not citing sources used for an assignment.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When do you need to cite your sources? The short answer is that you should cite a source any time you incorporate into a project, report, or paper an idea, quote (written or spoken), data, image, or other content that is not yours no matter where it came from, unless it is common knowledge.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The term &lt;em&gt;common knowledge&lt;/em&gt; refers to any knowledge that you can reasonably expect other people to know. For instance, the fact that there are bilingual speakers in the United State &lt;strong&gt;is common knowledge&lt;/strong&gt;. You would not have to cite any sources.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The specific percentages or numbers of bilingual speakers would &lt;strong&gt;not be common knowledge.&lt;/strong&gt; If you were using any graphs or numbers about how many bilingual speakers are in the United States, you would need to cite where you obtained the information. If someone, like a professor, told you the information in person or via e-mail, you can cite it as a &quot;personal communication.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;There are several citation standards such as MLA, APA, &lt;em&gt;Chicago Manual of Style&lt;/em&gt; and more. Links to several &lt;b&gt;common style guides&lt;/b&gt; are available from the Penn State library&amp;nbsp; &quot;Writing Resources/Style Manuals&quot; &lt;a class="ext" href="http://www.libraries.psu.edu/psul/researchguides/matbytype/citationstyles/stylemanuals.html" target="_blank"&gt;www.libraries.psu.edu/psul/researchguides/matbytype/citationstyles/stylemanuals.html&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;However, you should always follow whichever citation or bibliography format your instructor gives you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

	&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Excuses Students Give for Academic Dishonesty&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Activity 4:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By now you should have read the materials on cheating, plagiarism, copyright, and fair use. Think about your past experiences as a student. Have you ever done anything academically dishonest? Intentionally? Unintentionally? Did you try to rationalize what you were doing with an excuse?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;You may think you have a good excuse for academic dishonesty, but you should think again. &lt;a class="ext" href="https://cms.psu.edu/section/content/default.asp?WCI=GOTO&amp;Preview=0&amp;WCU=CRSCNT&amp;Match=Academic+Integrity+References" target="_blank"&gt;(2)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;I. &quot;I&amp;#39;m too busy.&quot;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Maybe you think you have too many credits or are working too many hours to be able to complete your assignments. However, it is your responsibility to make sure you have scheduled adequate time to complete all your assignments.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;If you discover that you do not have enough time to complete an assignment, it is far better to discuss your situation with your instructor or TA than to commit plagiarism.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The worst that can happen to you in this situation, is that you fail the class and have to retake it. While failing a class is embarrassing and retaking it is inconvenient, it is not as bad as being found guilty of academic dishonesty and &lt;strong&gt;receiving sanctions &lt;/strong&gt;(see below).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;II. &quot;My work isn&amp;#39;t good enough.&quot;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Maybe you feel that the quality of your work is so poor that you could never pass the class. Faculty do not expect your work to be 100% perfect. The purpose of any assignment is for you to learn and practice new skills.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;If you feel your skills are especially weak, it is far better for you to discuss your concerns with your instructor. He or she may be able to point you to resources that can help you improve your grade.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Remember, it is always better to fail honestly than to be found guilty of academic dishonesty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;III. &quot;Everyone else is doing it. I have to do it to just to keep up.&quot;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;More than half of all Penn State students admit to cheating at some point in their college career. Students who don&amp;#39;t cheat feel like they are put at an unfair disadvantage by students who do cheat. However, there is no evidence to show that students who cheat receive higher grades than those who don&amp;#39;t cheat, nor is there any evidence to show they are hired for better jobs. In addition, the consequences of getting caught cheating far outweigh any momentary gains. It&amp;#39;s better to fail a course and have to repeat it than to be found guilty of academic dishonesty and have a mark on your transcript for the rest of your life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;IV. &quot;I need to cheat in order to have a high G.P.A.&quot;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Some students honestly feel that the only way to a high G.P.A. is through cheating, but that simply is not true. Students have achieved high G.P.A.&amp;#39;s without cheating, and, in fact, a Penn State Pulse survey and other studies have shown that students who cheat tend to have lower G.P.A.&amp;#39;s than students who do not cheat.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Ask yourself this: Would you want a doctor who passed his or her courses only because of cheating?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;V. &quot;I didn&amp;#39;t know it was academic dishonesty.&quot;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;It is&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; your responsibility&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; as a Penn State student to know what constitutes academic dishonesty. That&amp;#39;s what this module is all about.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;If you find that you are in a situation where you are not sure if your work could be construed as cheating, ask your instructor or look for examples of what not to do. Some sources of examples are provided earlier in this module and your department or college may have examples related specifically to that field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;VI. &quot;They&amp;#39;ll never find out.&quot;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Just because your instructors are busy faculty and TA&amp;#39;s does not mean they are unaware. Many faculty are aware of online &quot;paper mill&quot; Web sites and have also seen enough other assignments to know if something looks &quot;too familiar&quot; or &quot;doesn&amp;#39;t seem right.&quot; In addition, educators are developing and using technologies which can look for similar phrases across papers. Penn State is now a member of &quot;Turnitin.com,&quot; a resource that allows faculty to check papers against a vast database of information for occurrences of plagiarism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;VII. &quot;I meant to include citations, but I forgot/ran out of time.&quot;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Get into the habit of inserting citations, even in your rough drafts. Using index cards for source information is one way you can keep track of your references, other methods are equally successful. If you don&amp;#39;t know which citation to use, put some question marks in the draft and track it down later.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;If you need to review citation guidelines, you can access the &lt;a class="ext" href="http://www.libraries.psu.edu/psul/researchguides/matbytype/citationstyles.html" target="_blank"&gt;Penn State Library Citation Styles&lt;/a&gt; or explore the information and links in &quot;&lt;a class="ext" href="https://cms.psu.edu/section/content/default.asp?WCI=GOTO&amp;Preview=0&amp;WCU=CRSCNT&amp;Match=Academic+Integrity:+Citing+A+Source" target="_blank"&gt;How to Properly Cite a Source.&lt;/a&gt;&quot; There are many citation styles, so you should ask your instructor which one is appropriat for a particular class if he or she has not indicated a citation style for you to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How You Can Avoid Situations That Lead to Academic Dishonesty&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, upholding your personal academic integrity is &lt;strong&gt;your responsibility&lt;/strong&gt; as a member of the university community, so &lt;strong&gt;plan ahead&lt;/strong&gt; and make sure you understand your assignments and where you can go for help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be proactive.&lt;/strong&gt; If you don&amp;#39;t understand an assignment or are unclear about your instructor&amp;#39;s expectations, ask &lt;strong&gt;early in the semester&lt;/strong&gt;. Don&amp;#39;t wait until the last minute!&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Plan ahead.&lt;/strong&gt; Look at the work load for all of your courses. When are your assignments due? How much work will each take? What can you start on right away? Will you need to learn a new citation style or method of research for any of these assignments?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Know where to find information and resources.&lt;/strong&gt;
		&lt;ul&gt;

		&lt;/ul&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Consequences for Academic Integrity Violations at Penn State&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;There is a &lt;a class="ext" href="http://www.psu.edu/dept/oue/aappm/G-9.html" target="_blank"&gt;University policy known as G-9&lt;/a&gt; which provides direction for responding to academic integrity violations of the University&amp;#39;s code of conduct. In addition, each college and campus have designed specific guidelines for responding to allegations and have the authority to impose sanctions on students who violate the academic integrity policy. Faculty members are responsible for conveying the allegation and sanction to the student, who can then choose to accept the charge and sanction or appeal to the College (or campus) academic integrity committee for a review or hearing. The outcome of that review or hearing is final and cannot be appealed. When disciplinary sanctions are recommended, the case will be managed by the &lt;a class="ext" href="http://www.sa.psu.edu/ja/" target="_blank"&gt;Office of Judicial Affairs&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a class="ext" href="http://www.sa.psu.edu/ja/" target="_blank" title="www.sa.psu.edu/ja/"&gt;www.sa.psu.edu/ja/&lt;/a&gt;) or a Judicial Affairs designee.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The outcome of all academic integrity cases is sent to the Office of Judicial Affairs or the Judicial Affairs designee for record-keeping.&amp;nbsp; When a student is found responsible for a violation, the student&amp;#39;s previous academic integrity history will be viewed and a more serious sanction could be assigned as a result of repeated misconduct.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;In Fall 2000, Penn State instituted the &lt;a class="ext" href="http://www.psu.edu/dept/oue/aappm/G-9.html" target="_blank"&gt;XF grade&lt;/a&gt;, which is a disciplinary sanction assigned to students found responsible for committing extreme acts of academic dishonesty. The XF grade will appear on the student&amp;#39;s official transcript and states that the student&amp;#39;s grade was assigned specifically because he or she&lt;strong&gt; committed an act of academic dishonesty.&lt;/strong&gt; For the 2001-2002 school year, &lt;a class="ext" href="http://www.collegian.psu.edu/archive/2003/01/01-20-03tdc/01-20-03dnews-02.asp" target="_blank"&gt;268 cases of academic dishonesty&lt;/a&gt; were reported, resulting in various penalties including five XF grades and several dismissals from academic programs.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;In addition to the XF grade, there are a number of other sanctions that could be imposed when a student is found responsible for academic dishonesty, including warnings, letter grade reductions, and/or disciplinary sanctions such as probation or expulsion.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Many colleges and campuses at Penn State have their own policy statements on academic integrity which are based on the University-wide policy, 49-20. Here are links to some of them &lt;a class="ext" href="https://cms.psu.edu/section/content/default.asp?WCI=GOTO&amp;Preview=0&amp;WCU=CRSCNT&amp;Match=Academic+Integrity+References" target="_blank"&gt;(2)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Code of Mutual Respect and Cooperation</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;The Eberly College of Science Code of Mutual Respect and Cooperation pertains to all members of the college community; faculty, staff, and students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a class="ext" href="http://www.science.psu.edu/climate/Code-of-Mutual-Respect%20final.pdf" target="_blank" title="Code of Mutual Respect and Cooperation"&gt;Code of Mutual Respect and Cooperation&lt;/a&gt; was developed to embody the values that we hope our faculty, staff, and students possess, consistent with the aspirational goals expressed in the Penn State Principles. The University is strongly committed to freedom of expression, and consequently, the Code does not constitute University or College policy, and is not intended to interfere in any way with an individual&amp;rsquo;s academic or personal freedoms. We hope, however, that individuals will voluntarily endorse the 12 principles set forth in the Code, thereby helping us make the Eberly College of Science a place where every individual feels respected and valued, as well as challenged and rewarded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;The 12 Principles of the Code are:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Treat everyone equally and with respect&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Be courteous&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Be ready to communicate&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Encourage others and share your expertise with them&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Give and accept constructive criticism&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Be receptive to change&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Be a team player&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Get involved&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Have a positive attitude&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Be honest and accept responsibility&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Recognize other people&amp;rsquo;s priorities&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Strive to do your best&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;</body>

    <title>Help!</title>
    <body>&lt;div class="art-postcontent"&gt;
	&lt;div class="art-article"&gt;
		&lt;h2&gt;Sometimes questions arise as to who to contact about a certain issue and where.&amp;nbsp; Use the information below to guide you in seeking answers to your questions.&lt;/h2&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;For general questions about the course content and activities...&lt;/h4&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions about the course content or activities, at any point in the course, please post them to our &lt;em&gt;Questions?&lt;/em&gt; discussion forum (instead of using private e-mail), located under the &lt;tt&gt;Communicate&lt;/tt&gt; tab in ANGEL. That way everyone can benefit from seeing the question and the answer! I will check that discussion forum at least once per day, Monday through Friday, to respond. While you are there, feel free to post your own responses if you, too, are able to help out a classmate!&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;For questions of a personal nature...&lt;/h4&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;If you have a question that you would prefer not to share with the rest of the class, such as about your grade, you are welcome to contact me by email, via ANGEL, anytime. I usually am able to respond within 24 hours. Although e-mail correspondence is preferred, students may also contact me by telephone (see our syllabus for contact information) from 9.00 a.m. to 5.00 p.m. EST, Monday through Friday. You should expect that all messages will be received and answered within 24 hours, but in rare cases it may take me longer to get back to you.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;For technical issues related to this website...&lt;/h4&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Please contact&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;For technical questions related to ANGEL...&lt;/h4&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;If you experience technology problems of any kind (course Web site, ANGEL), please report them to ANGEL Support, preferably AT THE EXACT MOMENT that they occur.&amp;nbsp; That way the &lt;a class="ext" href="http://angelkb.ais.psu.edu/article.asp?article=1417&amp;p=2" target="_blank"&gt;ANGEL Support&lt;/a&gt; team will be able to validate glitches and fix system problems as they occur.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;It is in your own best interest to be as specific as you possibly can. Vague descriptions of a problem only delay assistance. Try to include information such as:&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;ul&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;Indicate the specific course page, quiz question, etc. you were on, what you attempted to do when that failed, and &lt;strong&gt;the exact language of any error message&lt;/strong&gt; displayed on your screen&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;The date and time when your problem occurred&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;Any other pertinent information (does the problem happen consistently and always in the same way, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ul&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;A member of ANGEL support will be in contact with you to assist you.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Principles of Scientific Writing</title>
    <body>&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;Use these guidelines whenever you are preparing a scientific document. Conciseness is just as important as completeness and accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Avoid the use of pronouns: I, you, he, she, they, them, our, your, it, and so forth.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Write in complete sentences.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Paginate&amp;nbsp;your work, even if it consists of a single page.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Be sure to put your name in the page header or footer, starting with page 2.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Express temperature in degrees Celsius rather than degrees Fahrenheit.&amp;nbsp; For example, the normal temperature of the human body is 37&amp;deg;, not 98.6&amp;deg;.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Be certain to cite the source of any data or idea that is not your own.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Do not repeat the same idea. Write it once, and then move onto the next thought.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Be concise and to the point. Scientific writing is not an exercise in creative writing. Also, be sure your work is free of &amp;ldquo;science fiction.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Be sure to check your written work for typographical and grammatical errors before handing it in. Nothing detracts from the quality of written work like errors in spelling, punctuation, and sentence structure.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Consider having someone proofread your paper before submitting it. Often, another set of eyes can detect problems that may have been missed due to fatigue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;</body>

    <title>Penn State Libraries</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;Just like on-campus students, as a Penn State student you have a wealth of library resources available to you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a &lt;em&gt;registered &lt;/em&gt;user of Penn State Libraries, you can...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;search for journal articles (many are even immediately available in full-text)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;request articles that aren&amp;#39;t available in full-text and have them delivered electronically&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;borrow books and other materials and have them delivered to your doorstep&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;access materials that your instructor has put on electronic Library Reserves&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;talk to reference librarians in real time using chat, phone, and e-mail&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;...and much more!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Activity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that we can be sure you are able to take advantage of Library resources in this course, follow these steps NOW:&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lesson 01: Introduction</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;We live in a technology-driven world and it would be hard to imagine a world without cell phones, i‐pods, antibiotics, a criminal justice system, and food on our tables, just to name a few. You only need to open a newspaper, or turn on the TV and you will be inundated with topics such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Climate change&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Species extinction&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Nutrition and health&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Pandemics&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Cloning&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Stem cells&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Mod1 Less1 headlines.png" src="assets/Mod1%20Less1%20headlines.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet a recent Pew and AAAS survey report that only 52% of Americans know the difference between stem cells and normal cells, and despite 84% of scientists believing that human emissions are causing global warming, only 49% of the general American public think the same.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Many of us don&amp;#39;t value science as much as we should. However, science lives beneath the surface of everything we touch and taste. It is the key to our prosperity, one of the driving forces of our economy, and it creates hundreds of thousands of jobs.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Despite the fact that science is, and will continue to be, part of our daily lives, statistics from Michigan State University report that in 2007 only 28% of American adults qualify as scientifically literate.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Module 1 Topics and Checklist&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Module 1 will cover the following topics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Examples of science in contemporary life&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Explanation of what this laboratory portion of the course will cover&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;How to use Google Docs and VoiceThread for this course&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Explanation of how the course will work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</body>

    <title>Lesson 02: Why is Science Important?</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;Curiosity and casual observation can only get you so far in today&amp;#39;s fast-paced world where there are a number of issues that require some understanding of science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watch this short video to learn why science is so important today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Contrary to popular belief, science is not a list of facts to be remembered, but rather it is an intellectual activity that encompasses observation, description, experimentation, and explanation of phenomena. In other words, science is a pathway to discover and better understand the world around us.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <title>Lesson 04: What are we Going to Do in this Part of the Course?</title>
    <body>&lt;div&gt;Scientific thinking is an important element in the study of a wide range of topics--from economics, through health, to the environment. We will focus on biology (or the study of living things), and using real‐world examples we will develop a new level of biological literacy.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Biological literacy is the ability to:&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;ul&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;Use the method of scientific inquiry to think creatively about real‐world biological (e.g. health and environment) issues.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;Integrate these ideas into decision-making processes.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Biological issues such as obesity, stem cell research, genetically modified crops, swine flu, fossil fuel use, and global warming appear frequently in the news, and as such, they have become politically charged subjects. An enhanced biological literacy level should help you to make wiser, more informed decisions for yourself, and ultimately, for society at large.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Science is an integral part of technology, and where this course probably differs from other courses, is that we are using and integrating new web-based technologies to enhance the learning environment. In doing so, this course is:&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;ul&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;Contemporary - integrates real-world issues into the course content.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;Flexible - it is online so you can manage your own time and decide when and where you want to learn.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;Multidisciplinary - while we are focusing on biology, many of the skills learned will be directly transferable to other disciplines (science or non-science).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, you will be developing digital literacy skills that will be beneficial in your future post-university years.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <title>Lesson 05: Using Google Docs</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;We will be using Google Docs and Spreadsheets throughout this course. Specifically, you will use Google Spreadsheets to perform data calculations and graphing and use Google Docs to record your information and then later submit for grading via the ANGEL drop-box feature. These assignments begin in Module 4, however we have &lt;b&gt;a required assessment in this module&lt;/b&gt; where you will practice using Google Docs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watch this Video tutorial - Google Docs in Plain English - for more clarification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" scrolling="no" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/eRqUE6IHTEA" width="420"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open the &lt;a assets/googledocsinplainenglishtranscript.pdf"&gt;transcript of this video&lt;/a&gt; if you would like to read or print the information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The steps below will help you get started with Google Docs so that you can complete the &lt;strong&gt;required assessment&lt;/strong&gt; for Module 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Steps to create a Google account:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Step 1: Create Your Google Account Now&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will need to make sure you have a Google account set up so that you can access course documents. If you do not already have a Google account, go to &lt;a class="ext" href="https://www.google.com/accounts/NewAccount" target="_blank"&gt;Google&amp;#39;s signup webpage&lt;/a&gt; to open one. &lt;strong&gt;Note: &lt;/strong&gt;you do not need a &quot;Gmail&quot; account, just a &quot;Google&quot; account with your regular email address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watch this Video tutorial - Using Google Docs without a Gmail account - for more clarification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/gJpkRbNto7E" width="420"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open the &lt;a assets/usinggoogledocswithoutagmailaccounttranscript.pdf"&gt;transcript of this video&lt;/a&gt; if you would like to read or print the information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Step 2: Become familiar with Google Docs&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visit the &lt;a class="ext" href="https://docs.google.com/support/bin/static.py?page=guide.cs&amp;guide=21008" target="_blank"&gt;Getting Started Guide&lt;/a&gt; to become familiar with Google Docs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Step 3: Move onto Lesson 06: VoiceThread.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After you go through Lesson 06&lt;b&gt;,&lt;/b&gt; you will be given instructions to complete the &lt;a class="ext" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cB0aEdFKi4xqj2GTrjO63KA8MRMjo-8JX8ZxOjkAFyQ/edit" target="_blank"&gt;Module 01 Assessment Part 1: Google Docs&lt;/a&gt; which includes using Google Docs.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <title>Lesson 06: Using VoiceThread</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;A VoiceThread is a collaborative, multimedia slide show that holds images, documents, and videos. It allows you to navigate pages and, most importantly, leave comments on any of the media within it. You have already viewed a VoiceThread in Lesson 3, and you will be seeing many more as small instructional pieces throughout the modules. Later on in the course you will get to create your own media and post comments on a VoiceThread of your own. In the meantime, we have &lt;b&gt;a required assessment in this module&lt;/b&gt; where you will practice using VoiceThread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The steps below will help you get started with VoiceThread so that you can complete the &lt;strong&gt;required assessment&lt;/strong&gt; for Module 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Step 1: Become familiar with VoiceThread&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before you get started with VoiceThread, visit the &lt;a class="ext" href="http://voicethread.psu.edu/" target="_blank"&gt;VoiceThread at Penn State&lt;/a&gt; website. There are various resources to help get you started, including &lt;a class="ext" href="http://voicethread.psu.edu/voicethread-at-psu-frequently-asked-questions.html" target="_blank"&gt;frequently asked questions&lt;/a&gt; as well as a VoiceThread&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="ext" href="http://psu.voicethread.com/support/forum/" target="_blank"&gt;forum&lt;/a&gt; for tips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Step 2: Watch a VoiceThread and Leave a Comment&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your first exercise in working with VoiceThread will be to leave a comment on one. To do this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Follow this &quot;&lt;a class="ext" href="http://psu.voicethread.com/share/3151587/" target="_blank"&gt;VoiceThread Link&lt;/a&gt;&quot; to get everything set up for this course.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;After signing in, you should see a message that you have become a member of the group &quot;Biology110_Summer2012_Section001&quot; (your section number).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Next, click the My Voice tab.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Find the&amp;nbsp;VoiceThread titled &quot;&lt;i&gt;Bio110 Mod 1 Assignment -Section###&quot;&lt;/i&gt; and click on it.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Click on the &lt;b&gt;Comment&lt;/b&gt; button and then choose your method of leaving a comment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Listen to the instructor&amp;#39;s comment and then comment with your name, major and any other information you would like to share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Step 3: Learn How to Create Your own VoiceThread&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with being able to make a comment on someone else&amp;#39;s VoiceThread, you will also need to be able to create your own VoiceThread presentation. As part of the assessment for Module 01, you will be asked to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Create your own VoiceThread,&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Upload an image,&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Make a comment and&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Share your VoiceThread with your TA&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please click here for the &lt;a class="ext" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iZvOAFlN465YGcpqS2nhdaAI57upoWdK9_du45Eo_ko/edit" target="_blank"&gt;Module 01 Assessment Part 2: VoiceThread&lt;/a&gt; Google Doc instructions and then submit to &lt;a class="ext" href="https://cms.psu.edu/section/content/Default.asp?WCI=pgDisplay&amp;WCU=CRSCNT&amp;ENTRY_ID=C970FCC0E9214E868D4EFBC735FE5FD8" target="_blank"&gt;Module 01 Assessments Part 1 and 2 - Drop Box&lt;/a&gt; by Friday, July 15th at 11:00PM Eastern Time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Watch How to Create and Share a VoiceThread&lt;/h5&gt;

    <title>Lesson 07: Course Structure and Features</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Learning the process of science cannot be done overnight. Rather, just like a plumber or a carpenter has a toolbox full of the tools needed for their trade to get the job done, we will methodically gather the scientific tools needed to place in our scientific toolbox so that we can better understand the process of science, assess science in the media, and make informed conclusions and decisions based on the information presented.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;The course runs over the session and has the following structure--all of which is accessible through ANGEL:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;ul&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;Module 01: Introduction&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;Module 02: The Scientific Method&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;Module 03: Descriptive Statistics&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;Module 04: Graphs&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;Module 05: Inferential Statistics&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;Module 06: Integration&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;Module 07: Science and Media&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;Module 08: Climate Change&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;Module 09: Pandemics&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;Module 10: Final Assessment- Group Project&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Help&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;As you have read so far, this course will have you working with new learning technologies and you may need some help with them on occasion. You can access the course help page while in any module by selecting the &lt;b&gt;Help&lt;/b&gt; tab.&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Give us your Feedback Anytime&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;You are encouraged to voice your opinions and feedback so that this course can continue to evolve. You are just as integral to this course as the faculty is - so lets have fun and learn together!&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;To provide your feedback at any time during this course, access the &lt;b&gt;Course Feedback&lt;/b&gt; tab and use the short form to submit your comment.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Module 1 Wrap-up&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have just finished Module 1. If you have any questions, please email your TA via ANGEL. Alternatively, if there is anything in this module that you would like to comment on, or add to, please visit the &quot;Course Feedback&quot; link in the top menu.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lesson 01: Introduction</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;If you have ever watched Animal Planet or Discovery Channel, you will be familiar with Sir David Attenborough. He is probably the best-known natural history filmmaker, whose career as a naturalist and broadcaster has spanned nearly five decades. There are very few places on this Earth that he has not visited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have had a brief look at why science is important, but this is what Sir David Attenborough had to say when asked about the importance of science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="480" scrolling="no" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/XAttPMY2KsQ" width="640"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news is that you do not need a science degree to be able to understand science. We as humans have a big brain that enables us to explain how things work by using methodical, objective, and rational observation and analysis--thereby setting us apart from other species such as those that appear in Sir David Attenborough&amp;#39;s movies. &amp;nbsp;However, curiosity and casual observation can only get us so far in today&amp;#39;s fast paced world where there are a number of issues that require some understanding of science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lab Module 2 will cover a description of the scientific method.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <title>Lesson 02: Questioning the Facts</title>
    <body>&lt;h2&gt;&quot;How do I know that it is true?&quot;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a question that you have no doubt asked yourself a hundred times before. It is also a very important question in today&amp;#39;s world. Lets start by looking at a common example that we are faced with in everyday life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Read: Article about Marketing False Claim&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read this article about how a marketing firm was sued for false scientific claims, &quot;&lt;a assets/cortislim_article_2003.pdf" target="_"&gt;FTC: CortiSlim, CortiStress marketers made false claims&lt;/a&gt;&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not an isolated case, and one of the benefits of having knowledge of science is that it can help us from being fooled by false claims that links exist between two things, when in fact they do not. This is very important in our fast-paced information-overloaded world because the media frequently cite:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, contrary to popular belief, science is not just a list of facts to be remembered but rather it is an intellectual activity that encompasses observation, description, experimentation, and explanation of phenomena. In other words, science is a pathway to discover and better understand the world around us, and hence aid in our decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Pseudoscience - where people make scientific‐sounding claims that are not supported by valid scientific studies - e.g. 4 out of 5 doctors recommend drug X to cure backache. Did they ask 5 doctors and if so, is this really representative of all doctors as a whole? Or did they interview a large sample number of doctors representing a good range of the population. These statements are often used to try and sell products.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Anecdotal observations ‐ where people conclude that there is a link between things based on a single or very few observations - e.g. you hear of a cancer patient that beat the odds by drinking prune juice. It may seem harmless but they don&amp;#39;t include large or representative observations, and can therefore lead people to make incorrect conclusions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</body>

    <title>Lesson 03: The Scientific Method</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;An understanding of the scientific method is a good start because learning about science (and its role in society) without learning the process of science is like trying to learn a foreign language with a dictionary as opposed to taking classes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Video: Scientific Method&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scientific method is not a scary technical term, but rather, it is a process of discovery that provides a useful approach to understanding the world. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Right click on the video below and select &amp;#39;Play&quot; to learn more about the scientific method&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;object data="https://online.science.psu.edu/sites/default/files/biol110/sm_wheel.swf" height="480" hspace="20" vspace="20" width="640"&gt;&lt;param name="quality" value="high" /&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="https://online.science.psu.edu/sites/default/files/biol110/sm_wheel.swf" /&gt;&lt;embed height="480" hspace="20" quality="high" src="assets/sm_wheel.swf" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" vspace="20" width="640"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;The four basic steps in the scientific method therefore are:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Make an observation&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Formulate a hypothesis&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Conduct a critical experiment&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Draw conclusions and make revisions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The steps in the method will first be introduced in their generic form and then then reinforced through a worked example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1. Make an observation&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A scientific study always begins with an observation. In effect, you are looking for interesting patterns or cause‐and-effect relationships. In effect, you will generate an interesting question, or set of questions, which will serve as the starting point of your discovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;2. Formulate hypothesis&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have no doubt all come up with a &amp;#39;theory&amp;#39; about something from time to time. For example you may have a &amp;#39;theory that the traffic to university is less if you wake up late.&amp;#39; Unfortunately, the word &amp;#39;theory&amp;#39; is often used to refer to a guess or speculation, whereas in science, a theory is the complete opposite - i.e. something of undeniable certainty - e.g. all organisms are composed of cells. So when you use the word &amp;#39;theory,&amp;#39; what you are in effect really meaning is a hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on observations, the next step is to develop a hypothesis, or a proposed explanation for observed phenomena. The important thing about a hypothesis is that it needs to be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Testable&lt;/strong&gt; - the validity of a hypothesis can only be evaluated by putting it to the test.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Falsifiable&lt;/strong&gt; - a hypothesis must be stated in such a way that you can imagine an observation that would prove it untrue (false).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;It is also important to realize that it is impossible to prove that a hypothesis is absolutely true, as future evidence, when it becomes available, may show that it is not true. As such, hypotheses are generally posed as a negative statement where there is no relationship between two factors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A hypothesis that states no relationship is termed a Null hypothesis, which can be disproved by any observation that contradicts it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the use of a null hypothesis does seem to make some sense, it does raise the problem of what if you do find an effect. This is a valid question that can easily be overcome by stating an Alternative hypothesis, where the converse of the null is stated, and therefore gives you something to accept if you reject the Null hypothesis. It is important to remember that the Alternative hypothesis never makes any predictive statements--it merely states that there is an effect, but not what that effect is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;So in summary,&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Null hypothesis: states that there is no effect.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Alternative hypothesis: states that there is an effect, but not what the effect is.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;3. Conduct a critical experiment&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most effective ways to test a hypothesis is through some form of experimentation. The information that is collected from the experiments is called data. It is this data that is used to actually test the hypothesis (i.e. do I reject or accept my hypothesis?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experiments in their most basic form help you determine the cause‐and‐effect relationship between two things. The information that is collected during the experimental (data gathering) process provides the information that you use to formulate a conclusion. In your daily lives, you may not actually be conducting critical experiments, but accessing and sorting through information from multiple sources to generate a conclusion is akin to the experimental process of a scientist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;4. Draw conclusions and make revisions&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you have the results from the experiment (or information you have gathered from sources), you need to examine and analyze them. This entails looking for patterns and relationships from the data gathered in the experiments. From these, conclusions are drawn to see whether the findings support the hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Science is a fluid process that involves a lot of trial and error over time, so if your conclusions do not support your hypothesis, then you can revise your hypothesis, and start the experimental process again - i.e. revise and start again. &amp;nbsp;This is the cornerstone of scientific discovery because it requires an open mind and the ability to change what you think.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <title>Lesson 04: Applying the Scientific Method</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;Using the headline report in The Biol Daily Times as a worked example, lets look at the steps of the scientific method as it is applied to assessing whether fast food consumption leads to obesity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;VoiceThread: Basic Experimental Design&lt;/h6&gt;

    <title>Lesson 01: Introduction</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;You are becoming familiar with the scientific process, and in particular, hypothesis generation and testing. You have also looked at basic examples of hypothesis testing and experimental design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="assets/scitoolbox_03-1.png" style="width: 400px; height: 276px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the world is a little more complex than what has been talked about so far, and many different studies are conducted that may be of interest to you. &amp;nbsp;So let&amp;#39;s continue our discovery by looking more closely at data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;How is it gathered?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;How is it treated once gathered?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;How is it used to test hypotheses?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learning the process of science cannot be done overnight. Rather, just like a plumber or a carpenter has a toolbox full of the tools needed for their trade to get the job done. &amp;nbsp;Now that you are familiar with the scientific method, over the next few weeks you will start to compile your scientific toolbox that will arm you with all the tools you need to critically test hypotheses. The first step is to understand the differences between a population and a sample, as well as calculating averages and measures of variability.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <title>Lesson 02: Samples and Populations</title>
    <body>&lt;h4&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="assets/psu_party_school.png" style="width: 580px; height: 156px; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;" /&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Congratulations! This definitely sounds like a great achievement. We are Penn State!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this may (or may not) make you proud, let&amp;#39;s take a closer look at this study. Did you get asked questions as part of this survey? &amp;nbsp;Did your friends? &amp;nbsp;Did your dorm neighbor?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am guessing that your answer to most of these questions is NO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are an estimated 14 million students in U.S. universities, and, while the survey sample size of 122,000 university students may seem like a lot, does this result represent the populous view of U.S. university students?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How practical/easy do you think it would be to question all 14 million U.S. university students? It would be a difficult task. So how do you test hypotheses if you cannot use the entire population?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has already been alluded to in your simple experimental design where you used a subset of people to test your hypotheses about fast food and obesity&amp;mdash;i.e. you sub-sampled. In effect, you are making inferences about the entire population based on the smaller sample.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Definitions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Population Sample" src="assets/population_sample.png" style="width: 400px; height: 276px;" title="Population Sample" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Population:&lt;/strong&gt; The group of individuals, or items, to be studied is called the population (N).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-left: 40px;"&gt;E.g. The U.S. university student population in the &quot;Party School&quot; example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-left: 40px;"&gt;E.g. The adult U.S. population in the &quot;Fast Food and Obesity&quot; example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sample:&lt;/strong&gt; A subset (n) of the entire population (N). &amp;nbsp;Those people, objects, or events selected from the population for inclusion in the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-left: 40px;"&gt;E.g. The 122,000 students surveyed in the &quot;Party School&quot; example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-left: 40px;"&gt;E.g. The 50 control group and 50 treatment group individuals in the &quot;Fast Food and Obesity&quot; example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Note that the notation for the entire population is an uppercase N, whereas for the sample it is a lowercase n.&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Here are a few more examples of different situations to help illustrate the difference between samples and populations.&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To answer this you need to step back and look at populations in nature. In nature, most populations have what is called a &lt;b&gt;normal distribution&lt;/b&gt;. Put simply, it turns out that middle values tend to occur more frequently, with outliers, or extreme values, occurring less frequently. This is why you don&amp;#39;t see basketball player-sized people as frequently as you see average height individuals. Let&amp;#39;s illustrate what we mean by looking at the distribution of IQ scores in a population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Video: Distribution of IQ Scores in a Population&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;To play the video, right click and select play.&amp;nbsp; To pause the video, right click and uncheck the play option.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0" height="540px" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="740px"&gt;&lt;param name="play" value="false" /&gt;&lt;param name="quality" value="high" /&gt;&lt;param name="scale" value="showall" /&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="https://online.science.psu.edu/sites/default/files/biol110/mod3_lesson3_distribution.swf" /&gt;&lt;embed height="540px" hspace="10" play="false" pluginspage="http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer" quality="high" scale="showall" src="assets/mod3_lesson3_distribution.swf" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" vspace="10" width="740px"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open the &lt;a assets/mod03_les03_animation_distribution_transcript.pdf" target="_"&gt;transcript of this distribution video&lt;/a&gt; if you would like to read or print the information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, in theory, if you take enough individuals in your sample, you should get more of the middle values, and therefore, a result that resembles that of the population. The million-dollar question, however, is how many is enough for the sample to be representative of the population?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that you are more familiar with the difference between a sample and a population, you can start to address this question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Returning to the &amp;#39;Party School&amp;#39; example. If there are an estimated 14 million students in US universities, 122,000 represents just less than 1% of the US university population. Moreover, on average, there were 325 respondents to the survey per school, which in Penn State&amp;#39;s case amounts to less than 1% of the University Park campus&amp;#39; enrollment of 43,000 students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on this information, would you consider the sample size to be sufficient to draw a definitive conclusion?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While you may like to say yes (due to the pride of going to the top party school), I am sure you will agree that a sample of less than 1% of the population may not be adequate in this case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if you are going to enjoy wearing this new party badge, keep in mind the actual validity behind the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is therefore important to keep in mind that the primary point of sampling is to create a small group from a population that is as similar to the larger population as possible. In essence, you want to have a little group that is like the big group. With that in mind, one of the features you look for in a sample is the degree of representativeness--how well does the sample represent the larger population from which it was drawn?&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <title>Lesson 04: Types of Data</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;Now that you have a better idea of how data is gathered, lets look at how is it treated once gathered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, let&amp;#39;s introduce the common different types of data that you may have, or will come across.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Binary data - generally Yes/No.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Categorical data - where individuals are placed into categories e.g. male and female.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Continuous data - most commonly used where finer measurements are taken e.g. weight, blood pressure, speed etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Binary and categorical data are commonly used in social science and behavioral science, whereas continuous data is commonly used in the life sciences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Examples:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Binary - questionnaire - have you ever suffered from a heart condition? (Yes/No); did you graduate from high school? (Yes/No).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Categorical - smoking status (none, light, heavy); hair color (blond, brown, black, red).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Continuous - weight gain, size of fish, death rates, carbon emissions per country.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Self Check: Different Types of Data&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try this Self-Check to see whether you can differentiate the types of data.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lesson 05: Averages</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;Once an experiment (or survey) is conducted, the results are recorded in their raw form - e.g. each measure per individual is recorded. The end result usually would be a spreadsheet, which consists of a lot of numbers. However, this raw data does not tell you anything about the effect you may be trying to test, and therefore cannot be used to test your hypotheses in the raw form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;VoiceThread: Averages&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s illustrate this using an example that you are no doubt very familiar with--exams and&amp;nbsp;anxiety (stress).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;object height="600" width="800"&gt;&lt;param name="quality" value="high" /&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="https://voicethread.com/book.swf?b=654198" /&gt;&lt;param name="wmode" value="transparent" /&gt;&lt;embed height="600" quality="high" src="https://voicethread.com/book.swf?b=654198" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="800" wmode="transparent"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open the&lt;a assets/mod03_les05_voicethread_averages_transcript.pdf"&gt; transcript of the Averages VoiceThread&lt;/a&gt; if you would like to read or print the information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Self-Check: Averages&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Test your ability to calculate the Mean using this self-check quiz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;object height="600" width="800"&gt;&lt;param name="quality" value="high" /&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="https://voicethread.com/book.swf?b=654198" /&gt;&lt;param name="wmode" value="transparent" /&gt;&lt;embed height="600" quality="high" src="https://voicethread.com/book.swf?b=654198" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="800" wmode="transparent"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Sample Size and Sample Mean&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sample means are sensitive to extreme values, so a single data point can make a noticeable change in the sample mean--especially if the sample size is small. Remember that the primary point of sampling is to create a small group from a population that is as similar to the larger population as possible. Ultimately, you want the sample Mean (X) to approximate the population Mean (m).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Interactive Exercise: Impact of Sample Size on Sample Mean&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try this exercise where you can enter different sample sizes to see how the sample mean differs from the population mean depending on sample size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0" height="600" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="800"&gt;&lt;param name="quality" value="high" /&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="https://online.science.psu.edu/sites/default/files/biol110/samplesizeandmean.swf" /&gt;&lt;embed height="600" hspace="10" pluginspage="http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer" quality="high" src="assets/samplesizeandmean.swf" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" vspace="10" width="800"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open the &lt;a assets/mod03_les05_an_impact_sample_sizes_mean_transcript.pdf"&gt;animation transcript&lt;/a&gt; if you would like to read or print the information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should notice that the calculated sample means get closer to the actual population mean as the sample size increases. Based on the normal probability, the more samples that are taken will increase the number of values that are closer to the population mean and the effect of the outlier values will be reduced accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <title>Lesson 06: Variability</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;As a sample is very unlikely to reflect the population exactly in all respects, there will always be some uncertainty as to how well the sample results reflect the population. You don&amp;#39;t know the population mean, yet you would like to know it, which is why you need to draw your conclusion from the sample mean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But besides calculating the sample mean, there is a need to access the precision (or spread) of the data to determine whether the calculated sample mean is an accurate estimate of the population mean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other simple statistical measures can be used to reduce or quantify the uncertainty, i.e. to measure the variability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;VoiceThread: Standard Deviation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Standard Deviation is the most common measure of variability, measuring the spread of the data set and the relationship of the mean to the rest of the data--i.e. the precision of the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;object height="600" width="800"&gt;&lt;param name="quality" value="high" /&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="https://voicethread.com/book.swf?b=654214" /&gt;&lt;param name="wmode" value="transparent" /&gt;&lt;embed height="600" quality="high" src="https://voicethread.com/book.swf?b=654214" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="800" wmode="transparent"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open the &lt;a assets/mod03_les06_vt_standard_deviation_transcript.pdf"&gt;transcript for the Standard Deviation VoiceThread&lt;/a&gt; if you would like to read or print the information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Self-Check: Standard Deviation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Test your ability to calculate the Standard Deviation using this self-check quiz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0" height="600" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="800"&gt;&lt;param name="quality" value="high" /&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="https://online.science.psu.edu/sites/default/files/biol110/module3lesson6quiz_quiz.swf" /&gt;&lt;embed height="600" hspace="10" pluginspage="http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer" quality="high" src="assets/module3lesson6quiz_quiz.swf" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" vspace="10" width="800"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you remember the million-dollar question of how many is enough for the sample to be representative of the population? The Standard Deviation can greatly help answer this question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Interactive Exercise: Sample Size and Standard Deviation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try this exercise where you can enter different sample sizes to see how the standard deviation changes depending on sample size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0" height="600" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="800"&gt;&lt;param name="quality" value="high" /&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="https://online.science.psu.edu/sites/default/files/biol110/mod3less6samplesizestandarddev.swf" /&gt;&lt;embed height="600" hspace="10" pluginspage="http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer" quality="high" src="assets/mod3less6samplesizestandarddev.swf" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" vspace="10" width="800"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open the &lt;a assets/mod03_les06_an_sample_size_impact_on_sd_transcript.pdf" target="_"&gt;animation transcript&lt;/a&gt; if you would like to read or print the information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will notice that as the sample size increases, the standard deviation generally decreases. This is because the more samples that you take, you are getting a better representation of the scatter in the data (i.e. increasing the number of samples that fit closer to the population mean, and eliminating the weight given to outlier values).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, whenever possible, the more samples that can be taken the better. The bigger the sample size, the better the sample mean will approximate the population mean. While this is the ideal, logistical constraints in terms of time, manpower, cost, and ethics often factor in to the sample size used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Module 3 Wrap-up&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congratulations, you have just gathered your first tools to put into the toolbox and you should now have a better understanding of the difference between samples and populations, as well as the ability to calculate the Mean and Standard Deviation. As such, you are well on your way to enhanced scientific understanding and discovery.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lesson 01: Introduction to Google Spreadsheets</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;Now that you have a better understanding of the calculation and use of means and standard deviations, displaying the results graphically is the next tool to add to the toolbox.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lesson 02: Graphs</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;Now that you have a better understanding of the calculation and use of means and standard deviations, lets explore a little about how they are used not only in science, but in popular media and advertising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because we live in a visual world, graphs are often used in newspapers, magazines, and sports statistics because they communicate information visually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists frequently use graphs to compare effects of variables, look at trends as they develop, and examine hypotheses. In a way, figures are a language through which scientists communicate. While the ability to interpret graphs and tables is a necessary skill in science, it also finds use in everyday life. In articles or textbooks you are likely to find graphs, yet understanding the message will often depend on being able to interpret the many different types of graphs that are presented (such as those appearing in this weeks Biol Daily Times in Lesson 03).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Graphs should be there to aid you, not scare you, so lets take an introductory look into the interpretation of data presented on graphs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While graphs are used in all forms of media, there are a few fundamentals that you should be aware of when assessing a graph. Graphs should be &amp;#39;stand alone&amp;#39; items - i.e. they should not need any further explanation to make sense of them. Besides pie charts that have no axes, a reputable graph should have the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Graphs have a X- (horizontal) and a Y- (vertical) axis. Both the X- and the Y-axes need a label (name). This is important because the person reading the graph needs to know what they are looking at. If it just says 1, 2, 3--what do these numbers represent? It could be cats, drugs, money, fish, etc. A graph without labeled axes is meaningless.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The X-axis usually holds the independent variable (normally the variable that you have control over), and the Y-axis usually holds the dependent variable (the value depends on the value of the independent variable).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;If the numbers used on either the X- or Y-axes contain some measurement unit (e.g. miles, pounds, dollar value, etc.), the unit measurements must accompany the axes label. Once again, the reader needs this information to be able to make sense of what they are looking at.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Graphs need a title (figure legend). The figure legend provides a short explanation of what the graph represents. The figure legend ALWAYS should appear BELOW the graph. Figure legends should NEVER be placed ABOVE the graph.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;</body>

    <title>Lesson 04: Graphing Scales</title>
    <body>&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;One final consideration when interpreting a graph(s) is to make sure that the scales of the axes are appropriate--especially when comparing multiple data sets. This is a form of trickery that is often used in the media and in advertising, where the scales are changed to enhance or reduce an effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take the North Atlantic storm data once again and see what happens when the axis changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It becomes immediately apparent that the trend looks far less dramatic when a scale of 0-100 is used as opposed to 7-15. If the Y-axis units were conveniently omitted (which happens a lot when people are trying to push a point of view), you would never know that the graph on the left was hiding the true data trend.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lesson 05: Plotting Graphs</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;Remember that the raw data is usually a spreadsheet that consists of a lot of numbers. This raw data does not tell you anything about the effect you may be trying to test and therefore cannot be used to test your hypotheses in the raw form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In much the same way, when graphs are used as a visual display of hypothesis testing, a plot of the raw data is going to be equally as meaningless as the raw data table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, you are now experts at summarizing the raw data by calculating Means to get an &amp;#39;average&amp;#39; and Standard Deviations to assess the &amp;#39;variability.&amp;#39; If you have more than a single measurement for a variable, then the Means and Standard Deviations are also the most effective metrics to use when plotting your results.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lesson 01: Introduction</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;Up until now, you have been using descriptive statistics and simple graphical representations. In effect you have been taking a set of data and finding the best way to describe, summarize, and display it--considering both individual variables, and relationships among variables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, while this information can be used to draw some initial conclusions, it does not allow you to make a definitive test of your hypotheses--which is the cornerstone of scientific discovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Scientific Toolbox" class="mt-image-none" src="assets/scitoolbox_05.png" style="width: 570px; height: 393px; margin: 10px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While descriptive statistics and graphs are great to summarize the data and get a sense for what it is showing, in most cases, inferential statistics are used to actually test the hypothesis. In effect, inferential statistics are the science of extrapolating the results of a study to make claims about the larger population, i.e. procedures that allow us to decide whether our sample is representative of the population or not, and as such, allows us to make accurate inferences about the population represented in our samples (e.g. the US university student population in the &amp;#39;Party School&amp;#39; example and the adult US population in the &amp;#39;Fast Food and Obesity&amp;#39; example).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inferential statistics are used to make generalizations from a sample to a population. In any study where the entire population is not sampled, there are two sources of error that may result in a sample mean being different from (not representative of) the population mean from which it is drawn:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Sample bias:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;There is the possibility that some of the experimental subjects may consciously or unconsciously model their behavior based on what they think the researcher expects from them.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The researcher may make consistent errors in the measurements and evaluation of the results.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This bias is the result of a poorly designed experiment and can be easily overcome by designing what is called a blind experiment where the subjects and researcher/measurement taker are not aware of who is in the experimental or in the control group. It is important to have a sound experimental design before the data is generated because once the experiment begins there is no way to reverse the design without staring over again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Sampling error&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Introduced by chance - i.e. a random error.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inferential statistics do not take into account sample bias as it is a research design issue. Rather, inferential statistics only take into account sampling error, i.e. address random error (chance). This is why it is important to have a good experimental design if you want to have confidence in your hypothesis testing.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <title>Lesson 02: Probability</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;Remember that the first step of hypothesis testing is to convert the research question into null and alternative hypotheses. The null hypothesis is a claim of &quot;no difference,&quot; whereas the alternative hypothesis is a claim of &quot;a difference in the population.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the surprising things about science is that it&amp;#39;s actually almost impossible to prove anything true. Instead, all you do is show that things are false. So instead of proving your hypothesis, you just try to prove that all of the alternatives are wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To do this, you need to use inferential statistics to calculate a test statistic from the data. The test statistic is then converted to a conditional probability called a p-value (p = probability).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;VoiceThread: Probability&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;object height="600" width="800"&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://voicethread.com/book.swf?b=694355" /&gt;&lt;param name="wmode" value="transparent" /&gt;&lt;embed height="600" src="http://voicethread.com/book.swf?b=694355" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="800" wmode="transparent"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While 95% is generally acceptable in biological research, medical research generally uses a 99% (or 0.01) probability value, where the risk of getting a result by chance is only 1 out of 100. It is not too difficult to see why this is the case when you are dealing with potential fatal disease diagnoses and treatments etc.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <title>Lesson 03: T-tests</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;If you cast your minds back, you will remember that there are three types of data that have been spoken about--binary, categorical, and continuous. There are different inferential statistical tests for each of the data types.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Statistical tests do not have to be difficult. All of the tests you will do follow simple mathematical equations that you should be comfortable with. For continuous data, they simply use the information that goes into the Mean and the Standard Deviation, of which you are now experts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;t-test (continuous data)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most biological data is continuous data, and a t-test is the simplest and most common statistical procedure used for comparing or contrasting Means from only two groups (think &quot;t for two&quot;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Up until now you have been working with a few different studies that would be appropriate for a t-test:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The &amp;#39;Fast Food and Obesity&amp;#39; study&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The &amp;#39;Exams and Anxiety&amp;#39; study&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While both of these studies are comparing two means, there is a fundamental difference in these two studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The &amp;#39;Fast Food and Obesity&amp;#39; study has two &lt;b&gt;independent&lt;/b&gt; groups--a treatment group and a control group. The individuals in each of these two groups are not the same.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The &amp;#39;Exams and Anxiety&amp;#39; study on the other hand uses measurements from the same individuals--a normal and exam day measurement. The individuals in each of the two groups are the same, and therefore, the results are &lt;b&gt;dependent&lt;/b&gt; on each other.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given these differences, there are two types of t-tests depending on the type of study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Independent (unpaired) t-test&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Dependent (paired) t-test&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the underlying mechanics are the same, they use different formulas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s use these studies as worked examples to show how to perform a t-test, and hence see how p-values are calculated and used in hypothesis testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;VoiceThread: Unpaired (independent) t-test&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;object height="600" width="800"&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://voicethread.com/book.swf?b=696744" /&gt;&lt;param name="wmode" value="transparent" /&gt;&lt;embed height="600" src="http://voicethread.com/book.swf?b=696744" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="800" wmode="transparent"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lesson 02: Review of Plant Reproduction</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s consolidate the past few lessons and return to something that you have no doubt covered before while at school, and look at &amp;#39;plant sex&amp;#39; and pollination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Video: Plant Structures&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to fully understand how plants &amp;#39;have sex&amp;#39; (reproduce), it is essential to have a sound knowledge of the structural parts of flowers, particularly the reproductive structures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="600" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/3V9k_y6q07o" width="800"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open the &lt;a assets/anim1_narration_small.pdf"&gt;transcript of the plant structures&lt;/a&gt; video if you would like to read or print the information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a &lt;a assets/structural_parts_flowers.pdf"&gt;printable document&lt;/a&gt; on flower structures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Interactive Exercise: Key Reproductive Structures of a Flower&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To test your knowledge of the key reproductive structures of a flower, try this exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Armed with a sound knowledge of the structural parts of flowers, the next step in the reproductive process is pollination--transfer of pollen from flower to flower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0" height="600" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="800"&gt;&lt;param name="quality" value="high" /&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="https://online.science.psu.edu/sites/default/files/biol110/05_plant_structures.swf" /&gt;&lt;embed height="600" hspace="10" pluginspage="http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer" quality="high" src="assets/05_plant_structures.swf" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" vspace="10" width="800"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final piece in the puzzle occurs after pollination, i.e. fertilization. If fertilization is successful, the end result will be the development into fruit and the eventual dispersal of genetic information contained in the seeds.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lesson 03: Thinking about Impact</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;Plants and pollinators have co-evolved physical characteristics that make them more likely to interact successfully, which has, in turn, led to the great diversity of flowers in nature. The plants benefit from attracting a particular type of pollinator to its flower, ensuring that its pollen will be carried to another flower of the same species and hopefully resulting in successful reproduction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plants and pollinators do not have the same goals. Plants want to maximize the spread of pollen to new individuals, while at the same time minimize the energetic costs of producing pollen and nectar to attract pollinator vectors. Pollinators, on the other hand, want to maximize energetic rewards of high quality food in the form of proteinaceous pollen and sugary nectar, while at the same time minimize the cost of foraging. These seemingly antagonistic goals can result in highly specialized relationships between plant and pollinator symbionts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the pollinators that you may have learned about include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this may seem familiar to you now, it probably brings up the age-old question from most of your school science classes: Why do I care?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Video: Why care about Bees?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who cares about bees? Their stings are painful and less bees would be a good thing. Or would it? Watch this video to learn more:&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lesson 01: Introduction</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;Hopefully by now the age old myth that science is boring and not relevant to your life is slowly disappearing, as science affects you from the time you wake up until the time you finally go to sleep. Your alarm clock, the weather report, the asphalt you drive on, the bus or car that you ride in, your cell phone, your mp3 player, the tablets that treat your headache (yes you know why), the clean water that comes from your faucet, and the light that you turn off at the end of the day have all been brought to you courtesy of science. While scientific knowledge improves your quality of life, an understanding of science is imperative in the modern world in guiding your decisions on issues such as energy, conservation, agriculture, health, transportation, communication, defense, and economics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are not planning on becoming an active academic scientist, you probably will never get to set-up and do your own experiment, but it is useful to have a good understanding of the scientific method. While much of the scientific information that you will read will probably come from the popular media and/or books, most of this research will first have been published in scientific journals (primary literature). Hundreds of scientific articles are published each week covering disciplines from health to environmental sciences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unless you plan on becoming an active scientist, it is unlikely that you will ever read the primary scientific literature. However, much of the scientific information that you will read will probably come from the popular media, which often reports on research that was first published in the primary scientific literature. So lets just take a quick look at the scientific publication process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;VoiceThread: The scientific publication process&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;object height="600" width="800"&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://voicethread.com/book.swf?b=737580" /&gt;&lt;param name="wmode" value="transparent" /&gt;&lt;embed height="600" src="http://voicethread.com/book.swf?b=737580" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="800" wmode="transparent"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open the &lt;a assets/mod07_les01_vt_scientific_publish_transcript.pdf"&gt;transcript of this VoiceThread&lt;/a&gt; if you would like to read or print the information.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <title>Lesson 02: Science, the Media, and You</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="assets/media_headlines.jpg" style="width: 558px; height: 196px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unless you plan on becoming an active scientist, it is unlikely that you will ever troll through and read the primary scientific literature every week. Instead, you will probably get your scientific information from secondary sources like the popular media. Even in these secondary sources you are constantly confronted with claims about household products, technology, medicine, and even politics--often steeped in the presumed authority of scientific research. These media representations of science and science-related policy are essential for quickly communicating scientific messages to the broad public, however, some important parts of the scientific message can easily get lost or garbled in translation. As such, 76% of US scientists believe that the news media does a poor job at educating the public and believe that a major problem for science is that news reports fail to distinguish between findings that are well-founded and those that are not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How can you as a non-scientist decide what to believe?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="assets/time-maxim.jpg" style="width: 570px; height: 359px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An original piece of scientific research is often adapted into a simplified press release, which is picked up by reporters and translated again into a newspaper, magazine, or Internet article. Needless to say, details can very easily be lost in this chain. However, an understanding of the scientific method and the nature of science are useful skills to make you a better-informed consumer of these media messages and policies, and therefore separate science fact from science fiction.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <title>Lesson 03: Science in the Media Checklist</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;You now have a better understanding of the scientific method and how science works, so you should be in a better position to evaluate the constant information thrown at you via the Internet, television, radio, newspaper, magazine, or advertisement. Using your new-found knowledge in combination with this &quot;science in the media checklist&quot; should increase your scientific literacy significantly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="assets/science_checklist.jpg" style="width: 400px; height: 351px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using this simple checklist should help in separating the fact from the fiction. However, you may not be able to get answers to all the boxes, but the more marks in the green boxes should indicate a more trustworthy source than a list riddled with red box marks. Lets expand on this checklist and take a closer look behind the boxes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Interactive Exercise: Science in Media Checklist&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try this interactive exercise to learn more details about each of the six elements of the science in media checklist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0" height="600" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="800"&gt;&lt;param name="quality" value="high" /&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="https://online.science.psu.edu/sites/default/files/biol110/mediachecklist.swf" /&gt;&lt;embed height="600" hspace="10" pluginspage="http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer" quality="high" src="assets/mediachecklist.swf" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" vspace="10" width="800"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open the &lt;a assets/mod07_les03_ci_media_checklist_transcript.pdf"&gt;transcript for this video&lt;/a&gt; if you would like to read or print the information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not all the necessary information will always be presented to tick all the boxes in the list. Clearly, the more boxes you can tick, the better your appraisal of the media report will be. A good source should provide much of the information needed to address all boxes, but if you are unsure or require additional information, you can always contact the scientist(s) directly or go back to the original scientific journal article, which not only contains the original information, but is free of media bias.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you do not have the checklist, remember these few key questions to guide you:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;What&amp;#39;s the claim?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Who is making the claim?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;What&amp;#39;s the evidence?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Does the data support the claim?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Could there be another explanation?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, keep in mind the hype factor. Big news sells, and science stories are easy prey for people looking to make mountains out of mole hills. Journalists often misquote or spin the quotes from scientists to support their story agenda. So NEVER take headlines or sound bites at face value, as there is undoubtedly more to the story. That said, reading the BBC or New York Times Science/Health/Environment news is a good first pass to obtain somewhat balanced reporting to keep up to date with the exciting scientific discoveries that are shaping our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Read: Magazine Article&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read this article from Time magazine, &quot;&lt;a assets/time_experimental_drug.pdf"&gt;Experimental Drug Helps Treat Osteoporosis&lt;/a&gt;.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that you have read this article, let&amp;#39;s walk through the &quot;science in the media checklist&quot; to properly analyze it from a scientific point of view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;VoiceThread: Walkthrough Checklist of Article&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;object height="600" width="800"&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://voicethread.com/book.swf?b=737656" /&gt;&lt;param name="wmode" value="transparent" /&gt;&lt;embed height="600" src="http://voicethread.com/book.swf?b=737656" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="800" wmode="transparent"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lesson 01: Introduction</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;Throughout the semester, you have been introduced to science. As such, you should now have a better understanding of the scientific method, how science works, and how it is portrayed in the media. In doing so, you are now well on your way to biological literacy, and perhaps unbeknown to you, you have successfully generated hypotheses, collated and analyzed data, as well as drawn conclusions from the information presented. You are now prepared to head out into the world and put your scientific abilities to the test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The remaining three modules differ in structure from the modules completed so far. Rather than containing content followed by an assessment at the end, Modules 8 and 9 are totally assessment-based. They use assessment questions containing information, data, and media articles as a launchpad to not only test your new scientific knowledge but to learn more about the topics of climate change and pandemics (topics which have been at the forefront of our daily lives over the past couple of years). Finally, Module 10 is a group project that runs over a few weeks where you have the creative freedom to pick a topic of your choice, gather information, and produce a VoiceThread presentation as the assessment outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is climate change and global warming?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Climate change is a broad term that refers to long-term changes in climate, including average temperature and rainfall change. Global warming is the gradual increase of the Earth&amp;#39;s average surface temperature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the past 100 years, global average surface temperatures have increased by .9&amp;deg;C (&lt;a class="ext" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_average_surface_temperature" target="_blank"&gt;read more about temperature record&lt;/a&gt; - if you click on the graph on the wikipedia page, you will see a detailed and referenced description of how the graph was produced). The terms &amp;#39;global warming&amp;#39; and &amp;#39;climate change&amp;#39; are often used interchangeably. As a consequence of this and future heating, climate change has been suggested to be one of the greatest social, economic and environmental challenges of our time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The potential impacts of climate change include temperature increases, sea-level rises, melting of the polar ice-caps, changed weather patterns (droughts and floods), and increased sea temperatures among others. If true, not only will these have an impact on species and ecosystems, but they will have a profound effect on our current way of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Click on the image on the right for the full-sized version of &quot;Impacts of Climate Change&quot; for the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="assets/ccimpacts.jpg" style="width: 600px; height: 380px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is causing the warming?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is known for sure is that the incoming energy from the sun in the form of solar radiation passes through the atmosphere and heats the earth&amp;#39;s surface. Approximately 50% of the solar energy directed at the earth is directly absorbed at the surface, and the remaining 50% is reflected and radiated back into space in the form of infrared radiation. However, a proportion (22%) of the reflected infrared radiation is trapped by some atmospheric gases (called greenhouse gases), which results in maintaining the Earth&amp;#39;s temperature at a level necessary to support life (&lt;a class="ext" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_effect" target="_blank"&gt;additional information on the greenhouse effect&lt;/a&gt;). The problem we now face is that there is an increasing amount of greenhouse gases (including methane and carbon dioxide) in the atmosphere that trap heat--the so-called greenhouse effect--whereby less heat is escaping and more heat is being trapped within the atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Video: Man-made or natural?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="480" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/EDIP71Lviys" width="640"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, one of the big questions that we are constantly faced with in the media is whether the warming we are experiencing is a natural phenomenon or whether it is due to human influences. There are many Web sites and media outlets out there that portray different points of view on this subject, but if you are interested in more information, &lt;a class="ext" href="http://www.globalissues.org/article/233/climate-change-and-global-warming-introduction" target="_blank"&gt;Global Issues&lt;/a&gt; provides a brief introduction on global warming from both a social and environmental perspective, and &lt;a class="ext" href="http://www.skepticalscience.com/argument.php" target="_blank"&gt;Skeptical Science&lt;/a&gt; provides a useful synthesis and references to both sides of the global warming debate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This module explores some of the concerns of the climate change debate. At the conclusion of Lesson 2, you will be required to use your new found scientific logic and problem solving abilities to test some of the potential causes and impacts of increasing global temperatures.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <title>Lesson 02: Climate change and you</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;Even though climate change and the media coverage surrounding it can appear overwhelming, there are a number of ways you can take direct action to make your home and lifestyle more environmentally friendly and to reduce your personal carbon footprint. A carbon footprint is a measure of the amount of greenhouse gas (or carbon dioxide equivalent) that is produced from our daily activities over the course of a year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Take Action: Emissions Calculator&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be pro-active and use the following &lt;a class="ext" href="http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/emissions/ind_calculator.html" target="_blank"&gt;online emissions calculator&lt;/a&gt; to get a rough estimate of your personal or family&amp;#39;s greenhouse gas emissions and explore the impact of taking various actions to reduce your emissions. If you do not have access to this type of data from home, try the sample data provided below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="assets/household_emissions.jpg" style="width: 471px; height: 112px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Changing your behavior in small areas can help to have a personal impact on climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Module 8 Assessment Notes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the Module 8 assessment in ANGEL, Question 1 explores whether the warming that the Earth is currently exploring is due to natural (increased solar irradiation) or human (increased atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations due to industrialization) causes.&amp;nbsp; Question 2 focuses on one of the possible impacts of climate change (ocean acidification) and uses real scientific data to explore some of the possible effects of ocean acidification on coral reefs.&amp;nbsp; Finally, Question 3 uses media articles to assess some of the potential impacts of climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Module 8 Wrap Up&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have just finished Module 8. Not only will you put your new scientific information and skills to good use to explore a topic that will feature as a major part of your lives over the coming years, but hopefully you have a better understanding of how your actions can be directly related to some of the issues raised. If you have any questions, please email the instructor via ANGEL.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="480" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/Ea36hYuTrGA" width="640"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flu (also known as influenza) spreads through populations on a yearly basis. The outbreak of H1N1 (otherwise referred to as &amp;#39;swine&amp;#39;) flu has been a major cause of concern globally. Despite the existence of scarier diseases caused by exotic viruses like Ebola, influenza still reigns as the number one infectious killer in modern times. Given the mobility and global nature of the modern world, the influenza virus is no doubt going to have an influence on all of our lives as we move into the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In much the same way as with climate change in Module 8, this module is totally assessment based. This module focuses on the recent H1N1 (&amp;#39;swine&amp;#39;) flu pandemic as a vehicle to not only broaden your knowledge on the subject of pandemics, but more importantly to put your scientific investigative skills to the test. Module 9 also serves as a &quot;mini-version&quot; of what is expected in your Group Projects (to be introduced in Module 10), and therefore provides you with a test run to cement your skills, to ask questions, and to get feedback before you head off into the Group Project next week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What is influenza?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although it is often confused with the common cold, influenza (commonly referred to as the flu) is a much more severe disease than the common cold and is caused by a different type of virus that affects both birds and mammals (&lt;a class="ext" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza" target="_blank"&gt;additional information on influenza&lt;/a&gt;). Influenza is typically transmitted through the air by coughs or sneezes, and the most common symptoms of the disease include chills, fever, sore throat, muscle pains, severe headache, coughing, weakness/fatigue, and general discomfort. In more serious cases, influenza causes pneumonia, which can be fatal, particularly for the young and the elderly. Influenza usually spreads around the world in seasonal epidemics, resulting in the deaths of between 250,000 and 500,000 people every year. However, the death toll can rise into the millions in pandemic years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What is a pandemic?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word pandemic originates from the Greek words &amp;#39;pan&amp;#39; (meaning &amp;#39;all&amp;#39;) and &amp;#39;demos&amp;#39; (meaning &amp;#39;people&amp;#39;) and is used to describe an epidemic that affects the whole population across every continent. An influenza pandemic occurs when:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;a new subtype of influenza virus emerges in humans to which most people have not been previously exposed and are, therefore, highly susceptible.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;the virus causes serious disease in humans.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;the virus is easily and rapidly spread between humans, infecting large numbers of people worldwide and causing many deaths.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior to the recent swine flu outbreak, there have been three major influenza pandemics that have had a significant impact on the world population:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The Spanish flu of 1918 has been the worst influenza pandemic to date, whereby 25% of the world&amp;#39;s population was infected with the virus, resulting in an estimated death toll of 50 million people (exceeding the number of people killed during the entire duration of World War 1).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The Asian flu in 1957 resulted in an estimated death toll of 2 million people.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The Hong Kong flu in 1968 resulted in an estimated death toll of 1 million people.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the World Health Organization, as of February 19, 2010, it is estimated that approximately 16,000 people worldwide have died from the recent H1N1 (&amp;#39;swine&amp;#39;) flu virus.&amp;nbsp; While this may seem like a rather low number compared to the 1918, 1957, and 1968 pandemics, the rapid spread of the recent H1N1 (&amp;#39;swine&amp;#39;) flu virus across the world is a cause for alarm and the relatively low death rate to date is also likely to be a function of better health standards, improved communications, and global organizations monitoring and addressing the pandemic in real-time worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the threat of the swine flu is not yet over and there is no place for complacency at this stage. The recent H1N1 (&amp;#39;swine&amp;#39;) flu is just a modern tangible example of the threat of pandemics (&lt;a class="ext" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandemic" target="_blank"&gt;additional information on pandemics&lt;/a&gt;) -- the impacts of which go way beyond the direct health issues to having both global social and economic ramifications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Module 9 Assessment Notes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The H1N1 (&amp;#39;swine&amp;#39;) flu virus has had a major impact on countries and people all around the world. Penn State is no different and this module requires your scientific logic and problem-solving abilities to be put to good use as a contracted consultant to address the very real H1N1 ramifications for Penn State. The Penn State administrators have compiled a list of resources and a research question, which are available in the Module 9 assessment in ANGEL. You are required to use the resources provided to address the research question and produce a scientific report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Module 9 Wrap Up&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions, please email the instructor via ANGEL. Alternatively, if there is anything in this module that you would like to comment on, or add to, please visit the &quot;Course Feedback&quot; link in the top menu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can now complete the &lt;a class="ext" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1X0Xa_K5W4z3Sx7Lnp0D8mcxcGnaZQvnOdiELKiVggUc/edit" target="_blank"&gt;Module 09 Assessment&lt;/a&gt; and submit it to the &lt;span class="ext"&gt;Angel dropbox&lt;/span&gt; by Friday, July 27th at 11:00PM.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <title>Lesson 01: Introduction</title>
    <body>&lt;h2&gt;Project Description&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the course you have developed an enhanced knowledge of the scientific method, a better appreciation for how science works, as well as how science is reported in the media.&amp;nbsp; Armed with these new skills, you are in a fortunate position to be able to think critically and ask educated and investigative questions.&amp;nbsp; As part of your assessment for the course, you are required to complete a small project with the end result being a VoiceThread that answers a biological (health or environment) question of your choice.&amp;nbsp; While the higher level of the project has formal constraints, you are highly encouraged to be as creative as possible in creating your VoiceThread presentations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The old saying, &quot;you can&amp;#39;t believe everything you read&quot; is very true and you are therefore required to do some scientific investigative journalism on a biological topic of your choice, whereby you use supporting evidence to back statements and claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a list of the &lt;a class="ext" assets/Module_10_Project_Topic_Ideas.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Project Topic Ideas&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Module 10 Structure&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Module 10 will be completed over the next four weeks and is broken up into eight lessons to help you pace yourselves as you complete your project. Below is a brief description of each lesson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Lesson 01: this lesson introduces you to the project and Module 10 as a whole.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Lesson 02: goes over the project requirements.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Lesson 03: describes the project timeline.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Lessons 04-07: describes the project work.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Lesson 08: Module and Course Evaluation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Need Help?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have created a page dedicated with helpful resources for your project. This page is accessible via the &lt;b&gt;Project Help Resources Tab&lt;/b&gt; above. There you will find information about the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;whom to contact if you have questions about your research question&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;whom to contact if you have technical issues with VoiceThread&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;links to VoiceThread tutorials and instructions&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;links to sources for images for your project&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;links to resources on using references and project tips&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the &lt;b&gt;Project Help Resources&lt;/b&gt; page, we have also created an &lt;span class="ext"&gt;&lt;b&gt;ANGEL Discussion Forum&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; dedicated to this project. There you can ask questions and see if other students are seeking the same information that you are. The answer to your question might already be there!&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <title>Lesson 02: Project Requirements</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Project Requirements&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	The requirements of the project are that you use the scientific method to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;ask an interesting and topical biological question&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;generate the appropriate Null and Alternative hypothesis&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;gather the appropriate information from reliable sources to test your hypotheses&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;use supporting evidence to provide conclusions on your research findings as well as any future studies or recommendations that you think are important or necessary&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Additional Project Requirements:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The steps of the scientific method need to be followed in the correct and logical order.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The VoiceThread needs to be limited to less than five minutes.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The text and graphics need to be of sufficient size and quality to be visible on the VoiceThread format.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Use at least five &amp;#39;good quality&amp;#39; reliable references. View the &lt;a assets/referencing.pdf" target="_"&gt;Guide to Referencing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Follow the &lt;span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-file" style="display: inline;"&gt;&lt;a assets/module_10_project_tips.pdf" target="_"&gt;Project Tips&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;VoiceThread Requirements:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Title - should be catchy yet informative. Also a good place to introduce yourself.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Introduction - provide background information and research question.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Hypothesis - Null and Alternative hypotheses stated.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Data Gathered - akin to research methods whereby the data you gathered is summarized and presented in words, tables, graphs, graphics etc.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Conclusion - whether hypotheses were accepted or rejected, why, and what the data is saying.&amp;nbsp; Include other interesting findings you uncovered during your research or other relating information.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Reference list&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Grading Rubric&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	The TAs will be using the &lt;span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-file" style="display: inline;"&gt;&lt;a assets/module_10_rubric_for_students.pdf" target="_"&gt;Module 10 Rubric for Students&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to grade your VoiceThread projects. The TAs will place a &amp;radic; or X alongside each point and then give you a grade for each of the 8 different sections highlighted in gray. The composite of these 8 subsections will form the final total score.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Create a Google Document and share it with your TA. This document will later serve to be your content outline.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Submit project topic (via VoiceThread to your TA - you must name your VoiceThread by labeling your project beginning with the three digit number of your lab section.
		&lt;ul&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;For example: If you are in section 003 and your topic is alternative energy, you will title your VoiceThread &lt;strong&gt;003 Alternative Energy&lt;/strong&gt;.)&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Become familiar with VoiceThread. Before you get started with VoiceThread, be sure to watch &quot;What is a VoiceThread&quot; for a quick tutorial on how to use VoiceThread. In addition, watch &quot;How to make and manage great presentations&quot; for information specific to the project you will be completing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;object height="600" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="800"&gt;&lt;param name="quality" value="high" /&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://voicethread.com/book.swf?b=409" /&gt;&lt;param name="wmode" value="transparent" /&gt;&lt;embed height="600" hspace="10" quality="high" src="http://voicethread.com/book.swf?b=409" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" vspace="10" width="800" wmode="transparent"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;object height="600" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="800"&gt;&lt;param name="quality" value="high" /&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://voicethread.com/book.swf?b=23349" /&gt;&lt;param name="wmode" value="transparent" /&gt;&lt;embed height="600" hspace="10" quality="high" src="http://voicethread.com/book.swf?b=23349" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" vspace="10" width="800" wmode="transparent"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;Look over the &lt;a assets/Module_10_Project_Topic_Ideas.pdf"&gt;Project Topic Ideas&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Select a Topic&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Use Copyright-Free images in your VoiceThread: Images are often protected by copyright.&amp;nbsp; That means you cannot simply Google for images and use what you find.&amp;nbsp; Instead, you must search for images that photographers have made available for use without permissions or copyright protections.&amp;nbsp; You can find sources for such images below:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="ext" href="http://www.flickr.com/creativecommons/" target="_blank"&gt;Flickr Creative Commons&lt;/a&gt;. Images found in Flickr&amp;#39;s creative commons gallery can literally be used for almost any project that is related to education with nothing more than a credit to the original photographer. Be sure to read over the photographer&amp;#39;s rules before reusing images.&lt;/li&gt;
