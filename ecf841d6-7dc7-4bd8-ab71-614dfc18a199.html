<h2>Plants I Part 3 VoiceThread Transcript</h2><p>Slide 1<br>We will now begin discussing the four main groups of plant diversity and we will start with the non-vascular plants.</p><p>The non-vascular plants were the first group of plants to evolve and they retain primitive characterstics such as a lack of vascular tissue.</p><p><br>Slide 2</p><p>The Non-vascular plants are sometimes referred to as the Bryophytes.</p><p>However, the non-vascular plants are not a monophyletic group and this classification system is being updated.</p><p>All members of this group lack vascular tissue which means they hae no tissue to move water and nutrients around the body of the plant. &nbsp;As a result, these plants remain small because they rely on passive diffusion to move water and nutrients around the plant.</p><p><br>This group of plants has no pollen, seeds, flowers or fruit and they reproduce via spores that are released from the parent plant.</p><p><br>Slide 3</p><p>Plants are sexually reproducing organisms and they make gametes - both sperm and eggs. &nbsp;The sperm of the non-vascular plants are flagellated and they need a moist environment so that they can swim to fertilize the egg of a female plant. &nbsp;</p><p>Therefore, the nonvascular plants are found in moist environments - at least during their reproductive stage.</p><p>They are anchored to the soil substrate that they grow on by structures known as rhizoids - these are not roots because true roots have vascular tissue.</p><p>Because they lack vascular tissue nutrients and water must diffuse into the cells of the plant. &nbsp;This keeps the plant small.</p><p>The non-vascular plants have an alternation of generation life cycle like all plants. &nbsp;The non-vascular plants are unique in that the gametophyte is the prominent stage in the life cycle (all other plant groups have a prominent sporophyte).</p><p><br>Slide 4<br>The non-vascular plants includes not only the mosses but also plants known as liverworts and hornworts.</p><p>Slide 5<br>There are about 12,000 species of mosses alone and they grow in shady wet environments like this beautiful and peaceful moss garden in Kyoto, Japan.</p><p>Slide 6<br>Recall that alternation of generations is a life cycle in which there is an alternation between a multicellular haploid and multicellular diploid stage in the life cycle.</p><p>The keyword here is multicellular - both the haploid and the diploid stage are multicellular. &nbsp;This is in contrast to humans, for example, &nbsp;We have a multicellular diploid stage but the haploid cells in the human life cycle only include the sperm and eggs and they are unicellular.</p><p>The diploid stage is the sporophyte and it produces the spores and the haploid stage is the gametophyte and it produces the gametes.</p><p>Slide 7</p><p>In this tutorial we will examine the alternation of generations life cycle in more detail.</p><p>If we start with the multicellular diploid stage - the sporophyte...</p><p>Slide 8</p><p>We see that it creates spores via meiosis (spores are haploid).</p><p><br>Slide 9</p><p>These spores are released from the parent sporophyte and they germinate and grow via mitosis into a multicellular haploid gametophyte.</p><p><br>Slide 10</p><p>The gametophyte produces gametes - both eggs and sperm - via mitosis (remember, the gametophyte cells are haploid so they produce haploid gametes by mitosis).</p><p><br>Slide 11</p><p>Fertilization of an egg by a sperm produces a diploid zygote and this zygote grows via mitosis into a new multicellular sporophyte individual.</p><p>Alternation of generations is a feature of all plants but it looks slightly different in the different types of plants.</p><p>Slide 12</p><p>In the mosses and other non-vascular plants - it is the gametophyte that is prominent.</p><p>There is a separate male and female gametophyte - the male produces sperm and the female produces eggs. &nbsp;The sperm must swim to the egg and fertilization produces the diploid zygote. &nbsp;</p><p>The zygote grows into a sporophyte. &nbsp;In the mosses this sporophyte is small and completely dependent on the gametophyte for nutrition (the sporophyte cannot photosynthesize).</p><p>This is what it means for the gametophyte to be prominent.</p><p>The sporophyte produces spores via meiosis and produces spores that will grow into new gametophytes.</p><p><br>The mosses are heterosporous - there are two different types of spores - one type gives rise to male gametophytes and one type gives rise to female gametophytes. &nbsp;</p>
