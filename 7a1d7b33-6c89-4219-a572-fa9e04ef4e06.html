<p>The first fossil record of a vascular plant is from the Silurian period, about 425 million years ago. This is a drawing of a fossil of&nbsp;<em>Cooksonia</em>. There are many well-preserved fossils, some of which clearly show the vasculature that had begun to form, even in this early plant.</p>
<p>Notice the bulbous projections at the tips of some of the stems. These are thought to have been the spore-producing structures; therefore, this is considered the sporophytic generation of the plant. This is important because it shows that the transition to a more prominent sporophyte had already occurred by this point.</p>
<p>At 5 cm,&nbsp;<em>Cooksonia</em>&nbsp;had grown much taller than the land plants that preceded it. This was due to the vascular tissue that provided the structural support necessary to grow taller on land. Seedless vascular plants went on to dominate the land through the Carboniferous period, about 300 million years ago. At that time, they grew to heights of 15 meters or more. The period is named Carboniferous because it was characterized by swamps filled with tree ferns and other seedless vascular plants that subsequently became the coal that is mined today. The seedless vascular plants now in existence are much smaller, and they are very common in the forests of Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>Vascular tissue is the characteristic that distinguishes the&nbsp;vascular plants from those plants that preceded them. While protected gametes allowed plants to move onto land, it was vascular tissue that allowed plants to dominate the landscape. Vascular tissue provides a means for transport and structural support for the body of the plant. Vascular tissue consists of&nbsp;<strong>xylem</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>phloem</strong>. Xylem is primarily the vasculature through which water and minerals travel from the roots up the stems to the various parts of the plant. Phloem transports the sugars made during photosynthesis down to the roots and around the plant body to provide energy. Thus, there is a net movement of water up and nutrients down. These two types of vessels differ structurally and functionally. The xylem is made of nonliving cells that tend to be more fortified for plant strength. The phloem consists of living cells that are modified to allow the flow of soluble organic nutrients. Vascular tissue gives support to plants.</p>
<p><strong>Lignin</strong>&nbsp;is embedded in plant cell walls between the cellulose matrix, and it is a very stable molecule that does not break down easily. We are able to use wood in construction because of the strength that lignin provides. Lignin plays the same role in plants.</p>
