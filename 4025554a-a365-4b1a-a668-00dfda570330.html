<p>Photosynthesis requires sunlight. But what is sunlight? To answer this question, we will answer three questions:</p>
<ol><li>Where does sunlight come from?</li><li>How does sunlight travel from place to place?</li><li>What happens when sunlight reaches an object?&nbsp;</li></ol>
<p>The answer to the first question is that sunlight comes from thermonuclear reactions in the sun, which release energy in the form of&nbsp;<strong>electromagnetic radiation</strong>.</p>
<p>The answer to the second question is that sunlight (and other forms of light) has both wave and particle characteristics and it travels from place to place as both a wave and as discrete particles of energy.</p>
<p>First, let's look at the wave properties. Light is similar to x-rays, microwaves, and radio waves because they all have a periodic fluctuating character (a wave) that travels through space. They differ because of their&nbsp;<strong>wavelengths</strong>&nbsp;(the peak-to-peak distance between oscillations). Importantly, electromagnetic waves can transfer energy to objects in their paths. Visible light&nbsp;is the portion of the electromagnetic spectrum that has wavelengths detectable by the human eye. These are wavelengths of about 400-700nm.</p>

<p>If light acts as a wave that travels through space, how can it also act as a particle? &nbsp;Light travels as "packets," or quanta of energy known as photons. Each photon has a specific amount of energy. &nbsp;Photons can "bump" into things in their path. These disturbances cause some of the effects of light in the world around us.<br>This brings us to the third question posed about light. What happens when light reaches another object? We have all seen light reflect off of a mirror, which allows us to see ourselves. We have also avoided wearing a black shirt (instead of a white shirt) in the summer because of the heat it absorbs. These two properties of reflection and absorption can help us to understand how plants use light.</p>
<p>Because light consists of photons of energy, reflection can be thought of as photons bouncing off of a leaf. However sometimes the photons of light are absorbed by the leaf to do work. <strong>Pigments</strong> are compounds that absorb light. Different pigments absorb different wavelengths of light. If a structure (e.g., a leaf) lacks pigments that absorb light in a given wavelength range, then that wavelength of light will be reflected. In other words, the color perceived is that which is not absorbed.</p>
<p>As shown in this figure, many colors are absorbed by chlorophyll and carotenoid pigments. Importantly, note that green light is absorbed poorly, which is why chlorophyll-containing leaves appear green to our eyes; green light is not absorbed by green plants, it is reflected.</p>
