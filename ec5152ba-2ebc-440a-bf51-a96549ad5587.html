<h3>Introduction and Learning Objectives&nbsp;</h3>
<p>In the tutorial "Life and Natural Selection", you were introduced to the complexities of defining "life".&nbsp; One characteristic common to all life is cells; all living organisms are comprised of cells.&nbsp; In the previous three tutorials, you learned about prokaryotic cell structure, function, and diversity.&nbsp; This tutorial will focus on the subcellular architecture of eukaryotic cells, the production and transport of proteins throughout eukaryotic cells, and the evolution of eukaryotic cells.</p>
<p>By the end of this tutorial you should have a basic working understanding of:</p>
<ul><li>subcellular organization in eukaryotic cells</li><li>the trafficking of proteins throughout the cell</li><li>the role of the cytoskeleton in cell structure and function</li><li>the Endosymbiotic Theory</li></ul>
<p>Performance Objectives:</p>
<ul><li>Describe the similarities and differences between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells</li><li>Explain the role of the nucleus</li><li>Review the organelles involved in the synthesis of macromolecules in a eukaryotic cell</li><li>Diagram the path of an exported protein from ribosome to cell membrane</li><li>Discuss the role of lysosomes</li><li>Identify the three components of the cytoskeleton and compare and contrast their roles in the cell</li><li>Summarize the roles of mitochondria and chloroplasts, and the evidence for their endosymbiotic origin.</li></ul>
