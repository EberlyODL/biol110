<p>In Mendel's experiments, offspring always looked like one of two phenotypes &nbsp;due to the&nbsp;<strong>complete dominance</strong>&nbsp;of one allele over the other for characters that had two traits. This is not always the case because some genes display&nbsp;<strong>incomplete dominance</strong>. In this type of dominance relationship between two alleles, individuals who are heterozygous exhibit a phenotype intermediate between individuals who are homozygous.&nbsp; For example, this figure&nbsp;depicts the outcome of a cross between a snapdragon with red flowers and one with white flowers the offspring in the F<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;&nbsp;have pink flowers. In this case neither of the alleles for flower color &nbsp;is completely dominant over the other. Therefore, individuals &nbsp;who are heterozygous have a phenotype unlike those with either set of homozygous alleles.</p>
<p>The Punnett square for this cross is like that for any other monohybrid cross. However, the ratio of phenotypes in the F<sub>2&nbsp;</sub>generation is not 3:1 (dominant:recessive), as seen with completely dominant alleles, but rather a 1:2:1 ratio of red:pink:white flowers. Note that in this example the alleles are represented differently than in the previous examples. Since neither allele &nbsp;is dominant over the other, the use of an uppercase and lowercase version of the same letter is not appropriate. In this example the character (flower color) is indicated by a letter (<em>C</em>), and the alleles encoding the trait (white or red) are listed as uppercase subscripts (they are both uppercase because neither is dominant to the other). You may see other symbolic representations for incomplete dominance, but don't let this confuse you. The important thing to know is that some genes are expressed in an incomplete dominant manner.</p>

<p>In a third type of dominance,&nbsp;<strong>codominance</strong>, both alleles are expressed in the phenotype of individuals that have are heterozygous. The human MN Blood group, with alleles designated M and N is an example of codominance. This blood group is determined by the presence of a specific protein on the surface of red blood cells, such as those shown in this figure. Group M individuals have one variant (allele) of this proteins, group N have the other variant protein, and group MN individuals express both variants (alleles) of this protein. In the latter case, the heterozygote does not have an intermediate phenotype; instead, the M and N proteins are both expressed in the phenotype.</p>
<h2>The Three Types of Dominance</h2>
<p>Distinguishing between these three types of dominance is sometimes difficult.&nbsp;Think of complete dominance, incomplete dominance, and codominance as a continuum of dominance relationships among alleles at a gene. At one end is complete dominance, in which the phenotype for only one of the two alleles is expressed in individuals that are heterozygous. At the other end is codominance, in which both alleles are equally expressed in individuals that are heterozygous. In between there are various levels of incomplete dominance, in which individuals that are heterozygous for the alleles display an intermediate phenotype. The key to understanding the difference between the three types is to look at the phenotype of the individuals with heterozygous alleles, then classify the relationship accordingly.</p>
