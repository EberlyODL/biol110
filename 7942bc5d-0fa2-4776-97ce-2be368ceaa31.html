<p>Your neighbor has a female Labrador retriever. This breed has three coat colors, black,&nbsp;chocolate, and yellow. Black labs are dark as night, chocolate labs are a deep, deep&nbsp;brown, and yellow labs appear light brown to white. Their nose, lips and gums can be&nbsp;either brown or black. Your neighbor’s dog is yellow with a black nose. He breeds his&nbsp;dog with a chocolate lab with a brown nose. A photo of the litter is below (the mother is&nbsp;on the left of Figure 13 and all puppies are either black or yellow and have a black nose). Your&nbsp;neighbor has read on a web site that coat color is due to an epistatic interaction between a&nbsp;gene that determines chocolate or black pigment color (designated B) and a gene that is&nbsp;involved in pigment deposition (designated E). Each gene has a recessive allele that does&nbsp;not function. Black labs are B_/E_; chocolate labs are bb/E_; and yellow labs are __/ee. &nbsp;The “E” gene does not appear to be involved in the deposition of pigment to the nose and&nbsp;gums. He comes to you and wants to know the genotype of his dog and he also is a bit confused about the word epistasis because it seems to him that he can explain his litter&nbsp;based on the action of just one gene.</p>
<ul><li>Given these facts, what is the most likely genotype of your neighbor’s dog?&nbsp;</li><li>How does this example demonstrate epistasis?</li></ul>
