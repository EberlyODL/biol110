<h3 id="EnergyII-CellularRespiration(Glycolysis)-IntroductionandLearningObjectives">Introduction and Learning Objectives</h3>
<p>The first tutorial on energy concluded with a discussion of ATP, the molecule that supplies most of the energy for cellular work. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is the end product of&nbsp;<strong>cellular respiration</strong>, which is a catabolic pathway comprised of a series of steps that convert the chemical energy in glucose into the energy contained in ATP. This tutorial will focus on the breakdown of glucose, but keep in mind that molecules can enter the pathway at various points; therefore, glucose is just one of several sugars that can be broken down during cellular respiration. The available energy in glucose (and other sugars) resides within its electrons. These electrons (along with their energy) are removed and passed to intermediate electron carriers in a step-by-step process. These intermediates (e.g., NADH) and the concept of reduction-oxidation reactions (electron transference) will be addressed in this tutorial. By the end of this tutorial you should understand:</p>
<ul><li>The general form of a redox reaction</li><li>Redox and energy</li><li>The role of NAD+ in conveying electrons</li><li>Glycolysis</li><li>Alcohol and lactic acid fermentation, and their exploitation</li></ul>
