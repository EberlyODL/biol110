<p>This tutorial introduced you to the prokaryotes. They are a very diverse group of organisms that are commonly referred to as bacteria; however, they are really comprised of two different domains. One domain, the Archaea, usually grow in the most extreme environments. Their ability to occupy extreme habitats is mirrored by their flexibility in utilizing resources; some species can use metals as an energy source, whereas others can live on oil or hydrogen sulfide. The other prokaryotic domain, the Bacteria, is much more abundant. Although diverse, members of both domains share some common features. Prokaryotes lack membrane-bound nuclei, they are generally single-celled or colonial, and they are very small. The genetic organization of prokaryotes and binary fission as a means for replication aids in their fast generation times, which contributes to relatively quick evolutionary changes. We will continue our discussion of prokaryotes in the next tutorial by exploring their metabolism, structure and function.</p>
