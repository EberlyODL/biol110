<p>The central dogma (prevailing theme) of molecular biology is: DNA is transcribed into messenger RNA, and messenger RNA is translated into proteins. In other words, DNA codes for the synthesis of proteins. This is accomplished via two processes:&nbsp;<strong>transcription</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>translation</strong>. First, one of the DNA strands (the&nbsp;<strong>template strand</strong>) is used as a template to make messenger RNA (mRNA). &nbsp;This molecule of mRNA is complementary to the template strand of the DNA molecule and is identical (except for the substitution of uracil for thymine) to the other strand (known as the "<strong>coding strand"</strong>).</p>
<p>Transcription occurs in the nucleus of eukaryotes, and the mRNA must leave the nucleus and associate with a ribosome to begin the translation of a protein. &nbsp;This figure outlines these steps, along with where they occur in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. Note that because prokaryotes do not have a nucleus, proteins can be translated from mRNA immediately.</p>

<p>It is the sequence of nucleotides (adenines, guanines, cytosines, and thymines) in a DNA molecule that determines the type of protein that is synthesized. However, there are four possible bases and twenty possible amino acids that join to form a polypeptide chain, so one base cannot code for one amino acid; that scenario would yield only four possibilities. A two-base code would provide only sixteen possibilities; a minimum of three bases is needed to specify a particular amino acid. In 1961, Marshall Nirenberg "cracked" the&nbsp;<strong>genetic code</strong>&nbsp;by determining the&nbsp;<strong>codon&nbsp;</strong>(sequence of bases) that specifies the amino acid phenylalanine. The amino acids lysine, glycine and proline followed, and now the sequence of bases that codes for each of the amino acids found in proteins is known.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The genetic code is used by almost all organisms on earth. &nbsp;mRNA codons code for either amino acids or stop codons. &nbsp;Notice that the codon AUG &nbsp;codes for the amino acid methionine and is also a start codon. &nbsp;The AUG codon signals to the protein translation machinery to begin translating the mRNA at that location. &nbsp; While every newly synthesized protein begins with the amino acid methionine, enzymes may remove the methionine during the final processing of the protein.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Because most organisms on earth use this code, the genetic code is considered "universal" and indicates a common origin to life on earth. &nbsp;The genetic code is also&nbsp;"unambiguous" and "redundant." Unambiguous means that the codons are fixed and that each codon specifies one amino acid. For example, ACC codes for tryptophan and nothing else. However, codons may be redundant, meaning that several codons may code for the same amino acid. For example, CAA, CAC, CAG, and CAT all code for a single amino acid (valine). &nbsp;This redundancy provides protection against the detrimental effects of mutation as will be discussed later in this tutorial. &nbsp;</p>
