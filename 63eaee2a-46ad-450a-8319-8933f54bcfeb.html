<p>Typically, females have two X chromosomes, while males have only one; and yet, males undergo normal development. How can this be? The answer lies in an observation that was made by the geneticist Mary Lyon. Female mammals have a dark region located just inside the nucleus, along the nuclear membrane. The object is called a&nbsp;<strong>Barr body</strong>. The Barr body is an inactivated X chromosome that stays condensed throughout the cell cycle. By inactivated, it is meant that most of the genes on the chromosome are not expressed and cannot be used to make proteins. Therefore, like the cells in males, females have only one functioning X chromosome and they contribute only one dose (copy) of the genes on that chromosome. Inactivation of the X chromosome in females compensates for the extra copy, thereby making the production of proteins in the cells of males and females the same.</p>
<p>How is the X chromosome inactivated in female cells? It is a process that happens early in development, when one of the two X chromosomes in the cells of the embryo becomes inactivated. If there are more than two X chromosomes, the extra X chromosomes also inactivate. &nbsp;It appears to be a random process, with about 50% of the cells inactivating the maternal X and 50% inactivating the paternal X.</p>
<p>The results of inactivation are easily seen in tortoiseshell and calico cats. The gene for orange fur is on the X chromosome in cats. If a cat is heterozygous for the orange allele (O = orange, o = not orange), then random inactivation of the X chromosomes causes patches of orange and not orange (usually black) fur. This is why male calico cats are so rare. They must have an XXY chromosome complement. (This chromosome complement causes Klinefelter syndrome in humans.) In these males, one of the X chromosomes is inactivated and Barr bodies are found in their cells. Because of the presence of the functional Y chromosome, however, these individuals are genetically male.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The gene for the inactivation of the X chromosome, called the&nbsp;<strong>XIST gene</strong>, is located on the X chromosome. This gene does not appear to code for a protein. It is one of the few genes expressed on the inactivated X chromosome. The gene is transcribed, producing many copies of an RNA molecule. These RNAs attach to the DNA on the same X chromosome, inactivating it. Scientists are still researching the phenomenon. For example, it is uncertain how cells determine if an X chromosome should be inactivated or not. There is still a lot to learn about X-inactivation in mammals.</p>
