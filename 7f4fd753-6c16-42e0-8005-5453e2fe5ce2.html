<p>This tutorial continues our discussion of the major features of animal evolution, concentrating on the bilateria. Previously we introduced three phyla: Porifera, Cnidaria, and Platyhelminthes. These groups include representatives of the parazoa, radiata, and bilateria, respectively. We will begin by distinguishing among the organisms with body cavities, the pseudocoelomates and true coelomates. We will then discuss representative lineages of the protostome coelomates, including molluscs, annelids and arthropods. &nbsp;As you progress through this tutorial, compare and contrast these protostome taxa. &nbsp;How are these groups of animals similar? What morphological and developmental patterns do they have in common? How do they differ? By the end of this tutorial you should have a better understanding of:</p>
<ul><li>How specific organisms coincide with the major branch points in the phylogenetic tree in the evolution of animals</li><li>Characteristics of organisms in Phyla Nematoda</li><li>How some species of&nbsp;roundworms cause disease&nbsp;in humans</li><li>The members of the Phylum Mollosca, and the constraints a shell imposes on their body plan and development</li><li>The importance of segmentation in the annelids</li><li>Why the animals in Phylum Arthropoda are thought to be so successful</li><li>The diversity of ecologies and body plans in the Phylum Arthropoda</li></ul>
<p><strong>Performance objectives:</strong></p>
<ul><li>Identify the two groups of pseudocoelomates, their general characteristics and the human impacts of nematodes</li><li>Compare and contrast the two groups of animals with true coelems, the protostomes and deuterostomes, including the differences in development seen in these two groups</li><li>Discuss the characteristics of the organisms that are members of the Mollusca</li><li>Describe the characteristics of the organisms that are members of the Annelida</li><li>Explain the characteristics of arthropods that have made them successful</li><li>Review the diversity of arthropod groups, including trends in arthropod evolution</li></ul>
