<h2>Introduction and Goals</h2>
<p>Life is composed of a myriad of biomolecules (molecules found in living organisms). With all of life&#39;s diversity, however, there is a ubiquitous presence of carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen. Carbon plays a particularly important role in these molecules by virtue of its unique chemical properties. In this tutorial you will learn why some biomolecules readily interact with water, and why some do not. We will examine how relatively simple subunits, monomers, can be hooked together by chemical bonds to make much larger complex macromolecules, polymers. By the end of this tutorial you should have a basic working understanding of:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The basic properties of water, and its influence on biomolecules</li>
	<li>The basic properties of lipids, carbohydrates, proteins, and nucleic acids</li>
	<li>Carbon&#39;s importance to life</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Properties of Water</h2>
<p>Water (H<sub>2</sub>O) is fundamental to the existence of life as we know it. Indeed, it is so familiar to us that we take its properties for granted. What makes water so important? Why does water exist? What is the relationship between water and other biomolecules? In order to answer these questions we need to take a close look at water and at some of the subatomic properties of its electrons, which have a profound influence on its character.</p>
<p><img alt="Figure 1. Hydrogen bonds between water molecules." src="https://online.science.psu.edu/sites/default/files/biol110/tutorial16_hydrogen_bonds.jpg" style="height: 309px; width: 400px;" title="Figure 1. Hydrogen bonds between water molecules." /></p>
<p>As you probably learned in elementary school, a single molecule of water consists of two hydrogen atoms covalently bound to one oxygen atom. This arrangement does not sound very exciting, however, a closer examination of the bonds within the water molecule reveals something unique. Specifically, water is a <strong>polar</strong> molecule, meaning that it has different electrical properties on opposite ends; specifically, it has two partial positive charges in association with the two H-atoms, and two partial negative charges associated with the oxygen atom.</p>
<p>To understand these electrical properties, you need to know that not all <strong>covalent bonds</strong> (those bonds that involve the sharing of electrons) are equal. Specifically, oxygen tends to pull electrons close to itself when forming covalent bonds with hydrogen. This creates an unequal distribution around each O-H bond; therefore, the hydrogen has a partial positive charge (and conversely, the oxygen has a slightly negative character). Importantly, the partial negative charges on one water molecule can interact with the partial positive charges on another water molecule to form a <strong>hydrogen bond</strong> (as shown in Figure 1 with dotted lines). Hydrogen bonds contribute to many of the unique features of water.</p>
<h2>More About Water</h2>
<p>&nbsp;The state in which liquid water molecules are stuck together, via H-bonding, gives water a physical property termed <strong>cohesion</strong>. Due to cohesion, water has a high <strong>surface tension</strong>(resistance to disruption at the surface). This property is exploited by many insects (e.g., the stone fly pictured above) and some vertebrates (e.g., the basilisk lizard), which can actually stand or run on water without breaking the surface and falling through.</p>
<p><img alt="Figure 2. Surface tension of water.  A stonefly stands on water." src="https://online.science.psu.edu/sites/default/files/biol110/tutorial16_surface_tension.jpg" title="Figure 2. Surface tension of water.  A stonefly stands on water." /></p>
<p>Water is a repository for heat due to its high <strong>specific heat</strong>. This means that it takes a relatively large amount of energy to raise the temperature of water. Therefore, water absorbs (and stores) heat energy more efficiently than many other substances. Biologically, this is extremely important because large bodies of water tend to have relatively stable temperatures, whereas the air around them may fluctuate. The moderate temperatures in oceans and large lakes make them suitable year-round for an abundance of aquatic life. Water also has a relatively high <strong>heat of vaporization</strong>, therefore, water is relatively resistant to phase changes. (It takes a relatively large amount of energy to break all of the H-bonds in water to produce water vapor or steam.) This property allows some organisms to use water, in the form of sweat, to cool down.</p>
<p><img alt="Figure 3.  The structure of ice compared with the structure of water." src="https://online.science.psu.edu/sites/default/files/biol110/tutorial16_ice_water.jpg" style="height: 386px; width: 600px;" title="Figure 3.  The structure of ice compared with the structure of water." /></p>
<p>Water expands during freezing. When water molecules slow down and ice forms (below freezing), the hydrogen bonds keep water molecules at a distance from each other in a characteristic, 3-dimensional crystal that is relatively spacious. The distinction between ice and liquid water is illustrated in this figure, which also depicts how this arrangement makes ice less dense than water, thereby allowing ice to float on water.</p>
<p>Water is an excellent <strong>solvent</strong>, capable of dissolving many compounds. The polar character of water means that anything with a charge can dissolve in water. NaCl is table salt, and when added to water its sodium and chloride atoms disassociate. These ions have a charge. Both the positively charged sodium ions (Na+) and negatively charged chloride ions (Cl-) can readily bond to the polar water molecules, and in doing so they dissolve. Compounds that dissolve readily in water are <strong>hydrophilic</strong>. Compounds that do not interact with water are <strong>hydrophobic</strong>.</p>
<p>In conclusion, water has many important properties that are important to life. The cells of terrestrial organisms (including ours) contain greater than 70% water, and most cells are surrounded by water. This means that a large percentage of biomolecules operate in an aqueous compartment. It should not surprise you to learn that water plays an important role in the functioning of biochemicals. In the next few sections you will learn about four classes of biomolecules and about how their unique characteristics (and synthesis) involve water.</p>
<h2>Carbon</h2>
<p>The world is comprised of organic and inorganic compounds. <strong>Inorganic compounds</strong> include water and mineral rocks. An inorganic compound does not contain carbon. In contrast, <strong>organic compounds</strong> do contain carbon and are prevalent in living systems. They provide us with colors, tastes, and odors, along with the abilities to perceive and act. In other words, carbon compounds are essential to our existence. What is it about carbon that makes it so fundamental to life on Earth?&nbsp; Carbon has four <strong>electrons</strong> (a negatively charged part of an atom) in its outermost orbital. This <strong>valence</strong> of four allows each carbon atom to form stable associations with up to four other atoms, including other carbon atoms. Carbon can form single, double, or triple bonds. That is, it can share one, two, or three of its valence electrons with another atom. By convention, a single, double, or triple line is used to denote these different types of bonds. A single carbon atom bound to another carbon atom is the building block for a seemingly endless variety of chain- and ring-structured molecules. The two figures on this page represent a small portion of the thousands of organic compounds that exist.</p>

<p>&nbsp;We will address four classes of large organic compounds (<strong>macromolecules</strong>): carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids. Note that three of these (carbohydrates, proteins, and nucleic acids) are actually formed through the synthesis of many similar or identical building blocks. These building blocks (monomers) are linked to form polymers. The general process of joining monomers to form a polymer is termed <strong>anabolism</strong>, which can involve many steps. Conversely, a polymer can be broken down into its monomers by <strong>catabolism</strong>, which also can involve multiple steps.</p>

<h2>Hydrolysis and Condensation</h2>
<p><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0" data="https://online.science.psu.edu/sites/default/files/biol110/tutorial16_condensation_hydrolysis.swf" height="480" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="640"><param name="quality" value="high" /><param name="movie" value="https://online.science.psu.edu/sites/default/files/biol110/tutorial16_condensation_hydrolysis.swf" /><embed height="480" hspace="10" pluginspage="http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer" quality="high" src="https://online.science.psu.edu/sites/default/files/biol110/tutorial16_condensation_hydrolysis.swf" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" vspace="10" width="640"></embed></object></p>
<p>There are thousands of different types of biochemical reactions. Although they may involve the joining or breaking down of a myriad of molecules, most use the same basic chemical reaction. Anabolic reactions typically involve the joining of monomers by the removal of a water molecule. In this case an hydroxide (OH) is removed from one molecule and a hydrogen (H) is removed from the adjacent combining molecule. This type of reaction, termed <strong>condensation synthesis</strong> (or <strong>dehydration synthesis</strong>), is illustrated in the animation shown here. Select condensation, and hit play.</p>
<p>This animation also depicts a <strong>hydrolysis</strong> reaction (a type of catabolism whereby a polymer is broken down by the addition of water).&nbsp; Hit the "home" icon to return to the beginning; select condensation and hit play.</p>
<h2>Carbohydrates</h2>
<p><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0" data="https://online.science.psu.edu/sites/default/files/biol110/tutorial16_disaccharide_formation.swf" height="480" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="640"><param name="quality" value="high" /><param name="movie" value="https://online.science.psu.edu/sites/default/files/biol110/tutorial16_disaccharide_formation.swf" /><embed height="480" hspace="10" pluginspage="http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer" quality="high" src="https://online.science.psu.edu/sites/default/files/biol110/tutorial16_disaccharide_formation.swf" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" vspace="10" width="640"></embed></object></p>
<p><strong>Carbohydrate</strong> biomolecules generally have a basic structural formula that is written as C(H<sub>2</sub>O)n. They have many functions in cells. They can be used for energy storage (e.g., starch) and as structural molecules (e.g., cellulose). They also play a role in information storage in <strong>nucleic acids</strong> (organic compounds that make up RNA and DNA).</p>
<p>The basic monomeric units of carbohydrates are the simple sugars (<strong>monosaccharides</strong>). Monosaccharides include glucose (also known as dextrose), fructose, ribose, galactose, and ribulose. Note, the -ose suffix is used by chemists to describe all carbohydrates.</p>
<p>A <strong>disaccharide</strong> is a sugar formed by a condensation reaction between two monosaccharides, which is shown in an animation on the right.&nbsp; Condensation synthesis of maltose (glucose + glucose), a common disaccharide, is illustrated in the following animation. Other disaccharides include sucrose (glucose + fructose) and lactose (glucose + galactose); sucrose is common table sugar, and lactose is milk sugar.</p>
<p>More complex forms of carbohydrates can be synthesized by cells via additional condensation reactions. <strong>Polysaccharide</strong> polymers can consist of up to several thousand monomers of simple sugars. The type of polysaccharide is determined by the number, type, and arrangement of its monomers. Starch is a polymer of glucose monomers. It is used by plants to store surplus sugar. Besides being important to the physiology of plants, starch has many industrial usages. Animals store surplus sugar in the form of glycogen.</p>
<p><img alt="Figure 6. Exoskeleton made of chitin.  The exoskeletons of arthropods, like this fiddler crab, are made of the polysaccharide chitin." src="https://online.science.psu.edu/sites/default/files/biol110/tutorial16_fiddler_crab.jpg" title="Figure 6. Exoskeleton made of chitin.  The exoskeletons of arthropods, like this fiddler crab, are made of the polysaccharide chitin." /></p>
<p>&nbsp;Cellulose, another polymer of glucose, is an important component of plant cell walls; it is also the most abundant polymer on the planet. Although humans cannot digest cellulose, it is a valuable part of our diet because this "fiber" helps to maintain a healthy digestive tract. Some animals, such as the crab shown here, and fungi use another polysaccharide, chitin, for structural purposes.</p>
<h2>Lipids</h2>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>Lipids</strong> are an assortment of molecules so diverse that it may seem odd to group them together. However, they do share one common trait; they are all (to some extent) hydrophobic. As previously stated, some lipids are amphipathic. This property is used by cells to construct membranes. Lipids can be solid (fats) or liquid (oils) at room temperature. Chemically, the difference between fats and oils is very subtle.<object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0" data="https://online.science.psu.edu/sites/default/files/biol110/tutorial16_fat_synthesis.swf" height="480" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="640"><param name="quality" value="high" /><param name="movie" value="https://online.science.psu.edu/sites/default/files/biol110/tutorial16_fat_synthesis.swf" /><embed align="" height="480" hspace="10" pluginspage="http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer" quality="high" src="https://online.science.psu.edu/sites/default/files/biol110/tutorial16_fat_synthesis.swf" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" vspace="10" width="640"></embed></object></p>
<p><img alt="Figure 7.  Lipids - The Triacylglycerols.  Fats and oils have three fatty acid molecules (only one strand is shown here) and one glycerol molecule (not shown). Double bonds determine whether a fat is saturated or unsaturated." src="https://online.science.psu.edu/sites/default/files/biol110/tutorial16_triacylglycerols.jpg" style="height: 400px; width: 400px;" title="Figure 7.  Lipids - The Triacylglycerols.  Fats and oils have three fatty acid molecules (only one strand is shown here) and one glycerol molecule (not shown). Double bonds determine whether a fat is saturated or unsaturated." /></p>
<p>Fats and oils are <strong>triacylglycerols</strong>, which are formed when three fatty acid molecules and one glycerol molecule join via condensation synthesis. This animation depicts the synthesis of a triacylglycerol molecule.</p>
<p>Fats can be saturated or unsaturated. <strong>Saturated fats</strong> do not have double bonds in their chains because their carbon is bound to two other carbons and two hydrogens. <strong>Unsaturated fats</strong> have double bonds along their lengths (monounsaturated = one double bond, polyunsaturated = more than one double bond). Saturated fats have straight chains that organize into more tightly packed arrangements. In contrast, unsaturated fats have kinks caused by the double bonds, which do not permit tight packing. Thus, saturated fats tend to be solids at room temperature, whereas unsaturated fats are usually liquid. A liquid unsaturated fat can be converted to a solid saturated fat by a process called hydrogenation (e.g., margarine).</p>
<p><img alt="Figure 8. Lipids - The Phospholipids.  Phospholipids have two fatty acid molecules, and a glycerol molecule joined to a phosphate group." src="https://online.science.psu.edu/sites/default/files/biol110/tutorial16_phospholipids.jpg" title="Figure 8. Lipids - The Phospholipids.  Phospholipids have two fatty acid molecules, and a glycerol molecule joined to a phosphate group." /></p>
<p>Fats are used in energy storage, protection, and insulation. Aquatic and polar mammals counteract heat loss by having extra fat for insulation. Compare the Arctic polar bear and subtropical gazelle. Clearly, they don&#39;t have a similar need for extra insulation.</p>
<p><img alt="Figure 9.  Lipids - The Steroids.  Steroids are fused ring structures. Cholesterol is a steroid." src="https://online.science.psu.edu/sites/default/files/biol110/tutorial16_steroids.jpg" title="Figure 9.  Lipids - The Steroids.  Steroids are fused ring structures. Cholesterol is a steroid." /></p>
<p>In contrast to the fats, <strong>phospholipids</strong> have only two fatty acids molecules, and glycerol joined to a phosphate group. This figure depicts this arrangement of two hydrophobic "tails" attached to a hydrophilic "head" (the phosphate group is charged, allowing it to dissolve in water). This unique structure forms the basis for the phospholipid bilayer of cell membranes (a topic to be discussed in future tutorials).</p>
<p>Another group of lipids, the <strong>steroids</strong>, is characterized by fused ring structures (shown here). The steroids include cholesterol, and certain hormones (e.g., testosterone) produced from cholesterol.</p>
<h2>Proteins</h2>
<p><object align="" data="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2120827" height="480" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="640"><param name="quality" value="high" /><param name="movie" value="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2120827" /><param name="wmode" value="transparent" /><embed height="480" hspace="10" quality="high" src="http://psu.voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2120827" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" vspace="10" width="640" wmode="transparent"></embed></object></p>
<p><strong>Proteins</strong> are functionally and structurally diverse. The digestive enzymes that break apart your food are proteins. The pigment that affects skin color, melanin, is a protein. Silk is a protein. Proteins move your muscles, attack invading bacteria and viruses, and transport oxygen to all of the cells in your body.</p>
<p><img alt="Figure 10. The general formula for amino acids." src="https://online.science.psu.edu/sites/default/files/biol110/tutorial16_amino_acids.jpg" title="Figure 10. The general formula for amino acids." /></p>
<p>The basic monomer of proteins is the <strong>amino acid</strong>. The general structure of an amino acid is shown here. Note, this basic structure contains an "R" group that is variable in chemical composition. Typically there are twenty different R-groups, and hence the same number of commonly seen amino acids.</p>
<p><img alt="Figure 11.  The twenty amino acids that make up proteins.  The R-groups are found in the shaded boxes." src="https://online.science.psu.edu/sites/default/files/biol110/tutorial16_R_groups.jpg" style="height: 387px; width: 600px;" title="Figure 11.  The twenty amino acids that make up proteins.  The R-groups are found in the shaded boxes." /></p>
<p>This figure depicts the chemical diversity of the twenty amino acids that make up proteins. Note the "R-group" can be classified as nonpolar, polar, or charged.</p>
<p><strong>Polypeptides</strong> are a polymer (chain) of amino acids. Proteins consist of one or more polypeptide chains arranged in a specific conformation. The order of amino acids in a particular polypeptide chain is determined by the specific gene for that chain. In other words, every polypeptide chain has a corresponding gene. Polypeptides are formed by the linking of the carboxyl group of one amino acid to the amino group of an adjacent amino acid.<strong>Peptide bond</strong> formation is an example of condensation synthesis, whereby one water molecule is removed to join two amino acids.</p>
<p>The animation shown here illustrates peptide bond formation. Do not simply think of proteins as linear strings of amino acids. In reality, they fold into a three-dimensional structure and take on complex shapes.</p>

<h1>Nucleic Acids</h1>
<p><img alt="Figure 13. DNA nucleotide components." src="https://online.science.psu.edu/sites/default/files/biol110/tutorial16_DNA_nucleotides.jpg" style="height: 524px; width: 600px;" title="Figure 13. DNA nucleotide components." /><img alt="Figure 12. The structure of nucleic acids.  DNA and RNA consist of a sugar, a phosphate group, and a nitrogenous base." src="https://online.science.psu.edu/sites/default/files/biol110/tutorial16_nucleic_acid.jpg" style="height: 477px; width: 600px;" title="Figure 12. The structure of nucleic acids.  DNA and RNA consist of a sugar, a phosphate group, and a nitrogenous base." /></p>
<p>The nucleic acids are <strong>deoxyribonucleic acid</strong> (DNA) and <strong>ribonucleic acid</strong>(RNA). DNA and RNA work together to affect the synthesis of proteins. Nucleic acid molecules are polymers of nucleotides, which are simple structures that consist of a sugar, a phosphate, and a nitrogenous base. <strong>Nitrogenous bases</strong> are ringed structures consisting of nitrogen, carbon, and hydrogen (depicted at right).</p>
<p>&nbsp;Specifically, RNA nucleotides have ribose as their sugar and any one of the following nitrogenous bases: adenine, guanine, cytosine, and uracil. DNA nucleotides have deoxyribose as their sugar and any one of the following nitrogenous bases: adenine, guanine, cytosine, and thymine (shown at left).</p>
<p><img alt="Figure 14.  The structure of a DNA molecule." src="https://online.science.psu.edu/sites/default/files/biol110/tutorial16_DNA_structure.jpg" style="height: 667px; width: 600px;" title="Figure 14.  The structure of a DNA molecule." /></p>
<p>This figure illustrates how nucleotide monomers are joined to make a nucleic acid polymer; in this case a DNA double helix.</p>

<p>DNA usually exists as paired strands, with the two sides held together by hydrogen bonds between the nitrogenous bases (shown in more detail at right). Specifically, cytosine will bind to guanine, and thymine to adenine. However, RNA is a single-stranded molecule.The roles of DNA and RNA will be discussed in future tutorials.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This tutorial focused on basic biochemistry. Many of life&#39;s chemical processes involve the synthesis of larger molecules from smaller building blocks, in an event that is generally termed anabolism. These larger molecules can then be broken down in a process that is termed catabolism. Later in the course we will examine some specific anabolic events and how they contribute to the life of a growing organism. We will also examine how catabolic events can be used to transduce energy that is necessary to sustain life. To understand these biochemical events, it is important to know some basic chemistry.</p>
<p>Our bodies are comprised of over 70% water. All life on the planet depends on this molecule, and you should be aware of the polar character of this molecule and how polarity affects the ability of one water molecule to interact with another water molecule, as well as with other polar molecules. Water is an excellent solvent and is capable of dissolving a variety of polar molecules. A molecule that can readily interact with water is a hydrophilic molecule, and one that does not interact with water is a hydrophobic molecule. Not all molecules have a strictly hydrophilic/hydrophobic character; some have both and are termed amphipathic (or amphiphilic).</p>
<p>Carbon is a very important element for life. Due to its chemical versatility, it is found in thousands of compounds within living organisms. To understand biochemistry, you need to have a fundamental understanding of the major classes of molecules that are composed of carbon. Additionally, it is important to understand the relationship between these carbon-containing molecules and water.</p>
<p>Lipids are a class of carbon-containing molecules that have a hydrophobic character. They either totally lack any polar characteristics or their polar character is limited to a small area of the molecule. Be sure that you understand how the polar character of a molecule influences its ability to interact with water. Fats are lipids that are solid at room temperature and that do not readily interact with water. On the other hand, oils are lipids that are liquid at room and that do not readily interact with water. Phospholipids are a class of lipids that have amphipathic properties, and they are a major component of cellular membranes.</p>
<p>Carbohydrates are another class of carbon-bearing molecules, and they are used by the cell for energy storage and as structural molecules. Later in the course you will learn how energy is extracted from monosaccharides in the processes of glycolysis and cellular respiration. Carbohydrates are also found as polysaccharides, which are involved in energy storage and in building various cellular components.</p>
<p>Proteins are composed of amino acids (there are twenty naturally occurring amino acids), and these subunits are linked together (via peptide bonds) to form polypeptide chains. A protein may be comprised of a single polypeptide chain (which is encoded by a single gene), or it may be comprised of two or more polypeptides (each polypeptide chain may be encoded for by a separate gene). Proteins play a variety of roles within the living organism. They can catalyze various chemical reactions (catabolic and anabolic), and they can form structural elements. Additionally, some proteins can convert chemical energy into mechanical energy; such proteins are involved in various motor activities within organisms.</p>
