<p>Biology is the study of&nbsp;life. But, what is life? We all recognize it, but defining it can be a challenge and there is no single perfect definition.&nbsp; Some features of living things include: order, the need for energy, growth and development, regulation of one's internal environment, the ability to reproduce, the ability to respond to one's external environment, and evolutionary adaptation.</p>
<p>We will begin our study of life by examining how life behaves over successive generations. Life is not static, and it changes with time. The next section discusses how life changes or "evolves" as a result of natural selection.</p>
