<h2>Plants II Part 4 VoiceThread Transcript</h2><p>Slide 1</p><p>Alternation of generations in the pines is marked by a completely reduced gametophyte and completely prominent sporophyte.</p><p>Most of the conifers, such as a pine tree, are monoecious - male and female cones are found on the same tree.</p><p>The male cone produces the pollen and the female cone produces an egg.</p><p>The pollen must get to a female cone (typically on a different tree) for fertilization to take place.</p><p>When the sperm fertilizes the egg the zygote forms and grows into the multicellular sporophyte.</p><p>This life cycle differs from vascular seedless plants because the embryo spends time housed within a seed.</p><p>The seed then germinates and grows into a new pine tree.&nbsp;</p><p>Slide 2</p><p>The pines are monoecious - both male and female cones are found on the same tree.</p><p>In this image the male pollen producing cones are on the bottom and the female egg producing cones are at the top.</p><p><br>Slide 3</p><p>The seeds that are produced by the pines and other gymnosperms are "naked" - they are not covered in fruit like the seeds of the angiosperms are.</p><p>The seeds come from the female cone and house the developing embryo.</p><p>You may have cooked with or eaten pine nuts - they are the seeds of pine trees.</p>
