<h3>Mitochondria
</h3>
<p><strong>Mitochondria</strong> are present in the cells of most eukaryotes and they are responsible for converting the energy in food molecules into energy in the form of ATP (ATP is a high energy molecule that provides the energy for many cellular reactions). They are also quite abundant; some cells contain a single large mitochondrion, but most eukaryotic cells contain many more. Cells that require a great deal of energy (e.g., muscle cells) can house thousands of mitochondria. The basic structure of a mitochondrion is depicted in the figure below. Mitochondria are enclosed in a double membrane; a smooth outer membrane and an inner membrane that is contorted into a complex of infoldings called cristae. Cristae provide extensive surface areas for processes such as the electron transport chain, which takes place within the inner membrane. This membrane typically contains thousands of copies of electron transport chain proteins. The space within the cristae is the mitochondrial matrix.&nbsp;

</p>
<p>Mitochondria also possess their own genetic material in the form of circular DNA (which, as you will learn, provides an important clue as to how mitochondria arose). Mitochondria and their genetic material are maternally inherited in sexually reproducing organisms. (The sperm mitochondria rarely enter the egg during fertilization.) Therefore, mitochondria are passed to offspring in the cytoplasm of ova. Hence, your mitochondria are virtually identical to your mother's. There are many fascinating consequences associated with this phenomenon. For example, a number of&nbsp;<a href="http://www.umdf.org/site/c.dnJEKLNqFoG/b.3041929/k.BF32/Home.htm" rel="nofollow">maternally inherited diseases</a>&nbsp;are caused by defective genes in mitochondria.

<h3>Chloroplasts
</h3>
<p><strong>Chloroplasts</strong> are double membrane-bound organelles found in plants and algae that are the sites of photosynthesis. The green color of chloroplasts comes from the photosynthetic pigment chlorophyll.
</p>
<p>Like mitochondria, chloroplasts have extensive external compartmentalization that house a large number of electron transport chains that allow the organelle to efficiently convert the energy in sunlight into chemical energy for the cellâ€™s use.&nbsp; We will learn more about photosynthesis later in the course.
</p>
<p>Also similar to mitochondria, chloroplasts have their own circular DNA molecule and are thought to have an evolutionary origin that is similar to the origin of mitochondria.

</p>
<p>It is thought that mitochondria and chloroplasts evolved from prokaryotes that inhabited the cells of other larger prokaryotes. This scenario likely originated as an&nbsp;<strong>endosymbiosis</strong>, in which one organism began living within the body of another. (This type of association is very common.) In the case of mitochondria, it is thought that a relatively large prokaryote (a protoeukaryote) engulfed a smaller prokaryote (a protomitochondrion), and instead of the larger consuming the smaller, they formed an permanent relationship. This engulfment would account for the existence of the inner membrane of mitochondria (the ancestral prokaryotic membrane) and the outer membrane. The symbiosis was mutualistic because it benefited both the protoeukaryote and the protomitochondrion; the protomitochondrion was provided with a safe environment and plenty of raw materials for respiration, and the protoeukaryote was provided with a rich, free supply of fuel in the form of ATP and some safety from the oxidizing power of O<sub>2</sub>; to be discussed in the next section.
</p>
<p>Chloroplasts, which are found in eukaryotic photosynthetic cells, also originated from an ancient symbiosis. In the case of chloroplasts, however, the prokaryote was photosynthetic (probably an ancient cyanobacterium; discussed later in this tutorial). In this case, the ancestors to the modern cells that possess both mitochondria and chloroplasts, at some point in the past, underwent a&nbsp;serial endosymbiosis&nbsp;(sequential endosymbiotic events).
</p>
<h3 id="SubcellularArchitectureoftheEukaryoticCell-EvidencefortheEndosymbiontTheory">Evidence for the Endosymbiont Theory
</h3>
<p>Evidence for the endosymbiont theory is strong. Most convincingly, mitochondria closely resemble&nbsp;<strong>extant</strong>&nbsp;(currently existing) bacteria. Mitochondria are similar in size, and they replicate in a fashion that is very similar to binary fission. Also, the inner membrane of mitochondria bears a strong resemblance to the membranes of prokaryotes, sharing several key proteins and transport systems. Additionally, mitochondria have their own DNA (which takes the form of a circular plasmid, like that of prokaryotes) and they possess all of the cellular machinery required to transcribe and translate their genomes, thereby enabling them to produce their own proteins.
</p>
<p>The character of mitochondrial DNA is much like that seen in modern-day prokaryotes. For example, mitochondrial DNA lack histones, which are associated with eukaryotic nuclear DNA but not with prokaryotic DNA. Additionally, mitochondrial ribosomes are more similar in behavior, structure, and nucleic acid base sequence to the ribosomes of prokaryotes than they are to eukaryotic ribosomes. For example, there is high sequence similarity between the ribosomal RNA of mitochondria and that of modern endosymbiotic bacteria.
</p>
<p>The relationship between mitochondria and eukaryotes has grown so intimate that neither can exist without the other. Most mitochondrial genes are contained within the nucleus of their eukaryotic host cells, which makes mitochondria unable to reproduce and survive independently. Likewise, eukaryotes (e.g., humans) would be unable to manufacture enough ATP to sustain life without the help of mitochondria.

<h3>Selective Pressures Favoring Symbiosis
</h3>
<p>Sometime before 2.2-2.3 billion years ago,&nbsp;cyanobacteria evolved the ability to use H<sub>2</sub>O and CO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;to make organic molecules with the help of solar energy, in a process known as photosynthesis. The primary "waste" product from this type of photosynthesis is O<sub>2</sub>, which began to accumulate in the atmosphere due to the activity of cyanobacteria. Other earlier forms of photosynthesis probably relied on H<sub>2</sub>S rather than H<sub>2</sub>O and did not result in the release of O<sub>2</sub>. For millions of years, cyanobacterial photosynthesis did not change the Earth's atmosphere; oxygen released by photosynthesizing mats of marine cyanobacteria combined with iron ions in the ocean, forming iron oxide that precipitated to the sea floor. When these iron ions were depleted, oxygen began to accumulate in seawater and eventually it diffused into the atmosphere.

<p>The change in atmospheric composition due to cyanobacteria was enormous, even more severe than the pollution associated with industrialized civilization. Oxygen is a powerful oxidizer, and its tendency to strip electrons and attack the bonds of organic molecules can be very dangerous to living organisms. The atmospheric changes effected by cyanobacteria probably resulted in numerous extinctions, but conversely, they also led to novel adaptations (e.g., the production of antioxidants). Furthermore, some organisms also evolved the ability to detoxify oxygen by reducing it with electrons from other molecules. Electron transport chains, such as the ones that exist in modern-day mitochondria, might have evolved as mechanisms for counteracting the destructive effects of O<sub>2</sub>, secondarily becoming a means of energy production over evolutionary time. The ancestors of eukaryotes might have gained an advantage in an oxygen-rich atmosphere by adopting endosymbionts to detoxify O<sub>2</sub>. The additional benefit that eukaryotes enjoy today, ATP synthesis, might be a derived function.
