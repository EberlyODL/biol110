<p id="ProkaryotesI-CellularandGeneticOrganization-Classification">In the last few decades, several taxonomic schemes have been used to classify the world's organisms. One of the simplest divides life into prokaryotes and eukaryotes; that is, those organisms without nuclei went into one group and those with nuclei went into another, respectively. Another commonly used scheme divides life into five kingdoms: Monera (prokaryotes), Protista, Plantae, Fungi, and Animalia. You may see one of these schemes in an older textbook or website. Keep in mind that classification schemes strive to show the evolutionary relationships between groups, and in recent years it has become apparent that the evolutionary relationships of prokaryotes are quite complex. One prokaryotic group, the Archaea, have some features that are more eukaryotic-like than prokaryotic-like. Although the Archaea lack a nucleus, their genetic organization is, in several important ways, more like that of a eukaryote.</p>

<p>To reconcile new data, the taxonomic scheme of life has been revised. The most current scheme proposes that life be divided into three domains. In this scheme prokaryotic organisms can belong to the domain&nbsp;<strong>Archaea</strong>&nbsp;or the domain&nbsp;<strong>Bacteria</strong>, while those organisms that have a nucleus comprise the third domain,&nbsp;<strong>Eukarya</strong>. Organisms that belong to each of these three domains are sometimes referred to as the archaebacteria, eubacteria and eukaryotes, respectively. This figure illustrates the relationship among the three domains. Keep in mind that the last universal common ancestor (<strong>LUCA</strong>) of life on earth most likely arose over 3.5 billion years ago. This organism probably had a fairly complex cell&nbsp;structure.</p>

<p>Archaea are sometimes referred to as&nbsp;<strong>extremophiles</strong>, and many species live in extreme environments (e.g., hot springs, salt ponds, Arctic ice, deep oil wells, acidic ponds that form near mines, and hydrothermal vents); however, these environments are not extreme to those archaea. In fact, many extremophiles die when moved to our more temperate environment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The archaea have several features that distinguish them from the bacteria.&nbsp;&nbsp; First, the archaea do not have the compound&nbsp;<strong>peptidoglycan</strong>&nbsp;associated with their cell membranes. Peptidoglycan is a polymer of sugars and amino acids that is unique to the bacteria.&nbsp; Secondly, the archaea have&nbsp;<strong>introns</strong>&nbsp;in some of their genes.&nbsp; Introns are intervening or non-coding sequences of DNA that are found in some archaea genes and the genes of eukaryotes (in contrast, <strong>exons</strong> are&nbsp;<span>segments of a DNA or RNA molecule containing information that codes for a protein).</span> Bacteria do not have introns. Thirdly, members of the archaea have unique lipids associated with their cell membranes (we will not focus on the characteristics of these lipids).</p>
