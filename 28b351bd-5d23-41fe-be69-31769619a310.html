<h2>Mendel and Modern Genetics Part 2 VoiceThread Transcript</h2>
<p>Slide 1<br>So let's remind ourselves what Mendel did to perform his crosses.&nbsp; He always started his P-generation with two true-breeding parents of opposite phenotype (in this example, purple vs. white).&nbsp; He would cross these two individuals to get the F1-generation which is comprised only of purple-flowered individuals. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Individuals from the F1 generation were self-fertilized to produce the F2 generation.&nbsp; The F2 generation was always comprised of purple and white-flowered plants in a 3:1 ratio.&nbsp; So if he counted 1000 offspring in the F2 - he would expect to find approximately 750 purple flowered plants and 250 white flowered plants.</p>
<p>Mendel did this cross many, many times and he always found the same results.&nbsp; He also did the same type of crosses with other traits in pea plants such as pea pod color, seed color, and seed texture.&nbsp; And in these crosses he also found the same results - all the F1-generation individuals had the same phenotype and the F2-generation showed two phenotypes in a 3:1 ratio.</p>
<p>These consistent results allowed Mendel to make some basic conclusions about the laws that govern inheritance.</p>
<p>Slide 2<br>So, what did Mendel conclude?&nbsp; First, we need to remember that Mendel was doing his work in the mid-1800s and the inheritance role of DNA was not discovered until the 1950s.&nbsp; So Mendel did not know about genes and alleles but he was able to infer their basic existence.&nbsp; In his writings, he did not use the terms genes and alleles or chromosomes and diploid - but I will use this modern terminology to discuss Mendel's conclusions.</p>
<p>His first conclusion was that each diploid individual has 2 copies of each gene - one coming from the female parent and one coming from the male parent.&nbsp; In this diagram, let's say the dark green chromosome has come from the dad and the light green chromosome has come from the mom.&nbsp; For genes a, b, c, d, and e - an individual has two copies.</p>
<p>Slide 3<br>His second conclusion was that if an individual inherits two different copies of a gene (2 different alleles), one will be dominant and one will be recessive.&nbsp; Remember, standard convention is to indicate a dominant allele with a capital letter and a recessive allele with a lowercase letter.&nbsp; If the 2 alleles are the same - the individual is referred to as homozygous and if the two alleles are different the individual is referred to as heterozygous.</p>
<p>Slide 4<br>Mendel's next conclusion was that recessive traits are only expressed if an individual inherits two copies of the recessive allele (is homozygous recessive).&nbsp; Remember, if an individual inherits even one copy of a dominant allele - the phenotype of that individual is dominant.&nbsp; The only way to express a recessive trait is to have two copies of the recessive allele.</p>
<p>Slide 5<br>Mendel also concluded that when an individual produces gametes (remember, gametes are either sperm or eggs) the alleles for a gene segregate into different gametes.&nbsp; This is known as Mendel's Law of Segregation.</p>
<p>Slide 6<br>To understand Mendel's Law of Segregation, you need to understand meiosis.&nbsp; Remember, during meiosis I the homologous chromosomes separate from each other.&nbsp; In this diagram from Tutorial 2 I have added gene labels from a hypothetical gene R.&nbsp; Our parent individual is heterozygous for gene R and the dominant R allele is found on the dark green chromosome and the recessive r allele is found on the light green chromosome.&nbsp; When these two chromosomes separate from each other during meiosis I, the alleles on these chromosomes also separate from each other.&nbsp; The result is that this individual makes 2 different types of gametes with respect to this gene - gametes with a big R and gametes with a little r.</p>
<p>Slide 7<br>It is important to also remember Mendel's Law of Independent Assortment.&nbsp; We were introduced to this idea in Tutorial 2.&nbsp; Let's look at it again with gene labels - this time we will use genes R and G.&nbsp; The original parent individual is heterozygous for both genes (RrGg).&nbsp; Gene R is on a different chromosome than gene G (gene R is on the green chromosomes and gene G is on the blue chromosomes).&nbsp; When the green pair of chromosomes lines up on the metaphase plate during metaphase I, they line up independently of the blue pair.&nbsp; The light green can line up with the light blue and the dark green with the dark blue.&nbsp; This alignment results in the production of gametes with the genotypes rg and RG.&nbsp; Alternatively, the light green chromosome can line up with the dark blue and the dark green with the light blue.&nbsp; This alignment results in the production of gametes with the genotypes rG and Rg.&nbsp; All together, an individual with genotype RrGg can produce four different gamete types - rg, RG, rG, Rg.</p>
<p>Slide 8<br>We have already learned that an individual can produce 2n different combinations of chromosomes during meiosis (where n=# of homologous pairs)</p>
<p>We can use this same basic idea to calculate the number of different allele combinations produced during meiosis<br>2n = # of different allele combinatinos where n=# of heterozygous genes.</p>
<p>Slide 9<br>So, let's try a few practice problems.&nbsp; This first problem asks you to determine the number of different chromosome combinations a fruit fly can make.&nbsp; The second two questions ask you to figure out the number of allele combinations an individual can make.&nbsp; Once you have answered these questions - access the next VoiceThread to see the solutions.<br>&nbsp;</p>
