<p>How does the cell use energy? The short answer is to do work. A cell does three types of work: mechanical (e.g., contracting muscle cells), transport (e.g., moving substances across the cell membrane), and chemical (e.g., non-spontaneous reactions between molecules; discussed in the next section). A major source of chemical energy for this work is&nbsp;<strong>adenosine triphosphate</strong>&nbsp;(ATP), which is illustrated in this figure.</p>

<p>ATP is a 5-carbon sugar (ribose) attached to a nitrogenous base (adenine; recall our discussion of the nucleotides DNA and RNA) and a group of three phosphates. The three phosphates are the triphosphate component of adenosine triphosphate, and they are very unstable. This instability is due to the three negative charges that create an intramolecular strain in one area of the molecule. Most reactions that involve ATP depend on the hydrolysis of the third phosphate to liberate the potential energy that can be used to do work. In addition to free energy that can do work, ADP (adenosine diphosphate) and inorganic phosphate (PO<sub>4</sub>; abbreviated P<em>i</em>&nbsp;or a circled P) are released during hydrolysis. The overall reaction is summarized in the figure below. The amount of energy that is made available to do work during this process is variable (depending on a number of factors, including temperature).</p>
<h3><br>How Does ATP Perform Work?</h3>
<p>[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3872|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__right__lightboxed]&nbsp;<br>Energy is made available from the hydrolysis of ATP to ADP + Pi. This energy provides energy for endergonic reactions. The many mechanisms that different reactions use to obtain energy from ATP are remarkable. Generally they all involve tapping into high-energy electrons found associated with the terminal phosphate group. The use of an exergonic (energy-releasing) process to drive an endergonic (energy-requiring) process is called&nbsp;<strong>energy coupling</strong>. There are many ways that this can be done. Examine how energy coupling can be used to allow an energetically unfavorable (<strong>non-spontaneous</strong>) reaction to take place.</p>
<p>Glutamine (an amino acid) synthesis&nbsp;is a thermodynamically&nbsp;unfavorable reaction:</p>
<ul><li>Glu + NH<sub>3</sub>&nbsp;----> Glu-NH<sub>2</sub></li></ul>
<p>The ΔG for this reaction is + 3.4 kcal/mol, therefore, it is a non-spontaneous reaction. However, this reaction does occur with the help of ATP. This is accomplished by coupling the removal of the terminal phosphate of ATP and the addition of ammonia to glutamic acid. In the first step, glutamic acid becomes an unstable phosphorylated intermediate when ATP is broken down. In the second step, ammonia displaces the phosphate group and glutamine is formed. This figure summarizes how ATP can be coupled to a reaction, such that an unfavorable reaction becomes exergonic.</p>
<p>The hydrolysis of ATP to ADP and Pi releases energy (-7.3 kcal/mol) in excess of the energy required (+3.4 kcal/mol) for the synthesis of glutamine. Therefore, the overall ΔG for the two-step process is -3.9 kcal/mol.</p>
<p>This type of energy coupling procedure is extremely important, and it allows many endergonic anabolic reactions to occur in the cell.</p>

<h2 id="EnergyI-Thermodynamics-ACautionaryNote">A Cautionary Note</h2>
<p>The field of thermodynamics has a novel history. It began in the 19th century when engineers were trying to understand how to make more efficient steam-driven engines. The discoveries in this area of science turned out to have an impact on other disciplines (a phenomenon frequently observed in science). The laws of thermodynamics apply to many situations that involve the interaction of matter and energy.</p>
<p>Perhaps in an effort to reach even greater levels of understanding, attempts have been made to apply the laws of thermodynamics to all situations. My kids once tried to talk me out of cleaning their room by citing the second law; it didn't work (but they did). There are even some popular books that have attempted to explain human societies using thermodynamics (e.g., all societies tend toward disorder unless energy is provided). These analogies can be attractive and can even be quite entertaining (e.g., search the internet for "Thermodynamics of Hell"). However, many of these efforts are flawed and unfounded. While reading, be watchful about how these laws can, and cannot, be reasonably applied.</p>
