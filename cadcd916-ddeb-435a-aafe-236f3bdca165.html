<p>The phenotype of an organism arises from the complex interactions of many character traits. In a monohybrid cross, the inheritance of one character is predicted. A testcross allows the determination of the genotype of a parent with a completely dominant phenotype (homozygous dominant and heterozygotes look the same). &nbsp;In a dihybrid cross two characters can segregate in several ways, with each leading to a different phenotype. How can one predict the likelihood of the different phenotypes from a dihybrid cross? This becomes relatively straightforward, providing each character trait behaves in a Mendelian fashion; that is, a simple dominant-recessive expression pattern. If the character traits are located on different chromosomes, they will segregate independently from each other. This means that the separate probabilities of each character trait can be predicted, as with a monohybrid cross. It follows then that the probabilities of these different phenotypes occurring simultaneously in the same plant will be the product of their probabilities occurring alone. &nbsp;Using the Rules of Multiplication and Addition will allow you to solve genetics problems without having to use a Punnett square, which becomes cumbersome even for a dihybrid cross.</p><p>In other words, if a purple/round seeded plant that is heterozygous for both characters is crossed with itself ("selfing"), then the probability of observing round/seeded progeny will be 0.75 x 0.75 = 0.56. Be sure that you understand the logic behind this prediction and how it was calculated. Also, if there are more than two ways a given genotype can arise, then the probability is the sum of each way it can arise.</p><p>Relatively few character traits are inherited in a simple Mendelian manner. There are a number of other basic patterns of inheritance that have been described, including incomplete dominance, codominance, multiple alleles, pleiotropy, epistasis and polygenic inheritance. These will be discussed in the next tutorial.</p>
