<p>A&nbsp;<strong>monohybrid cross</strong>&nbsp;involves the crossing of individuals and the examination of a single character (for example, flower color) in their offspring. The&nbsp;<strong>Punnett square</strong>&nbsp;is a useful tool for predicting the genotypes and phenotypes of offspring in a genetic cross involving Mendelian traits. Learn to construct&nbsp;a Punnett square by accessing the the web sites below.&nbsp;

<h2>
  <br>Interpreting the Results of a Punnett Square
</h2>
<p>The key to understanding Punnett squares is in realizing that the expected types of offspring are probabilities. The Punnett square is useful because it calculates the probability of producing each of the genotypes or phenotypes for any one offspring. Let's look at an example. A self-pollination of F<sub>1</sub>hybrids for flower color (<em>Pp</em>) gives a 3:1 ratio of purple:white flowers in the offspring. This means that 75% of the offspring are predicted to have purple flowers and 25% white flowers. It also means that for every offspring produced, that offspring has a 75% chance of having purple flowers and a 25% chance of having white flowers. Therefore, one would expect the number of offspring with a particular trait to be equal to the probability multiplied by&nbsp;<em>n</em>, the number of offspring. As you learned in the last tutorial, when working with ratios, if you are given the ratio and the total number of offspring counted you can convert the ratio to a probability and predict the number of offspring with each trait.
