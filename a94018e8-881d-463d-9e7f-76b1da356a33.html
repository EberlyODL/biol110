<p>This&nbsp;is a magnification of&nbsp;<em>Vibrio cholerae</em>, the organism responsible for cholera. Note the tail-like flagellum on one end; many prokaryotes are propelled by rotating flagella. The cellular and genetic organization of prokaryotes was introduced in our last tutorial. Recall that we also introduced their morphologies by discussing three basic shape categories of prokaryotes: cocci, bacilli, and spirilla. We will continue our discussion by exploring their metabolism, structure and movement.</p>
<p>By the end of this tutorial you should have a basic understanding of:</p>
<ul><li>Prokaryotic cell structure</li><li>Prokaryotic movement and responses to the environment</li><li>The different nutritional modes of prokaryotes</li><li>The diversity of prokaryotic carbon sources</li><li>Bioremediation</li></ul>
<p>Performance objectives:</p>
<ul><li>Diagram the structure of bacterial cell walls and describe how this relates to virulence</li><li>Identify the nutritional modes seen in prokaryotes and the sources of carbon that they can use</li><li>Describe the structure of the prokaryotic flagella</li><li>Discuss the different types of taxis and why this response is important</li><li>Explain the advantage of sporulation to prokaryotes</li></ul>
