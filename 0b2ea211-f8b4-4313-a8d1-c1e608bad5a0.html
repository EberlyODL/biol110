<p>There are many more species of flowering seed plants&nbsp;than nonflowering seed plants; more than 250,000 species of angiosperms have been described. A flower consists of four main parts: sepals, petals, stamens, and carpels

</p>
<p><strong>Sepals</strong>&nbsp;are the outermost, leaf-like parts of the flower.&nbsp; They are usually green but may be pigmented the same color as the petals.&nbsp;<strong>Petals</strong>&nbsp;are the next whorl of parts in from the sepals, and they are usually the structure that we think of when we talk about flowers. Petals are often brightly colored in plants that use pollinators to transfer pollen from one plant to another.&nbsp; However, plants can reproduce without petals or sepals because neither is a gamete-producing structure. The&nbsp;<strong>stamen</strong>&nbsp;is the male structure of a flower. It is made up of a slender&nbsp;<strong>filament</strong>&nbsp;and the pollen-producing&nbsp;<strong>anther</strong>&nbsp;carried on the filament. The&nbsp;<strong>carpel</strong>&nbsp;is the female structure. It is located in the center of the flower and consists of a&nbsp;<strong>stigma</strong>, a&nbsp;<strong>style</strong>, and an ovary. The term&nbsp;<strong>pistil</strong>&nbsp;describes the entire female reproductive structure and is composed of one or more carpels (in the figure above, the pistil is composed of one carpel). A pollen grain lands on the stigma (which often has a sticky surface), where it germinates, then the pollen tube grows through the style to an ovule, which is contained within the ovary. The ovule produces the egg cell. This is in contrast to the female cone of a nonflowering seed plant. Recall, in the nonflowering seed plant the pollen grain enters the micropyle and the pollen tube grows through the ovule tissue, but the ovule is not contained within an ovary.

<h2 id="PlantsIII-VascularFloweringPlants-TypesofFlowers">Types of Flowers
</h2>
<p>All flowers have stamens and/or carpels. In addition to these basic parts, a flower may have petals and/or sepals, or these structures can be absent, or fused. &nbsp;If a flower is bisexual, with both male and female reproductive parts (stamens and carpels), it is called a&nbsp;<strong>perfect flower</strong>&nbsp;(a plant that has perfect flowers can be called&nbsp;<strong>synoecious</strong>). If a flower is unisexual, having only one of these reproductive parts, either male or female, it is an&nbsp;<strong>imperfect flower</strong>. Imperfect flowers are further classified as staminate or carpellate (also pistillate), depending on the reproductive part that is present.
</p>
<p>Some plants (e.g., corn) have male flowers on one part of the plant (the tassels at the top) and female flowers on another part (the ears on the stalk). Plants such as these are called monoecious species. The word monoecious comes from the Greek words meaning "one house." When the staminate and carpellate flowers are found on separate plants, they are a dioecious species ("two houses"). Kiwi plants are an example of a dioecious species. Kiwi growers need to grow many female plants for fruit and some male plants for pollination

<h2 id="PlantsIII-VascularFloweringPlants-Pollination">Pollination
</h2>
<p>In order for a flowering plant to reproduce sexually, the male pollen must reach the female stigma in a process called&nbsp;<strong>pollination</strong>. Some plants pollinate via the wind; this is also the mechanism of pollination for most gymnosperms. You have seen the silk coming out of an ear of corn. These are the styles and stigmas of the female flowers. The male pollen is located at the top of the plant in the tassels, appropriately located for the wind to distribute the pollen.
</p>
<p>Some plants are pollinated by animals (e.g., bees and hummingbirds). Their flowers are specially colored and shaped to attract a specific pollinator. Bees are attracted to flowers that are white or yellow. In addition, flowers pollinated by bees tend to have sturdy petals to support the weight of a bee, and short stamens and carpels so that the pollen can transfer to and from the bee while it drinks the nectar. &nbsp;Hummingbird-pollinated flowers tend to be red, and the petals usually form a long tubular-shaped corolla. The hummingbird is attracted to the red color. When the hummingbird reaches its long beak into the corolla to eat the nectar, its forehead or throat contacts the stigma and/or anther to transfer pollen.
</p>
<p>The various relationships between flowers and their pollinators are good examples of&nbsp;<strong>coevolution</strong>. That is, the character of the flower is typically uniquely suited for a particular pollinator. One striking example occurs in flowers that are pollinated by flies. One flower, found in Malaysia, gives off a putrid smell of rotting meat that flies find quite appealing. This flower is not frequented by bees, nor do flies frequent the flowers that have smells that bees (and humans) prefer.
