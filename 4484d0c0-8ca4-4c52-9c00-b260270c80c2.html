<p>[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=2388|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__right__lightboxed]The adult human intestine is home to up to 100 trillion bacteria (this is 10x the number of cells that make up an adult human).&nbsp; It has been suggested that the human intestine achieves the highest cell densities of any ecosystem on earth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Recently we have discovered that the presence of these bacteria gives us metabolic capacities that we have not evolved for ourselves.&nbsp; For example,&nbsp;<em>Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron</em>&nbsp;is very good at digesting polysaccharides that we find indigestible.&nbsp; By breaking down these polysaccharides, they produce smaller compounds that our bodies can use for nutrients and energy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;When&nbsp;<em>Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron</em>&nbsp;escapes the gut, it can cause infections and abscesses in many parts of the body.&nbsp; Infection from&nbsp;<em>Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron</em>&nbsp;is an important side effect of abdominal surgeries and populations of the bacteria are almost universally resistant to penicillin.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Our symbiotic relationship with many of these gut bacteria has traditionally been referred to as commensalism.&nbsp; Our recent findings, however, suggest this is not correct and we need to update our understanding of our symbiotic relationships with our gut bacteria, including&nbsp;<em>Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron</em>.</p>
