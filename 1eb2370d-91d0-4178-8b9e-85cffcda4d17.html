<h2>Genetics Selection and Speciation Part 5 VoiceThread Transcript</h2>
<p>Slide 1<br>Reproductive isolation can be achieved either through prezygotic mating isolation or postzygotic mating isolation as we will now discuss.</p>
<p><br>Slide 2<br>Postzygotic isolating mechanisms refer to situations where a zygote forms but the embryo cannot survive and develop into a mature individual or an individual is born and survives to adulthood but cannot reproduce successfully by producing fertile offspring</p>
<p><br>Slide 3</p>
<p>Hybrid inviability refers to a situation where the genes from the two different species cannot function properly together and the embryo dies before birth.</p>
<p>This is seen in matings between sheep and goats. &nbsp;Sheep and goats are closely related but they cannot produce hybrids because of gene incompatibility which leads to loss of the embryo.</p>
<p><br>Slide 4<br>Hybrid Infertility refers to a situation where hybrid offspring are born but they cannot reproduce. &nbsp;</p>
<p>An example of this is when a donkey is crossed with a horse to produce a mule. &nbsp;Male donkeys have a diploid chromosome number of 62 (so their sperm contain 31 chromosomes) and female horses have a diploid chromosome number of 64 - so their eggs have 32 chromosomes. &nbsp;When a sperm with 31 chromosomes fertilizes an egg with 32 chromosomes - the result is that the zyogte has 63 chromosomes - an uneven number. &nbsp;The unpaired chromosome causes problems during meiosis and the mule usually cannot produce normal sperm or eggs.</p>
<p><br>Slide 5<br>But there are always exceptions. &nbsp;In 2007 a mule in Colorado named Kate gave birth to a foal (this has been documented a few other times as well).</p>
<p>So far, nobody can adequately explain how this happened - although researchers are working hard to figure out how a female mule can successfully reproduce.</p>
