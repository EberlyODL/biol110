<p><strong>Glycolysis</strong>&nbsp;involves the initial breakdown of glucose to&nbsp;<strong>pyruvate</strong>&nbsp;(or pyruvic acid), water, and reduced electron carriers (in this case NADH). The foods you eat are first broken down by your saliva, and then by enzymes in your stomach. Glucose, from your food, is then taken into your cells, and during glycolysis is split into two 3-carbon molecules of pyruvate. Glucose is not the only sugar used by your body; other sugars are either converted to glucose or introduced at other points in the glycolytic pathway. Likewise, fats and proteins can be used as energy sources. These foods are catabolized and the metabolic breakdown products enter the cellular respiratory pathway at various points. We will discuss the metabolism of glucose because it makes use of all the metabolic steps, and hence illustrates the complete process of cellular respiration.
</p>
<p>Glycolysis is initiated by the addition of a phosphate (P), from ATP, to a molecule of glucose; this destabilizes the glucose molecule and the bonds are then easily broken to release energy. So while there is a net gain of ATP in cellular respiration, some ATP is used to start the process.
</p>
<p>Glycolysis is a ten-step process, but all of the specific intermediate molecules and enzymes involved won't be discussed here. However, you should understand the general way in which ATP is produced during glycolysis. At two steps, a phosphorylated molecule (e.g., the substrate PEP) transfers a phosphate group to ADP. This&nbsp;<strong>substrate-level phosphorylation</strong>&nbsp;can only occur in the presence of a specific <strong>kinase</strong> enzyme (which differs according to the particular substrate that is donating the phosphate).&nbsp; Protein kinases are&nbsp;enzymes that catalyze&nbsp;the transfer of a high-energy phosphate groups one molecule&nbsp;to another.
</p>
<p>It takes two molecules of ATP to break down one molecule of glucose to pyruvate. The output is four ATPs and two NADHs. Therefore, there is a net gain of two ATPs and two NADHs from one molecule of glucose from glycolysis alone. Most of the energy remains in the pyruvate molecule.

<p>This figure&nbsp;shows the overall energy "balance sheet" for glycolysis. Note the initial "investment" of energy in the early stages, which requires 2 ATP molecules per molecule of glucose. In the later stages, 4 ATP molecules and 2 NADH molecules are produced, which yields a net production of 2 molecules of pyruvate, 2 molecules of ATP, and 2 molecules of NADH per molecule of glucose.

</h2>
<p>One of the products of the initial breakdown of glucose is pyruvate. Pyruvate is further modified and enters the next stages of cellular respiration (the Krebs cycle and the electron transport chain). It is at these stages that most of the ATP is produced for cellular work. Probably because of its connection to the production of chemical energy, pyruvate has become a very popular nutritional supplement among dieters and body builders. The merits of pyruvate are greatly disputed. For general interest, you may want to do a web search for "Pyruvate" for interesting comparisons of popular claims to actual research.
