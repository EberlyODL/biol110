<p>Although the&nbsp;<strong>euglenozoans</strong>&nbsp;are&nbsp;<strong>monophyletic</strong>&nbsp;(derived from a single ancestor), they are a diverse group in terms of their feeding strategies but all members have at least one flagellum (made of tubulin) with a unique rod structure.&nbsp; The unique ultrastructure of the flagella is the distinguishing characteristic of this kingdom (you do not need to know the details of these ultrastructural differences).&nbsp; Kingdom&nbsp;<strong>Euglenozoa</strong>&nbsp;includes heterotrophs, such as&nbsp;<em>Trypanosoma</em>, and autotrophs, such as&nbsp;<em>Euglena</em>. This kingdom can be divided into two groups. The first consists of&nbsp;<em>Euglena</em>&nbsp;and its relatives, collectively called the&nbsp;<strong>euglenoids</strong>. These organisms are primarily photosynthetic.</p>

<p style="clear: left;">The second group of euglenozoans is the&nbsp;<strong>kinetoplastids</strong>, which includes&nbsp;<em>Trypanosoma</em>&nbsp;and its relatives, all of whom have one large mitochondrion and an organelle called a&nbsp;<strong>kinetoplast</strong>, which stores extranuclear DNA. All kinetoplastids live in symbiosis with host organisms, and a number of them are pathogenic. For example, the disease African trypanosomiasis, or African sleeping sickness, is caused by euglenozoans from the genus&nbsp;<em>Trypanosoma</em>. African&nbsp;<em>Trypanosoma</em>&nbsp;species are transmitted between mammalian hosts by the tsetse fly, a biting insect that transfers the parasite from the blood of infected individuals to the blood of uninfected hosts. The symptoms of African sleeping sickness include fatigue and confusion, which results after&nbsp;<em>Trypanosoma</em>&nbsp;invades the central nervous system. This disease, although fatal if left unchecked, can be treated.</p>
<p>[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=2453|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__left__lightboxed]Another parasite from this same genus causes Chagas disease, or American trypanosomiasis, which is transmitted by insects known as "kissing bugs." Chagas disease, which occurs primarily in rural areas of Central and South America, affects between 8 and 11 million people and kills nearly 40,000 every year. It tends to be a chronic infection that causes acute symptoms (e.g., gastrointestinal discomfort and heart enlargement or other cardiac problems) between 10 and 20 years after infection.</p>
<p>There is some speculation that the debilitating fatigue and gastrointestinal distress that plagued Charles Darwin for the better part of his life after his return to England from South America was due to a chronic infection of Chagas disease.</p>
<p><br>Preventive measures for both African sleeping sickness and Chagas disease are largely focused on vector control, which ranges from insecticide-treated bednets (ITNs) to the "sterile insect technique" - a technology used to flood a wild population of insects with sterile individuals with the goal of reducing the insect population.</p>
