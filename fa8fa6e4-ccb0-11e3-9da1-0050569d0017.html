<p>As a sample is very unlikely to reflect the population exactly in all respects, there will always be some uncertainty as to how well the sample results reflect the population. You don&#39;t know the population mean, yet you would like to know it, which is why you need to draw your conclusion from the sample mean.</p>
<p>But besides calculating the sample mean, there is a need to access the precision (or spread) of the data to determine whether the calculated sample mean is an accurate estimate of the population mean.</p>
<p>Other simple statistical measures can be used to reduce or quantify the uncertainty, i.e. to measure the variability.</p>
<h2>VoiceThread: Standard Deviation</h2>
<p>The Standard Deviation is the most common measure of variability, measuring the spread of the data set and the relationship of the mean to the rest of the data--i.e. the precision of the data.</p>

<h2>Self-Check: Standard Deviation</h2>
<p>Test your ability to calculate the Standard Deviation using this self-check quiz.</p>

<p>Do you remember the million-dollar question of how many is enough for the sample to be representative of the population? The Standard Deviation can greatly help answer this question.</p>
<h2>Interactive Exercise: Sample Size and Standard Deviation</h2>
<p>Try this exercise where you can enter different sample sizes to see how the standard deviation changes depending on sample size.</p>
<p><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0" height="600" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="800"><param name="quality" value="high" /><param name="movie" value="https://online.science.psu.edu/sites/default/files/biol110/mod3less6samplesizestandarddev.swf" /><embed height="600" hspace="10" pluginspage="http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer" quality="high" src="https://online.science.psu.edu/sites/default/files/biol110/mod3less6samplesizestandarddev.swf" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" vspace="10" width="800"></embed></object></p>

<p>You will notice that as the sample size increases, the standard deviation generally decreases. This is because the more samples that you take, you are getting a better representation of the scatter in the data (i.e. increasing the number of samples that fit closer to the population mean, and eliminating the weight given to outlier values).</p>
<p>So, whenever possible, the more samples that can be taken the better. The bigger the sample size, the better the sample mean will approximate the population mean. While this is the ideal, logistical constraints in terms of time, manpower, cost, and ethics often factor in to the sample size used.</p>
<h2>Module 3 Wrap-up</h2>
<p>Congratulations, you have just gathered your first tools to put into the toolbox and you should now have a better understanding of the difference between samples and populations, as well as the ability to calculate the Mean and Standard Deviation. As such, you are well on your way to enhanced scientific understanding and discovery.</p>
