<p>We've concluded "part two" of our discussion on energy and cellular respiration, specifically by addressing redox reactions, NAD+ and glycolysis. You should be able to update "What Do We Know So Far?" with the following:</p><ul><li>Where glycolysis occurs in the cell</li><li>The reactants and products involved in glycolysis</li><li>The energy input and output of glycolysis</li><li>What is meant by substrate-level phosphorylation</li><li>How much ATP is produced in the absence of oxygen</li></ul><p>If you're comfortable with these concepts, it's time to complete the discussion of cellular respiration in the next tutorial.</p><p></p>
