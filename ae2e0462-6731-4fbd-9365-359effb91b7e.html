<p>The figure below&nbsp;illustrates the three basic body plans encountered in the bilateria: the acoelomates (e.g., flatworms, flukes, and tapeworms), the pseudocoelomates (e.g., roundworms, pinworms, hookworms and rotifers), and the coelomates (e.g., snails, clams, octopuses, earthworms, and leeches). Recall that&nbsp;pseudocoelomates differ from coelomates in that their body cavities are not completely lined by mesoderm-derived tissue, but instead have mesoderm only on one side, with endoderm on the other.</p>
