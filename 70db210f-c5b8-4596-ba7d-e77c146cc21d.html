<p>Constructing a Punnett square for a&nbsp;<strong>dihybrid cross</strong>&nbsp;(a cross following the inheritance of two traits) is similar to the method used for a monohybrid cross. Determine the alleles produced by each parent, draw the Punnett square, and then combine the gametes for each cell. The following web sites should help to demonstrate the process more clearly.</p>
<p>A helpful equation to use in solving genetics problems is to determine the number of different gamete types an individual can produce via meiosis. &nbsp;The equation is 2<sup>n</sup> = the # of different gamete types. &nbsp;In this equation, n is the number of heterozygous genes the individual has. &nbsp;For example, an individual of genotype AaBb can make 4 different gametes with respect to these two genes (gametes with genotype AB, Ab, aB, ab). &nbsp;An individual with genotype AABb only makes two different gamete types (AB and Ab).</p>
