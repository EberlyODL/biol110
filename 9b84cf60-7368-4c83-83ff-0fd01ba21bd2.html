<p>We have finished our discussion of photosynthesis by showing the major anabolic pathway that results in the reduction of carbon dioxide to G3P which can be used to synthesize various sugars (including glucose). The formation of sugars is energetically unfavorable, as can be predicted from the +Î”G for the formation of glucose from carbon dioxide and water. The energy and reducing power for this process comes from the light-dependent reactions, which were presented in the last tutorial.
</p>
<p>Carbon dioxide enters the Calvin cycle by being added to the 5-carbon compound called ribulose bisphosphate (RuBP). This reaction, involving the enzyme rubisco, results in a 6-carbon compound that is very unstable and is rapidly split into two, 3-carbon molecules. The resulting 3-carbon compound is activated by phosphorylation (via ATP obtained from the light-driven reactions of photosynthesis), then reduced by NADPH (again, obtained from the light-driven reactions of photosynthesis). After reduction, a 3-carbon molecule, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (G3P) exits the cycle. G3P has two fates. Some molecules go on to form more molecules of RuBP (which requires additional ATP; again derived from the light-driven photosynthetic reactions). Some molecules exit the Calvin cycle to form sugars (including glucose).
