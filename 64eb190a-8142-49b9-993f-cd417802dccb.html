<p>Not only did Morgan's work bolster a chromosome theory of heredity, it also initiated the study of sex-linked traits. Although the basis of sex determination in humans and fruit flies is similar (<em>XX</em>&nbsp;= female,&nbsp;<em>XY</em>&nbsp;= male), the same is not true of all organisms. In this figure the numerals represent the number of autosomes. In some insects sex is determined by the X-O system, in which females have two copies of the&nbsp;<em>X</em>&nbsp;chromosome and males only one. Therefore, the sex of the offspring will be determined by whether or not an&nbsp;<em>X</em>&nbsp;chromosome is present in the sperm that fertilizes the ovum. The Z-W system occurs in some birds, insects, and fish. In this system the chromosomes found in the ovum are variable (Z or W) Note: the figure is incorrect and sperm always contribute a&nbsp;<em>Z</em>&nbsp;chromosome. Here, it is the female (not the male) that determines the sex of the offspring. Bees and ants display a fourth type of sex determination, the haplo-diploid system. Females develop from fertilized eggs and are diploid, whereas males develop from unfertilized eggs and are haploid.
