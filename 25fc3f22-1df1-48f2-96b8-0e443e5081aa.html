[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=2279|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__left__lightboxed] Water exhibits <strong>cohesion</strong>. Cohesion is a physical property of particles or molecules of the same substance sticking together and water is cohesive due to hydrogen-bonding between neighboring water molecules. Due to cohesion, water has a high <strong>surface tension</strong> (resistance to disruption at the surface). This property is exploited by many insects (as seen in the image above) and some vertebrates (e.g., basilisk lizards), which can actually stand or run on water without breaking the surface and falling through.

<p>Water is a repository for heat due to its high <strong>specific heat</strong>. This means that it takes a relatively large amount of energy to raise the temperature of water. Therefore, water absorbs (and stores) heat energy more efficiently than many other substances. Biologically, this is extremely important because large bodies of water tend to have relatively stable temperatures, whereas the air around them may fluctuate. The moderate temperatures in oceans and large lakes make them suitable year-round for an abundance of aquatic life. Water also has a relatively high <strong>heat of vaporization</strong>, therefore, water is relatively resistant to phase changes. (It takes a relatively large amount of energy to break all of the H-bonds in water to produce water vapor or steam.) This property allows some organisms to use water, in the form of sweat, to cool down.</p>

<p>Water expands during freezing. When water molecules slow down and ice forms (below the freezing point), the hydrogen bonds stabilize and keep water molecules at a distance from each other in a characteristic, 3-dimensional crystal. As a results, ice is less dense than liquid water and ice floats. The distinction between ice and liquid water is illustrated in this figure.</p>
<p>Water is an excellent <strong>solvent</strong>, capable of dissolving many compounds. The polar character of water means that anything with a charge can dissolve in water. NaCl is table salt, and when added to water its sodium and chloride atoms disassociate. These ions have a charge. Both the positively charged sodium ions (Na+) and negatively charged chloride ions (Cl-) can readily bond to the polar water molecules and in doing so they dissolve. Compounds that dissolve readily in water are <strong>hydrophilic</strong>. Compounds that do not interact with water are <strong>hydrophobic</strong>.</p>
<p>There is an important class of molecules that have the unique ability to be both hydrophobic and hydrophilic, a property termed <strong>amphipathic</strong>. An amphipathic molecule has one end with some charge character, and the other end lacking charge. Phospholipid macromolecules are amphipathic. We will see the importance of these molecules in the discussion of phospholipids.</p>
<p>In conclusion, water has many important properties that are important to life. The cells of terrestrial organisms (including ours) contain greater than 70% water, and most cells are surrounded by water. This means that a large percentage of biomolecules operate in an aqueous compartment. It should not surprise you to learn that water plays an important role in the functioning of biochemicals. In the next few sections you will learn about four classes of biomolecules and about how their unique characteristics (and synthesis) involve water.</p><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="450" src="https://voicethread.com/app/player/?threadId=2120770" width="800"></iframe>
