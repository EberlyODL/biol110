<p>Slide 1<br>To understand genetics and be able to make predictions about genetic crosses, it is crucial that you understand meiosis.&nbsp; This diagram, from Tutorial 2, is an overview of meiosis.&nbsp; Make sure that you understand this diagram and the diagram of independent assortment from Tutorial 2 before you start to attempt genetics problems.</p>
<p>Slide 2<br>The most basic example of a genetic cross is a monohybrid cross.&nbsp; The prefix mono means one - so in a monohybrid cross we are tracking the inheritance of a single trait.&nbsp; We have already been introduced to monohybrid crosses when we looked at examples of Mendel's classic crosses. &nbsp;</p>
<p>When performing a genetic cross, we have a handy tool that we can use called a Punnett square.&nbsp; To create a Punnett square we first need to determine the different gamete types our parent individuals can make with respect to the gene that we are tracking.&nbsp; For example, we now know that the F1 individuals in Mendel's classic cross involving flower color are all heterozygous.&nbsp; Therefore, each F1 individual can make two different possible gamete types with respect to the gene for flower color - gametes with a P and gametes with a p.&nbsp; We construct our Punnett square by lining up these possible gametes along the axes of our square.&nbsp; So a female pea plant can produce two types of eggs - P and p.&nbsp; A male pea plant can produce two types of sperm - P and p.&nbsp; We write these gametes out along the axes of the square and then fill in the squares accordingly. &nbsp;</p>
<p>This Punnett square allows us to visualize the 3:1 phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation.&nbsp; Note, while the phenotypic ratio is 3:1 the genotypic ratio is 1:2:1.&nbsp; 1 homozygous dominant to 2 heterozygotes to 1 homozygous recessive.</p>
<p>The Punnett square allows us to visualize the cross and make predictions about offspring.</p>
<p>Slide 3<br>When an organism exhibits a dominant trait, we cannot know its genotype by simply looking at it.&nbsp; For example, this purple-flowered pea plant - we can't know whether it is homozygous dominant or heterozygous just by looking at it.&nbsp; But there is a way we can figure out its genotype.</p>
<p>Slide 4<br>A test cross allows us to determine the genotype of an organism of unknown genotype.&nbsp; To perform a test cross, it is typical to cross the individual of unknown genotype (and dominant phenotype) to an individual that is homozygous recessive.&nbsp; In this example, we don't know whether the purple flowered individual is homozygous dominant or heterozygoud.&nbsp; But we do know that a white-flowered individual has to be homozygous recessive.&nbsp; When we cross our unknown individual with our known individual - we can tell the unknown individual's genotype by analyzing the offspring.&nbsp; If all the offspring are purple, our unknown individual has the genotype PP.&nbsp; If half of the offspring are white and half purple, our unknown individual has the genotype Pp.&nbsp; Notice, this type of analysis only works with organisms that have large numbers of offspring.</p>
<p>Slide 5<br>We can increase the complexity of our genetic analysis by increasing the number of traits we are tracking.&nbsp; A dihybrid cross tracks the inheritance of two traits ("Di" means two).&nbsp; To understand this dihybrid cross, you must understand Mendel's Law of Independent Assortment.</p>
<p>In this example, we are tracking the inheritance of the alleles for seed color (yellow versus green) and seed shape (round vs. wrinkled).&nbsp; The P generation is comprised of true-breeding round, yellow individuals and true-breeding green, wrinkled individuals.&nbsp; The genes for these characters are found on different chromsomes so the genes assort independently of each other.</p>
<p>The F1 generation is all round, yellow - this tells us that round and yellow are the dominant traits (and green and wrinkled are recessive).&nbsp; When we self individuals from the F1 we see a 9:3;3:1 phenotypic ratio in the F2.</p>
<p>Note, in this example each parent can make 4 different possible gamete types (RY, Ry, rY, and ry).&nbsp; This means our Punnett Square is 4 x 4 or 16 squares large.</p>
<p>Slide 6<br>To understand how to set up the Punnett square - we need to understand how meiosis and independent assortment create the 4 different possible gamete types.&nbsp; This image shows a diagram of meiosis in an F1 individual from our previous cross.&nbsp; All F1 individuals are heterozygous (RrYy).&nbsp; Gene R is found on a different chromosome than gene Y so how gene R assorts into gametes is independent of how gene Y assorts.&nbsp; In this example, let's assume that gene R is on the green chromosome and gene Y is on the blue.&nbsp; There are two possible ways the chromosomes can align themselves at metaphase I - either light green with light blue and dark green with dark blue - resulting in RY and ry gametes OR light green with dark blue and dark green with light blue resulting in Ry and rY gametes.&nbsp; Therefore, our heterozygous F1 individuals make 4 different possible gamete types - RY, ry, Ry, and rY.</p>
<p>Slide 7<br>These are the four gamete types that we line up along the Punnett Square in our dihybrid cross.&nbsp; Then we fill in the squares (it is best to keep the Rs together and the Ys together) and determine the phenotypes.</p>
