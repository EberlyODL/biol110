<h2>Plants III Part 1 VoiceThread Transcript</h2><p>Slide 1</p><p>The angiosperms - otherwise known as the flowering plants - are the dominant plant group on earth today with approximately 275,000 known species.</p><p>The flower is the reproductive structure of the plant that is derived from modified leaves and plays an important role in pollination.</p><p>The seeds of the angiosperms are considered "housed" seeds because the seed is complete enclosed within an ovary - which is the fruit.</p><p>The fruit and flowers are responsible for the success of this group.</p><p>Slide 2</p><p>The flower contains either male reproductive structures, female reproductive structures, or both.</p><p><br>The male part of the flower is known as the stamen and it is comprised of the anther and the filament. &nbsp;The anther produces the pollen.</p><p><br>The female part of the plant is known as the carpel and is made up of the stigma, style, and ovary. &nbsp;The ovary houses the egg which will become fertilized to produce the zygote. &nbsp;After fertilization, the ovary will develop into the fruit and house the seeds.</p><p>The petals of the flower typically are colorful and attract animal pollinators.</p><p>Slide 3</p><p>The flowers are the reproductive structure of the angiosperms and they can be classified as either perfect - which means they have both male and female parts on the same flower or imperfect - which means the flower has either male or female parts but not both.</p><p>Many species of angiosperm take advantage of animals for pollination and seed dispersal (including humans)</p><p>This ability to take advantage of animals is what has made the angiosperms so succesful.</p><p><br>Slide 4</p><p>When pollen lands on the stigma it grows a pollen tube into an ovule where it deposits two sperm nuclei - this is a process known as double fertilization.&nbsp;</p><p>Slide 5</p><p>Pollination is the process of moving pollen from one plant to another and, in the angiosperms, it often involves an animal pollinator.</p><p>Slide 6</p><p>Not all angiosperms take advantage of animal pollinators. &nbsp;Some use the wind for pollination. &nbsp;<br>Characteristics of wind pollinated plants include that they produce large amounts of pollen, and small inconspicuous flowers. &nbsp;</p><p>Pollen travels <100 meters so wind pollinated plants must grow close together</p><p>Trees (oaks) and grasses are often wind pollinated.</p><p>Slide 7</p><p>Wind pollination is a wasteful process - if the wind blows the wrong way - all that pollen and all that reproductive effort is wasted.</p><p><br>Slide 8</p><p><br>Animal pollinated plants produce smaller amounts of pollen.</p><p>Instead of putting energy into abundant pollen production they put their energy into producing large, showy flowers - these flowers attract pollinators, often give a them a reward - such as nectar.</p><p>Pollinators can carry pollen large distances so animal pollinated plants can be widely separated.</p><p><br>Slide 9<br>All kinds of animals can be pollinators - insects, birds and even mammals.</p><p>The features of the flower fit the pollinator. &nbsp;Insects tend to be attracted to yellow flowers with flat surfaces for landing. &nbsp;Birds are attracted to red and hummingbirds hover in front of the flower and don't need to land.</p><p>Bats are active at night so bat-pollinated plants are typically white and highly scented.</p><p>Some plants even attract beetles and flies as pollinators - this flower is the color of meat and has the pungent odor of rotting flesh - beetles anf flies love it!</p><p>Slide 10</p><p>Some plants take advantage of animals but do not give them a reward. &nbsp;Orchids in the genus Ophrys are wasp and bee mimics. &nbsp;They produce pheromones that mimic the pheromones of a female and they even look like a female. &nbsp;</p><p>Male wasps come and attempt to copulate with the flower. &nbsp;In the process they pick up pollen and then deliver it to another flower. &nbsp;</p><p>They do not get any nectar or other food. &nbsp;</p><p>These orchids are parasites. &nbsp;They essentially steal reproductive energy from the wasps.&nbsp;</p>
