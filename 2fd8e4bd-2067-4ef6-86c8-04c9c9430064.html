<p>Modern land plants share some features with the group of green algae called&nbsp;charophytes, and charophytes are the closest relatives of the plant kingdom.</p>

<p>This phylogenetc tree depicts the evolutionary relationships between charophytes and plants. It is thought that the first true plants were derived from a charophyte. This means that the ancestor of all modern plants was a green algae living in an aquatic environment. There are many lines of evidence (e.g., chemical, structural, and genetic data) for the close evolutionary relationship between charophytes and plants.<br>&nbsp;Chlorophytes (green algae) have the same photosynthetic pigments found in plants. Chlorophyll a is common to other photosynthetic organisms, but chlorophyll b is shared only by green algae and plants. Characters such as a cell wall composed primarily of cellulose, storage of carbon in the form of starch, and formation of a cell plate at cytokinesis are not limited to green algae and plants; however, these shared characters provide further evidence of their relatedness. Molecular evolutionary analyses of RNA and DNA sequence data from green algae and plants also clearly place these two groups together.</p>

<p>Despite the similarities between charophytes and plants, plants are classified in a separate kingdom (Plantae). Charophytes are adapted to an aquatic environment, and the features that distinguish members of the plant kingdom from charophytes are their adaptations to a terrestrial environment.<br>&nbsp;</p>

<p>All eukaryotes that reproduce sexually have both a haploid and diploid stage in their life cycle. Although there is great variety in modes of reproduction among algae, some algaes (Brown, Red and Green) have a life cycle that includes alternation of generations; this type of life cycle is also found in plants.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Alternation of generations</strong>&nbsp;refers specifically to a life cycle that includes the alternation between multicellular haploid life stages and multicellular diploid life stages. Diploid forms (<strong>sporophytes</strong>) produce haploid spores, which divide and develop directly into multicellular haploid structures (<strong>gametophytes</strong>). Gametophytes then produce haploid gametes, which join with other gametes through fertilization to form diploid sporophytes once again. The diploid and haploid generations alternate, over and over. In some organisms the diploid stage is the dominant form that is responsible for the majority of growth and resource acquisition, whereas in others the haploid stage is dominant. &nbsp;We will consider the life cycle of each of the four major groups of plants, in particular the prominence of the gametophyte versus the sporophyte, and the dependence of these forms on each other.</p>

<p>It is important to remember that ancestral plants had many more shared features with charophytes than those of modern plants. They would have been transitional between the green algae and the plants in existence today. The environment they occupied was most likely subject to periods of drying, such that they slowly evolved features that allowed them to exist in a terrestrial rather than aquatic environment. This theme of adaptation to environmental conditions, via natural selection, is very important in the study of plant evolution.</p>
<p>Fossil plant remains that clearly show features of true plants date back to at least 475 million years ago. The fossil record provides small windows into the past, and it aids scientists in approximating what life forms existed during a certain period in time. Because it can take millions of years for evolutionary changes to become established and because it is more rare than common for fossilization to occur, scientists estimate that the earliest plants began to evolve prior to the first evidence of plants in the fossil record. In fact, some molecular evidence indicates that land plants could have appeared as early as 600 million years ago.</p>
