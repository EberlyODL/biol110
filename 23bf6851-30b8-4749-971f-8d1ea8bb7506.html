<p>Slide 1<br>Meiosis is cell division for reproduction.&nbsp; It is a process by which genetic variation is created and maintained.</p>
<p>During meiosis, one diploid cell give rise to four haploid cells.&nbsp; These resulting haploid cells are genetically different from the original parent cell and from each other.</p>
<p>The process of meiosis occurs in two stages - meiosis I and meiosis II. &nbsp;</p>
<p>There are two important features of meiosis that produce genetic variation - crossing-over during Prophase I of meiosis I and independent assortment of homologous chromsomes during metaphase I of meiosis I.</p>
<p>Slide 2<br>Most of the important stuff in meiosis occurs in meiosis I.&nbsp; Just as in our study of mitosis, we are not concerned with details about the cell - we just want to understand the movement and behavior of the chromosomes.</p>
<p>There are a few key events in meiosis that do not occur in mitosis.&nbsp; The first is that the homologous chromosomes synapse or attach to each other during Prophase I - this does not happen in mitosis.</p>
<p>While the homologous chromsomes are physically connected to each other during synapsis, a process known as crossing over takes place.&nbsp; This is a physical exchange of genetic material between non-sister chromatids.&nbsp; This does not happen in mitosis.</p>
<p>During metaphase I, the synapsed or connected chromosomes line up together along the metaphase plate - this also does not occur during mitosis.</p>
<p>Finally, during anaphase I, it is the homologous chromosomes that separate - not the sister chromatids as in mitosis.</p>
<p>Slide 3<br>Let's look at the process of crossing-over.&nbsp; During prophase I of meiosis I, the homologous chromosomes pair up and physically connect to each other.&nbsp; During this time, crossing-over takes place.&nbsp; Crossing-over is the physical exchange of DNA between non-sister chromatids.&nbsp; This process results in genetically unique chromosomes.&nbsp; Crossing over is not a mistake or a mutation - it is a part of normal cell division via meiosis.</p>
<p>Slide 4<br>We can look at a diagram of meiosis I (which is also known as reduction division because it is during meiosis I that the ploidy level of the resulting cells is reduced to haploid).&nbsp; In this diagram, we can see the homologous chromosomes pairng and crossing over during prophase I.&nbsp; During metaphase I, the homologous pairs line up at the metaphse plate.&nbsp; And during Anaphase I, the homologous chromsomes separate from each other.&nbsp; This is the reduction event.&nbsp; Remember, in mitosis it is the sister chromatids that separate during anaphase.&nbsp; In meiosis I it is the homologous chromosomes that separate from each other. One member of the pair moves to one pole, and the other member moves to the other pole.&nbsp; During telophase I the cell will divide to produce two haploid cells - there is only one copy of each type of chromosome in the resulting daughter cells.&nbsp; The chromosomes, however, are still in the replicated state.&nbsp; During meiosis II the sister chromatids will separate. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Slide 5<br>Meiosis II looks very much like mitosis in a haploid cell.&nbsp; In this diagram, we are seeing meiosis II in the two cells that resulted from meiosis I in the preceeding diagram.&nbsp; Note that there has been no DNA replication between meiosis I and meiosis II.&nbsp; During metaphase II the chromosomes line up at the metaphase plate and during anaphase II the centromeres split and the sister chromatids separate from each other.&nbsp; During telophase II the cells divide and we see the 4 haploid cells that result from a full round of meiosis.&nbsp; Note that the color coding of the chromosomes demonstrates the genetic variation that has been produced - none of the 4 cells has the same genetic makeup.&nbsp; Genetic variation has been generated by meiosis. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Slide 6<br>Meiosis produces genetic variation in two ways.&nbsp; The first is crossing over which we have already looked at.&nbsp; The second is a process known as independent assortment.&nbsp; Independent assortment is a bit confusing - you should print out and look closely at the diagram of independent assortment from this tutorial.&nbsp; During metaphase I, the paired homologous chromosomes align along the metaphase plate. How one pair of chromosomes aligns along the plate is independent of how another pair aligns.&nbsp; When the chromosome pairs separate during anaphase I, indpendent assortment occurs.&nbsp; This process results in different combinations of chromosomes and we can use an equation to calculate the different number of combinations.&nbsp; The equation is 2 raised to the nth power where n equals the number of homologous pairs.</p>
<p>Slide 7<br>We can visualize independent assortment with this image from the tutorial.&nbsp; This diagram shows a simple cell with two different homologous pairs of chromosomes.&nbsp; The left side of the diagram shows one possible arrangement of chromosomes and the right the other possible arrangement (the colors indicate different chromosomes - in this diagram let's say that light green is the maternal chromosome - or the chromosome inherited from the female parent and the dark green is paternal - or inherited from the male parent - the same color coding applies to the blue pair - light blue from mom and dark blue from dad). On the left the chromosomes line up on the metaphase plate with the light blue and light green aligned on one side and dark blue and dark green aligned on the other. When the cell goes through meiosis it produces two different types of daughter cells - one type that has both maternal light colored chromosomes and one type that has both paternal dark colored chromsomes.&nbsp; On the right hand side we see that there is another way for the chromosomes to align along the metaphase plate.&nbsp; They can align so that the light green is on the same side as the dark blue and the dark green is on the same side as the light blue.&nbsp; When the cell goes through meiosis, it produces two different types of daughter cells - those with a dark green and light blue chromosome and those with a light green and dark blue chromosome.&nbsp; Overall, this original parent cells with two homologous pairs of chromosomes can produce four different possible types of chromosomes.&nbsp; This is independent assortment and it generates genetic variation.</p>
<p>Slide 8<br>So a cell with 2 homologous pairs can produce 4 different possible gamete types.&nbsp; What about humans?&nbsp; We have 23 pairs of chromosomes.&nbsp; How much genetic variation does independent assortment produce in us?</p>
<p>Slide 9<br>To answer this question, we need to remember our equation of 2 raised to the nth power where n is the number of homologous pairs.&nbsp; Note: n is the number of pairs - not the total number of chromosomes.&nbsp; In humans, n equals 23.&nbsp; So the total number of chromosome combinations produced by independent assortment in humans is 2 raised to the 23rd power - or number greater than 8 million.&nbsp; This is a lot of genetic variation!</p>
<p>Slide 10<br>Our discussion of independent assortment did not include crossing over.&nbsp; When we add crossing over into the picture - meiosis generates even more genetic variation.&nbsp; Essentially, the genetic variation in a population as a result of independent assortment and crossing over is infinite! &nbsp;</p>
