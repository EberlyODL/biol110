<p>This tutorial examined the consequences of gene linkage and how crossing over in meiosis can alter the segregation pattern of genes that are located on the same chromosome. During Prophase I, homologous chromosomes pair up, gene-for-gene. Occasionally this pairing leads to breakage and rejoining of regions of homologous chromosomes. In other words, portions of a maternally derived chromatid can exchange and become physically connected with regions of a paternally derived chromatid (and vice-versa). Any gene located on either side of this &nbsp;break point will become unlinked. The absolute point where crossover occurs cannot be predicted with certainty (although some regions of the chromosome are more prone to this than others); however, the greater the distance that two genes are from one another on the same chromosome, the greater the likelihood that crossing over will occur between them.</p><p>If the probability for crossing over increases proportionately with the distance between two linked genes, then the frequency at which they become unlinked (due to crossovers) is an indirect measure of how far apart these genes are from one another. If you don't understand why this is so, you might find it helpful to draw a couple of cartoons of chromosomes with two hypothetical genes at different distances from one another. Draw one set with the two genes 1/2 inch apart, and the other set with them one inch apart. If, on average, a crossover occurs once every four inches, then 25% of the time the two genes located one inch apart will become unlinked. However, the two genes located 1/2 inch apart will only become unlinked 12.5% of the time.</p><p>The relationship between gene distance and recombination frequency can be used to map the relative location of a gene on a chromosome. Be sure that you understand the logic behind this process that allows geneticists to map the relative order of genes on a chromosome.</p>
