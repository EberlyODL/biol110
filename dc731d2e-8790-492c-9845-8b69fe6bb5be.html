<h2>DNA Replication Part 2 VoiceThread Transcript</h2><p>Slide 1<br>This question is asking you to orient yourself to the polarities of the two strands of the DNA molecule. &nbsp;The easiest way to approach this problem is to look for the DNA polymerase.</p><p><br>Slide 2<br>The DNA polymerase is always at the 3' end of the newly synthesized DNA. &nbsp;Each piece of nucleic acid has a 3' and a 5' end - note that there are several molecules of DNA polymerase found on this diagram so we can orient ourselves in several different places. &nbsp;The opposite end of the strand is the 5' end and the 3'end of one strand must align with the 5' end of another strand.</p><p>Slide 3<br>This question requires you to use both the polarity rules and the base-pairing rules. &nbsp;First, we have to align the 5' end of the given strand with the 3' end of its complimentary strand. &nbsp;Then we need to use the base-pairing rules.</p><p><br>Slide 4<br>Using the polarity and base-pairing rules we see that A is the correct answer. &nbsp;The 5' end of the given strand aligns with the 3' end of the A strand. &nbsp;Then we see that A base pairs with T, C with G, A with T, and so on.</p><p><br>Slide 5<br>This question is similar to the previous question but now the possible answers are written 5' to 3'. &nbsp;Remember, DNA molecules are 3-dimensional and can be oriented in any way. &nbsp;However, when they physically connect to each other they need to be paired 5' to 3' and 3' to 5'.</p><p>So to answer this question you need to align the 5' end of the given strand with the 3' end of the complimentary strand.</p><p><br>Slide 6<br>The correct answer to this question is B. &nbsp;When you align the 5' end of the given strand with the 3'end of the answer - you can then use the base-pairing rules to find the complimentary strand.</p><p>Please let me know if you have any questions about these practice problems.</p>
