<p>At one time, <strong>slime molds</strong>&nbsp;were classified with the fungi because of their heterotrophic feeding habits and appearance.&nbsp; Further study of these organisms has shown that they are members of the Kingdom&nbsp;<strong>Amoebozoa</strong>, which includes the familiar protist <em>Amoeba</em>. Kingdom Amoebozoa is characterized by the presence of pseudopodia that are used for locomotion and feeding.&nbsp; The similarities between slime molds and fungi arose independently and are an example of convergent evolution, as we saw with oomycetes and fungi.&nbsp;Myxomycetes, or&nbsp;plasmodial slime molds, are among the most bizarre and beautiful organisms on Earth, often brilliantly colored in shades of yellow, orange, or pink. They &nbsp;can be very large and have given some gardeners a scare when found growing on a damp pile of bark mulch. Despite their size, plasmodial slime molds are unicellular; they are large bags of cytoplasm. However, within each "cell" are many nuclei. The synchronous division of these nuclei has made slime molds very useful research organisms for the study of mitosis; additionally, many scientists study cytoplasmic streaming (the circular flow of cytoplasm that aids in moving materials within the cell) in myxomycetes because it is a relatively easy phenomenon to observe due to the size of these organisms.</p>[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=2505|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__right__lightboxed]
<p>Acrasiomycetes, or&nbsp;cellular slime molds, are also unusual organisms. They spend most of their lives as amoeba-like single cells, but when resources are scarce they converge, joining with other cells to form units that have coordinated functions, as seen in multicellular organisms. Unlike plasmodial slime molds, the cells within the acrasiomycetes retain their cell membranes and their ability to live independently. Cellular slime molds have been used as a model system for scientists studying the behaviors of individual cells and coordination among groups of cells. Researchers studying these organisms have an active online community, Dictybase, providing a resource for the hundreds of scientists working on the cellular slime mold&nbsp;<em>Dictyostelium</em>.&nbsp;</p>
