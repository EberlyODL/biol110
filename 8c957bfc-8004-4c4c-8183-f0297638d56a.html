<p>This figure depicts a small number of the metabolic pathways in a cell. Dots represent molecules, and lines represent chemical reactions. The straight line of large dots down the center is the catabolic breakdown of carbohydrates (glycolysis), and the large ring towards the bottom is the citric acid (or Krebs) cycle.</p>
<p><strong>Metabolism</strong>&nbsp;refers to all of the chemical reactions that occur in an organism. Metabolic reactions can be categorized into those that result in the formation of polymers and other large molecules (anabolic) and those that result in the breakdown of molecules (catabolic). Anabolism and catabolism were discussed in Tutorial 3. During photosynthesis, photoautotrophs (e.g., plants) convert the energy found in sunlight into chemical energy via a series of anabolic reactions that result in the production of carbohydrates, including starch. Chemoheterotrophs (e.g., humans) eat starch and break it down via a series of catabolic reactions to obtain the stored chemical energy. Before we discuss how these chemical reactions are used to move energy around the biosphere (and why), we need to define energy.</p>
<p><strong>Energy</strong>&nbsp;refers to that which can or does move matter (i.e., the capacity for doing work).&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Kinetic energy</strong>&nbsp;refers to energy that is associated with moving matter.&nbsp;<strong>Potential energy</strong>&nbsp;refers to energy that is stored. Work is the act of moving matter, whether that matter is as small as an electron or as large as a whale.</p>

<p>Examples of potential and kinetic energy are all around us. For example, the Hoover Dam on the Colorado River&nbsp;blocks the normal flow of water and stores potential energy behind its walls. When released, the kinetic energy of the swiftly flowing water is harnessed to provide electricity for 1.3 million people a year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is also a connection between kinetic energy and temperature. The temperature of an object is a reflection of the kinetic energy of its atoms or molecules. Fast molecules = high kinetic energy = high temperature. Boiling water has a much higher temperature, and subsequently a higher kinetic energy than ice.</p>
<h2 id="EnergyI-Thermodynamics-EnergyandChemicalBonds">Energy and Chemical Bonds</h2>
<p>To understand how metabolic reactions are used to transform energy from one form to another, one needs to appreciate some basics about the physical forces that allow two atoms to interact. Chemical bonds hold atoms together, and these bonds form as a result of electron behavior (either directly or indirectly). Electrons have mass, hence their movement requires energy. In addition, electrons contain varying amounts of potential energy. In the vast majority of metabolic reactions, it is the electrons that are the vehicle for moving energy. How does this happen?</p>
<p>Let's start with a common chemical reaction.</p>
<ul><li>Methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) + 2 oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) ----> Carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) + 2 water (H<sub>2</sub>O)</li></ul>
<p>This reaction takes place every time you turn on a gas stove. The reaction gives off energy in the form of heat and can be used to do work (e.g., boil water). In this reaction the chemical bonds associated with the four hydrogen atoms around the carbon atom must break, then associate with the electrons associated with oxygen. Note that it takes energy to break bonds; in this case, 632 kcal of energy are required for every mole of methane that reacts with two moles of oxygen.</p>
<p>If energy is required, how does this reaction evolve heat energy?</p>
<p>The answer is that bond formation produces heat. In this example, 792 kcal of energy evolve as the new bonds form in association with oxygen. The net gain is 792 - 632 = 160 kcal/mole of energy released by the reaction.</p>
<p>Before ending this topic, let's clarify some case-sensitive nomenclature. In everyday usage, energy is often written in Calories (Cal, note the uppercase "C"), otherwise known as Nutritional Calories. 1 Calorie = 1,000 calories, or 1 kcal = 1 Calorie.&nbsp; A calorie (with a lowercase "c") is the amount of energy required to raise the temperature of 1 gram of water by 1Â° Celsius.</p>
