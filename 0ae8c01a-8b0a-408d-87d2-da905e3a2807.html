<p id="ProkaryotesI-CellularandGeneticOrganization-AsexualReproductionandtheTransferofGeneticInformationBetweenProkaryotes">Prokaryotes do not alternate between the haploid and diploid states, so meiosis and fertilization are not found in the prokaryote life cycle. Rather, binary fission is the main method of reproduction in prokaryotes. This form of asexual reproduction means that the genetic variation created by meiosis and random fertilization does not occur in prokaryotes. Nonetheless, genetic variation does occur in prokaryotes, and mutations are one source of variation in a population. Genetic variation within a population can be beneficial because it provides the raw materials for a population to adapt to a changing environment. Greater diversity in the gene pool increases the likelihood that at least some of the organisms in a population will have the right genetic combination to survive if environmental conditions change.</p>
<p>We will discuss three ways in which prokaryotes transfer genes between individuals (transformation, conjugation, and transduction).&nbsp; All three of these gene transfer mechanisms are collectively referred to as <strong>horizontal gene transfer</strong> to differential them from the vertical gene transfer typical of most eukaryotes in which genes are only passed from parent to offspring.</p>
<h2 id="ProkaryotesI-CellularandGeneticOrganization-Transformation">Transformation</h2>
<p>One way that genetic material can be moved between bacteria is&nbsp;<strong>transformation</strong>. Transformation occurs when prokaryotes acquire genes from their surrounding environment. This DNA might have been left behind by other bacteria (from the same or different species) when they died. The foreign DNA is directly taken up by the cell and expressed. If the DNA contains a beneficial gene (e.g., one encoding for antibiotic resistance), then the individuals harboring that gene will have a selective advantage over their non-transformed counterparts. As long as individuals with this gene reproduce more successfully, compared to those lacking the gene, they will be more fit and the gene will increase in frequency (i.e., microevolution, via natural selection, will occur).</p>
<p>Other examples include transformation of nonpathogenic bacteria into&nbsp;<strong>pathogenic</strong>&nbsp;(harmful) strains. When harmless&nbsp;<em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em>&nbsp;bacteria are placed in a medium containing dead cells of the pathogenic strain, they can take up the DNA from the dead pathogenic cells. If the formerly harmless bacteria pick up the gene for pathogenicity, they will become pathogenic themselves. It is important to point out that pathogenicity may not confer a long-term increase in fitness; if the host dies, the microsymbiont has lost its' "home". As such, it is often said that the "smartest" pathogens are those that cause the lowest mortality.</p>
<h2 id="ProkaryotesI-CellularandGeneticOrganization-Conjugation">Conjugation</h2>
<p>Genetic material can also move between bacteria by&nbsp;<strong>conjugation</strong>. The mechanism of conjugation requires that two living prokaryotic cells physically join with one another. Typically DNA transfer only goes one way, with the "male" using an appendage called a&nbsp;<strong>pilus</strong>&nbsp;(plural, pili). In order to produce pili, prokaryotes must have a plasmid termed the&nbsp;<strong>F factor</strong>(fertility factor plasmid). When a cell has the F factor plasmid, it is said to be F+. This F+ condition is heritable. If an F+ cell divides, both of the resulting cells will be F+. This condition is also "contagious." After an F+ cell conjugates with a "female" cell that does not contain the F factor, the "female" cell obtains the F factor plasmid and becomes F+ ("male").</p>

<h2 id="ProkaryotesI-CellularandGeneticOrganization-Transduction">Transduction</h2>
<p>Genetic material can also be moved between bacteria by&nbsp;<strong>transduction</strong>. In this event, the exchange of DNA between prokaryotes is made possible by&nbsp;<strong>phages</strong>(viruses that infect bacteria). Phages reproduce by injecting their genetic material inside the bacterial cell, then multiplying, and eventually bursting from the cell. In transduction, the phage DNA inserts somewhat benignly into the bacterial host chromosome. Here it can lay dormant for many generations. However, under certain conditions, the phage DNA removes (excises) itself from the bacterial chromosome (usually carrying pieces of the chromosome with it), then replicates and forms new phages that burst out of the cell. These phages can reinfect other bacteria and thereby transfer not only their own DNA, but pieces of the former host DNA into the newly infected bacterium.</p>

<h2 id="ProkaryotesI-CellularandGeneticOrganization-GeneticVariationandEvolution">Genetic Variation and Evolution</h2>
<p>The short generation time associated with binary fission was pointed out earlier in this tutorial. We also know that mutations add new and different alleles to populations. These two factors (short generation times and mutations), combined with the processes of conjugation and transduction, help prokaryotic populations achieve vast genetic variation (without the alternation of haploid/diploid states seen in many eukaryotes). Generation times are minutes to hours, and can result in a beneficial mutation being heavily favored and passed on to a great number of offspring in a very short period of time. Once again, a short generation span enables prokaryotic populations to adapt very rapidly to environmental change. This adaptive evolution is as important now to prokaryotes as it was when prokaryotic life began to diversify a few billion years ago.</p>
