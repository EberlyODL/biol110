<p>Many prokaryotes are capable of directional movement, and some can actually move quite quickly, up to 100 times their body length in one second. (Think about this in terms of human movement; if a running person has a six-foot stride, this translates to over 400 miles per hour!)</p>
<p>Some prokaryotes can secrete slimy chemicals and then glide around on them. Some helical bacteria, the spirochetes, have internal filaments that are arranged so that the whole organism rotates axially; because the organism is helical in shape, the resulting movement is similar to the action of a corkscrew. The most common type of movement in prokaryotes is through flagellar action. A&nbsp;flagellum&nbsp;(plural, flagella) is a long appendage specialized for locomotion, and while both eukaryotes and prokaryotes may exhibit flagellar motion, the flagella of prokaryotes are different structurally from those of eukaryotes.</p>

<p>Bacterial flagella can rotate either clockwise or counterclockwise. When rotating clockwise, the flagella fly apart, causing the bacteria to tumble randomly. When rotating counterclockwise, the flagella are drawn together into a bundle that results in directional movement. Bacteria with flagella alternate between tumbling and directional movement. In some cases the movement is random, but in other cases there is an oriented movement (<strong>taxis</strong>) toward or away from a stimulus.</p>

<p>Prokaryotes (and eukaryotes) that exhibit taxis typically respond to some environmental cue. If the cue is a chemical, such as a carbon source, then the organism typically responds in a positive manner and moves toward the source in a response referred to as positive chemotaxis. Conversely, if the chemical is noxious, then the organism typically responds in a negative manner and moves away from the source in a process known as negative chemotaxis. Other environmental cues are also used (e.g., light, gravity, and magnetism). What type of taxis is a motile bacterium&nbsp; displaying when it moves toward light?</p><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="450" src="https://voicethread.com/app/player/?threadId=2128487" width="800"></iframe>
