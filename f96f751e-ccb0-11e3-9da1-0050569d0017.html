<p>In order for cells to give rise to new cells, all genetic information and cellular contents must be replicated. This tutorial will focus on the cell division in eukaryotic cells known as mitosis.&nbsp; Mitosis is cell division for growth and repair in multicellular organisms.&nbsp; By the end of this tutorial you should have a basic working understanding of:</p>

Although <strong>mitosis</strong> is the process by which cell division occurs, many events need to take place prior to the physical separation of a mother cell into two daughter cells. Mitosis is a highly orchestrated process, with many checkpoints that insure events occur in the proper sequence. However, cells only divide at certain times and in specific situations.</p>
	<p>All of the components of a cell must be replicated prior to cell division (only a fraction of the components are shown in this figure of an animal cell). The replication of new components is highly regulated. Only if the cell receives the proper signal (the nature of which is dependent on the particular cell and the environment in which it exists), will<a class="highslide lightbox-processed" href="https://online.science.psu.edu/sites/default/files/biol110/Tutorial25_cell_cycle.jpg" rel="lightbox[][Animal Cell Components]"> <img alt="Animal Cell Components" class="lightbox" src="https://online.science.psu.edu/sites/default/files/biol110/Tutorial25_cell_cycle.jpg" style="float: left; height: 253px; width: 300px; margin: 10px;" title="Animal Cell Components" /> </a> events be set in motion that lead to cell division. As long as the signal is present, the two new daughter cells will continue to replicate themselves in a cyclical process known as the <strong>cell cycle</strong>.</p>
</div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The cell cycle is a continuous process, but to make it easier to study it can be broken down into four phases. The <strong>M phase</strong> is the mitotic phase. The other three phases are collectively known as <strong>interphase</strong>. The three phases of interphase following mitosis are: the the <strong>G1</strong> growth phase, the <strong>S phase</strong> or synthesis phase, which is when DNA is replicated, and the <strong>G2</strong> growth phase. Although the synthesis of nuclear DNA is restricted to the S phase, replication of cellular components can occur throughout the cell cycle (mostly being limited to G1, S, and G2).</p>
<h2>Introduction to Mitosis</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The dynamic process of mitosis takes many eukaryotic cells about 1-3 hours to complete. During this time, the cell completes a number of stages. Often the process is simplified and drawn as discrete steps, but it is important to remember that these steps represent landmarks in a continuous process.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To determine which stage of cell division is occurring during mitosis, one observes the behavior of the nucleus. The stages of mitosis are prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase. Each stage will be discussed next.</p>
<h2>Major Events of Mitosis: Prophase</h2>
<p><a class="highslide lightbox-processed" href="https://online.science.psu.edu/sites/default/files/biol110/Tutorial25_DNA_organization.jpg" rel="lightbox[][DNA Organization]"><img alt="DNA Organization" class="lightbox" src="https://online.science.psu.edu/sites/default/files/biol110/Tutorial25_DNA_organization.jpg" style="float: left; height: 200px; width: 350px; margin: 10px;" title="DNA Organization" /> </a>The first phase of mitosis, <strong>prophase</strong>, is marked by the condensation of chromosomes.&nbsp; During interphase, DNA is replicated and the replicated chromosomes remain relatively stretched out. It is difficult to visualize individual chromosomes prior to prophase using standard microscopy. This changes once the cell progresses into G2.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The chromosomes begin to condense at some point during G2. In this complex process, each replicated elongated chromosome becomes supercoiled and, as a result, becomes considerably shorter and more tightly packed (depicted in this figure). Each replicated chromosome is only a few microns long, and by the end of prophase appears as two replicated <strong>chromatids</strong> attached at the <strong>centromere</strong>. It is important to consider the significance of chromosome condensation; a highly compacted chromosome is easier to move than a stretched-out one. Moreover, chromosomes will physically be moved around in the cell later. If the DNA were stretched out, it would be subject to physical shearing. In the condensed form, it is less prone to physical damage.</p>
<h2>Major Events of Mitosis: Metaphase</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As the spindle fibers begin attaching to the condensed chromosomes, a complex interaction begins between the mitotic spindle and the chromosomes. The chromosomes begin to jostle back and forth; the microtubules push and pull each of the attached chromosomes. This scenario marks the transition into <strong>metaphase </strong><a class="highslide lightbox-processed" href="https://online.science.psu.edu/sites/default/files/biol110/Tutorial25_metaphase.jpg" rel="lightbox[][Metaphase]"><img alt="Metaphase" class="lightbox" src="https://online.science.psu.edu/sites/default/files/biol110/Tutorial25_metaphase.jpg" style="float: right; height: 238px; width: 300px; margin: 10px;" title="Metaphase" /></a>and represents an intricate cellular event whereby all of the chromosomes appear in a line (the <strong>metaphase plate</strong>) because the balance of forces drives the collection of all replicated and condensed chromosomes into a single plane in preparation for their segregation.</p>
<p>It is not understood how the cell "knows" when the chromosomes are precisely lined up. However, it is known that this is an important "checkpoint" and that the cell will not proceed to the next step until all of the chromosomes are properly positioned. The jostling of chromosomes can take a good deal of time. Therefore, this stage takes the longest time in most cells.</p>
<h4>Major Events of Mitosis: Anaphase</h4>
<p>Spindle fibers typically attach to replicated chromosomes at the centromere. Importantly, each chromatid has a centromere; therefore, in metaphase, the back-and-forth jostling results in chromosomes that are not only lined up in a single plane, but each sister chromatid is aligned opposite one another. This arrangement is well suited for accurate partitioning of the chromatid.</p>
<p>Once the cell senses proper alignment along the metaphase plate, the replicated chromatids separate rapidly, signifying <strong>anaphase</strong>. Three things happen during anaphase: first, the centromeres that hold the chromatids together dissolve, separating the pairs from each other; second, the newly freed chromatids (now properly called chromosomes) move rapidly toward the spindle poles; and third, the spindle poles move apart. Anaphase is a rapid process (in some cells it is completed within 5 minutes).</p>
<h2>Major Events of Mitosis: Telophase and Cytokinesis</h2>
<p>The replicated chromosomes (formally called chromatids) are at opposite ends of the spindle poles at the end of anaphase. Both halves of the cell contain equal numbers and kinds of chromosomes. At this point, the nuclear membranes of the daughter cells begin to reform around the new chromosomes located at either end of the cell. At the same time, the chromosomes begin to decondense. The decondensation of chromosomes and nuclear envelope reformation characterizes the <strong>telophase</strong> stage of mitosis. Note that these two new nuclei contain identical genetic material. For instance, in a human cell there are 46 chromosomes: 23 of paternal origin and 23 of maternal origin. Telophase marks the last part of karyokinesis (the division of genetic material).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At the same time that nuclear membranes are reforming during telophase, something remarkable is happening to the other cellular components. Remember, the other organelles have already replicated on their own. They are also being separated into the two ends of the cell. The cell then closes off the center of the parent cell, thereby forming two new daughter cells. This process of partitioning the parental cytoplasm (including organelles) is called <strong>cytokinesis</strong>.</p>
