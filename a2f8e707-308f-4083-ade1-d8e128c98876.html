<h2>Genetics Selection and Speciation Part 3 VoiceThread Transcript</h2><p>Slide 1<br>In this tutorial - we are talking about speciation. &nbsp;Speciation is the process of creating a new species. &nbsp;But before we can talk about speciation - we need to talk about the definition of a species.</p><p>There are many definitions of a species - we will talk about three examples: the morphological species concept, the evolutionary species concept, and the Biological species concept.</p><p><br>Slide 2<br>The morphological species concept states that a species is a group of individuals with shared morphologies or appearances.</p><p>This definition makes sense - it is probably no surprise to learn that the Blackburnian warbler is a distinct and separate species from the Chestnut-sided warbler. &nbsp;They look different from each other.</p><p>Slide 3<br>This definition does not always work, however, &nbsp;For a long time it was thought that these two parrots are from different species because they look so different from each other. &nbsp;In fact, they are the male and female of the same species - sexual dimorphism can make the morphological species concept difficult to use.</p><p>Also, look at these ants - they look very different from each other. &nbsp;But in fact they are sisters - ants are an example of what are known as eusocial insects and each ant in the colony has a very specific role or job. &nbsp;Even genetically very similar individuals can look quite different depending upon their job. &nbsp;Again, the morphological species concept is difficult to use with these ants.</p><p>Slide 4<br>The morphological species concept is also difficult to use when different species look very similar. &nbsp;This is the case with Eastern and Western Meadowlarks. &nbsp;It is challenging for even a seasoned ornithologist to tell these species apart by simply looking at them. &nbsp;They are, however, considered distinct species because they have very different songs and do not usually mate with each other.</p><p><br>Slide 5<br>The Evolutionary species concept groups organisms together based on shared evolutionary history. &nbsp;This can be a useful definition but it also has limitations - specifically because we usually do not know the full evolutionary history of a species.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Slide 6<br>The Biological Species Concept is the definition that is used the most by biologists. &nbsp;It describes a species as a group of potentially interbreeding individuals that can produce fertile offspring. &nbsp;The limitations of this definition is that it cannot be used to describe asexual and extinct species. &nbsp;Also, sometimes different species do interbreed and produce hybrids - often, however, these hybrids are not fertile.</p><p>An example of this is a mating between a horse and donkey to produce a mule. &nbsp;Horses and donkeys are considered distinct species because mules are sterile.</p><p>Slide 7<br>Regardless of the definition that is used to define a species - we know that the number of species has been steadily increasing since the evolution of life on earth. &nbsp;While there have been periods of mass extinction - such as at the end of the Cretaceous 65 million years ago. &nbsp;It is not the biggest extinction but it is the most famous because it ended the age of dinosaurs and made way for mammals and birds. &nbsp;During this event, 50% of the known genera (a genus is a level of organization just above a species) - went extinct.</p><p>Despite these mass extinctions, the number of different types of organisms has been increasing. &nbsp;Some biologists estimate that there may be 150 million different species on earth.</p><p>Slide 8&nbsp;<br>The definition that is used to define a species has more than just biological implications. &nbsp;It can have politcal implications as well. &nbsp;</p><p>For example, the Endangered Species Act is some of the strongest environmental legislation that exists in the United States. &nbsp;This legislation was enacted to save species from going extinct as a result of human activity. &nbsp;</p><p>The endangered species act uses the Biological Species Concept to define a species. &nbsp;This has implications for organisms like the Red Wolf - Canis rufus.</p><p>The Red Wolf used to range through out the southeastern US (and even into central Pennsylvania) but it became extinct in the wild in 1980. &nbsp;In 1987 it was reintroduced into North Carolina in efforts to reestablish a wild population. &nbsp;These efforts have been successful but controversial. &nbsp;Red wolves and gray wolves can interbreed and produce fertile offspring - so people have argued about the validity of giving the red wolf distinct species status. &nbsp;The Fish and Wildlife Service considers the matter settled and supports the idea that the red wolf is a separate species from the gray wolf and deserves protection under the endangered species act.</p>
