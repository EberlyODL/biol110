<h3 id="PopulationGeneticsandEvolution-IntroductionandLearningObjectives">Introduction and Learning Objectives</h3>
<p>So far, we have talked about the behavior of genes that are passed from one generation to the next, focusing on the genotypes and phenotypes of individuals. Now we'll take a broader look at genetics and see how the genetics of populations are studied. As you will learn, evolutionary change takes place through changes in the genetic composition of a population. The field of population genetics spans the disciplines of genetics and evolution. By the end of this tutorial you should have a working understanding of:</p>
<ul><li>The definition of a population</li><li>How genetic variation in a population is studied</li><li>The Hardy-Weinberg equation</li><li>The factors that influence changes in allele frequencies</li><li>How the founder effect and bottleneck effect relate to genetic drift</li><li>How gene flow, mutations, and mating behavior can affect genetic stability</li><li>How selection can influence allele frequency</li></ul>
<p>Performance Objectives</p>
<ul><li>Describe the assumptions of a population in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium</li><li>Apply the appropriate Hardy-Weinberg equations (allele and genotype frequencies) to solve population genetics problems</li><li>Explain how the factors that can cause a population to move away from HW equilibrium lead to evolution</li><li>Describe&nbsp;how both a population bottleneck and a founder event can lead to genetic drift, and its effect on allele frequencies</li><li>Describe how mutation can be a source of new alleles in a population, and why some mutations can be neutral, rather than harmful or beneficial</li><li>Illustrate how migration can affect the genetic structure of a population</li><li>Explain why non-random mating can change the genotype frequencies in a population, but not the allele frequencies</li></ul>
