<h2>Congratulations! This definitely sounds like a great achievement. We are Penn State!</h2>
<p>While this may (or may not) make you proud, let&#39;s take a closer look at this study. Did you get asked questions as part of this survey? &nbsp;Did your friends? &nbsp;Did your dorm neighbor?</p>
<p>I am guessing that your answer to most of these questions is NO.</p>
<p>There are an estimated 14 million students in U.S. universities, and, while the survey sample size of 122,000 university students may seem like a lot, does this result represent the populous view of U.S. university students?</p>
<p>How practical/easy do you think it would be to question all 14 million U.S. university students? It would be a difficult task. So how do you test hypotheses if you cannot use the entire population?</p>
<p>This has already been alluded to in your simple experimental design where you used a subset of people to test your hypotheses about fast food and obesity&mdash;i.e. you sub-sampled. In effect, you are making inferences about the entire population based on the smaller sample.</p>

<p><img alt="Population Sample" src="https://online.science.psu.edu/sites/default/files/biol110/population_sample.png" style="width: 400px; height: 276px;" title="Population Sample" /></p>
<p><strong>Population:</strong> The group of individuals, or items, to be studied is called the population (N).</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">E.g. The U.S. university student population in the "Party School" example.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">E.g. The adult U.S. population in the "Fast Food and Obesity" example.</p>
<p><strong>Sample:</strong> A subset (n) of the entire population (N). &nbsp;Those people, objects, or events selected from the population for inclusion in the study.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">E.g. The 122,000 students surveyed in the "Party School" example.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">E.g. The 50 control group and 50 treatment group individuals in the "Fast Food and Obesity" example.</p>
<h6>Note that the notation for the entire population is an uppercase N, whereas for the sample it is a lowercase n.</h6>
