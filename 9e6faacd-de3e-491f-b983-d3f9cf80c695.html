<h2>Hereditary and Life Cycles Part 1 VoiceThread Transcript</h2>
<p>Slide 1<br>We started this course by briefly discussing evolution and natural selection.&nbsp; We are now going to revisit these ideas as a way to begin discussing genetics.&nbsp; Remember the definitions of these terms.&nbsp; The term "evolution" is used to refer to genetic changes that take place in populations of organisms over time.&nbsp; The term "natural selection" is used to refer to the differential reproduction that can occur in populations.&nbsp; In other words, within a population some individuals are more likely to survive, reproduce, and pass on their genes than other individuals.&nbsp; The individuals that are most likely to survive and reproduce are those individuals with the most beneficial traits.&nbsp; In a drought year in the Galapagos islands, the seeds have a tough seed coat, and those finches with bigger, stronger beaks are more likely to survive and reproduce.&nbsp; The environment is naturally selecting for individuals with larger size beaks and results in the evolution of a population with larger average beak size.</p>
<p>Natural selection is not the only means by which a population can evolve - we will be discussing other mechanisms of evolution later in the course.&nbsp; But natural selection has one very important caveat - it results in populations that are better adapted to their environment than previous generations.&nbsp; This is unique to natural selection and the other mechanisms of evolution do not have this feature.</p>
<p>Slide 2<br>Charles Darwin - the so-called "father of evolution" proposed that in order for natural selection to take place there must be variation in populations - in other words, organisms must be different from each other.&nbsp; He also realized that this variation must be heritable - the variable traits must be passed from parents to offspring.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, even though Darwin did not know about genes or chromosomes or how heredity works, he did realize that there must be an understandable way for parents to pass traits to their offspring. He essentially predicted the field of genetics.</p>
<p>In order to understand genetics and evolution, we must understand how genetic variation is generated and maintained in populations.</p>
<p>Slide 3<br>We now understand that natural selection cannot occur without variation.&nbsp; Think back to the example of the seed-eating finches on the Galapagos.&nbsp; During times of drought seed coats become thick and hard to crack.&nbsp; Therefore, the individuals with larger beaks were more likely to survive and reproduce than individuals with smaller beaks.&nbsp; In this environment, natural selection acts on the variation existing in the population and selects the individuals with larger beaks.</p>
<p>But where does this variation come from?&nbsp; There are two sources of genetic variation in populations - mutation and sexual reproduction.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mutation is a term that refers to mistakes during the replication of DNA (remember - before a cell divides the chromosomes have to make a copy of themselves - that is DNA replication and mistakes can sometimes occur during this process).&nbsp; This is a relatively rare mechanism for generating variation and we will talk about this more later in the course.</p>
<p>Sexual reproduction is the mechanism that is most responsible for generating variation within populations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Slide 4<br>So, what is sex?&nbsp; You probably have an idea of what sex is but you may be surprised at how boring the defintion truly is!&nbsp; Sex refers to the exchange and/or recombination of genetic material.&nbsp; In other words, DNA must be exchanged and recombined.&nbsp;<br>This process does not have to be coupled with reproduction - for example, conjugation is an exchange of DNA between bacteria but there is no reproduction - no new individuals are produced.</p>
<p>But sex always produces genetically distinct individuals and the genetic variation results in individuals that are different from<br>each other.</p>
<p>Slide 5<br>Here is an example of sex without reproduction.&nbsp; One bacterium, the one I am circling, is passing DNA to another.&nbsp; Sex has taken place because this individual has new DNA, but there has not been any reproduction.&nbsp; Two individuals started the process of conjugation and two individuals are present at the end - no new individuals have been produced.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Slide 6<br>On the other hand, many organisms reproduce without sex.&nbsp; This is known as asexual reproduction and it is a cloning process.&nbsp; It results in offspring that are genetically identical to the parent.&nbsp; Examples of organisms that reproduce asexually are paramecium which produce offspring through a process known as fission or hydra which produce offspring through budding.&nbsp; In both cases, the offspring are genetically identical to the parent individual.</p>
<p>Slide 7<br>Asexual reproduction is a cloning process - a clone is genetically identical to the original individual.&nbsp; We tend to discuss cloning as something that is done in a scientific laboratory but cloning has been happening in nature for billions of years and you may have cloned an organism.&nbsp; If you have ever taken a spider baby off a parent spider plant and rooted it to form a new plant - you have cloned an organism.</p>
<p>Slide 8<br>To&nbsp; understand the inheritance of traits, we need to understand chromosomes - the structures on which genes are located.&nbsp; We will be looking at mainly diploid organisms in this course - diploid organisms have two copies of each chromosome.&nbsp; These pairs of chromosomes are called homologous chromosomes.&nbsp; Homologous chromosomes have the same size, shape and sequence of genes - as seen in this image of a homologous pair of chromosome from a pea plant.&nbsp; In a diploid organism, one member of the pair is inherited from the mother and one from the father.&nbsp; While homologous chromsomes have the same genes, they can have different alleles.&nbsp; Alleles are variants of genes.&nbsp; In this diagram, the gene is the gene for flower color in pea plants and the alleles are purple versus white.&nbsp; It is the different alleles that are responsible for the genetic variation in populations.&nbsp; In pea plants, some individuals have purpler flowers and some have white.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Slide 9<br>To understand how parents pass traits to offspring - let's look at this diagram of sexual reproduction in a typical animal - humans.&nbsp; This concept should be familiar to you but let's look at the details. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In humans, women produce eggs (which are haploid) and men produce sperm (which are also haploid).&nbsp; During sex a sperm fertilizes an egg to produce a zygote (which is diploid).&nbsp; The zygote divides via mitosis to produce a multicellular individual which eventually matures into an adult.&nbsp; The type of cell division that produces the sperm and egg is meiosis. Meiosis is similar to mitosis but it has some important differences.</p>
<p>Slide 10<br>Remember that mitosis is a cloning process - when a cell goes through mitosis it produces two daughter cells that are genetically identical to the original parent cell.&nbsp; Meiosis, on the other hand, is a reductional division - it produces daughter cells that have half the ploidy-level (or number of chromsomes) as the original parent cell.&nbsp; So in the sexual life cycle of a human, the parent cells are diploid but meiosis produces haploid gametes (sperm and eggs).&nbsp; Fertilization then restores the diploid number.&nbsp; A sexual life cycle involves an alternation between haploid gametes and diploid cells.</p>
