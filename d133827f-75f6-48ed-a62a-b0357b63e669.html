<h2>Subcellular Architecture Part 3 VoiceThread Transcript</h2>
<p>Slide 1<br>The endosymbiotic theory states that mitochondria and chloroplasts are derived from endosymbiotic bacteria that were engulfed by a larger cell.</p>
<p>Mitochondria most likely arose from Rickettsiales (bacteria that are mainly known to live as endosymbionts - modern day representatives of these bacteria cause typhus and Rocky Mountain spotted fever)</p>
<p>Chloroplasts from cyanobacteria (photosynthetic bacteria)</p>
<p>Slide 2<br>The evidence for endosymbiosis includes:</p>
<p>That mitochondria and chloroplasts have a circular DNA "chromosome" that is the same size as a typical bacterial genome.</p>
<p>They also have two membranes - an and outer that resulted from being engulfed by a larger cell.</p>
<p>Mitochondria and chloroplasts divide by binary fission just like bacteria do.</p>
<p>In eukaryotic cells, nuclear DNA contains genes that probably came from proto-mitochondria and proto-plastids</p>
<p>Some proteins that are encoded in the nucleus are transported to mitochondria and chloroplasts</p>
<p>and the Ribosomes of mitochondria and chloroplasts are bacteria-like - unlike the ribosomes found in the rest of the eukaryotic cell.</p>
<p>Slide 3<br>Biologists have been able to observe endosymbiosis in the lab.&nbsp; Discovered in 2006, Hatena arenicola is an organism believed to be in the process of an endosybiosis.&nbsp; It is a eukaryote that behaves like a heterotrophic predator - until it ingests a certain species of green algae and then it becomes an autotroph.</p>
<p>Slide 4<br>Endosymbionts occur all throughout the world.&nbsp; The guts of termites are whacky places full of all kinds of strange organisms - both prokaryotes and eukaryotes.</p>
<p>Trichonympha - for example - helps termites to digest cellulose.&nbsp; However, they require bacterial endosymbionts to produce the enzyme that digest celluose.&nbsp; Without the bacterial endosymbiont they cannot digest cellulose.&nbsp; They also have bacterial endosymbionts that function as flagella and help the organism move through its environment. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Mixotricha is equally as strange.&nbsp; It also has bacterial endosymbionts that help it digest cellulose and function as flagella in motility.</p>
<p>It has additional bacterial endosymbionts that function as mitochondria - because mixotricha do not have their own mitochondria.</p>
<p>Our current secretary of energy Steven Chu is a nobel-prize winning physicist who believes the termite gut may provide insight into alternative energy sources.&nbsp; When these organisms digest celluose they produce ethanol - ethanol that can be used as a biofuel.</p>
<p>Slide 5</p>
<p>The evolution of eukaryotic cells via endosymbiosis implies that there was a selective advantage to this relationship.&nbsp; As an example, we will look at the evolution of the relationship that resulted in mitochondria.</p>
<p>To understand the evolution of this relationship we need to remember that conditions on early earth were very different than they are now.</p>
<p>About 3.5 billion years ago cyanobacteria were polluting the atmosphere with oxygen - oxygen is a by-product of the photosynthesis that was being performed by the cyanobacteria.</p>
<p>By 2 BYA the atmosphere was becoming aerobic-how could obligate anaerobes survive this toxic environment?&nbsp; Remember, many organisms are poisoned by oxygen so in an increasingly aerobic environment these organisms needed to find a way to protect themselves.</p>
<p>The answer was to get rid of oxygen by converting the oxygen to water - remember, this is what happens at the end of the electron transport chain in the mitochondria - oxygen is reduced to water.</p>
<p>Primitive eukaryotes formed symbioses with prokaryotes to protect themselves from the effects of oxygen.&nbsp; This increased the fitness of the primitive eukaryote due to the detoxification of oxygen.</p>
<p>So the ancestral function of the mitochondrion was to detoxify oxygen in the environment.&nbsp; Today the<br>more derived function of the mitochondrion is energy transduction - converting the energy of the electrons found in the NADH and FADH2 produced by glycolysis and the krebs cycle to energy in the form of ATP.</p>
