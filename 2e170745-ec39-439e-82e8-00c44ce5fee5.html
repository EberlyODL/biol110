<h2>Genetics Selection and Speciation Part 6 VoiceThread Transcript</h2><p>Slide 1<br>The Prezygotic and postzygotic isolating mechanisms described earlier, explain how closely related species stay separate. &nbsp;But how did they become distinct species in the first place?</p><p>There are two basic ways for speciation to occur - allopatric and sympatric speciation.</p><p>Slide 2<br>The prefix allo means other while the prefix sym means same. &nbsp;The suffix patric means homeland.</p><p><br>Slide 3<br>Allopatric speciation requires a physical or geographical barrier between populations</p><p>Sympatric speciation requires genetic isolation even when populations ranges overlap</p><p><br>Slide 4<br>This image illustrates the difference between these two processes.</p><p>Allopatric speciation, on the left, requires a physical barrier to form between the two populations and speciation ultimately results.</p><p>Sympatric speciation, on the right, occurs when populations diverge due to some biological barrier between them - not a physical barrier. &nbsp;The two populations inhabit the same area.</p><p>Slide 5<br>An example of allopatric speciation is the divergence of two populations of antelope squirrels into separate species.</p><p>The Grand Canyon is a barrier to dispersal by small mammals, and as a consequence the isolated populations can diverge and become distinct species.</p><p><br>Slide 6<br>Allopatric speciation is frequently seen on islands. &nbsp;This image shows the speciation of a mainland population of kingfishers into several different island species of kingfishers. &nbsp;Individuals from the mainland dispersed to the islands where they were geographically and thus genetically isolated from each other. &nbsp;Over time genetic differences accumulated to the point where they are all different species.</p><p><br>Slide 7<br>This type of island colonization and subsequent speciation is referred to as adaptive radiation. &nbsp;</p><p>In adaptive radiation a single species colonizes an island and adapts to that island and becomes a distinct species. &nbsp;The individuals from the new species subsequently disperse to another island in the group and then adapts to that new environment and another new species evolves.</p><p>There are several classic examples of adaptive radiation including Darwin√≠s Finches on the Galapagos islands and Hawaiian Silverswords on the Hawaiian islands.</p><p><br>Slide 8<br>Sympatric speciation can be more difficult to conceptualize because populations are not physically separated from each other but some factor creates genetic isolation.</p><p>This is commonly observed in plants. &nbsp;Some plants can self-fertilize and, if there was an error during mitosis or meiosis, they may produce polyploid offspring. &nbsp;Polyploids have more than the diploid number of chromosomes. &nbsp;Because the offspring have a different number of chromosomes from the parents - they are genetically isolated and a speciation event can occur.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p>
