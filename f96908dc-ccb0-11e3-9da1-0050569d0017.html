<p>You are becoming familiar with the scientific process, and in particular, hypothesis generation and testing. You have also looked at basic examples of hypothesis testing and experimental design.</p>

<p>However, the world is a little more complex than what has been talked about so far, and many different studies are conducted that may be of interest to you. &nbsp;So let&#39;s continue our discovery by looking more closely at data.</p>
<ul>
	<li>How is it gathered?</li>
	<li>How is it treated once gathered?</li>
	<li>How is it used to test hypotheses?&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Learning the process of science cannot be done overnight. Rather, just like a plumber or a carpenter has a toolbox full of the tools needed for their trade to get the job done. &nbsp;Now that you are familiar with the scientific method, over the next few weeks you will start to compile your scientific toolbox that will arm you with all the tools you need to critically test hypotheses. The first step is to understand the differences between a population and a sample, as well as calculating averages and measures of variability.</p>
