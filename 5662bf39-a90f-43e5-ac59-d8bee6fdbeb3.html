<p>The diversity of plants existing today is the result of 475-700 million years of evolution and adaptation to the terrestrial environment. Plants arose from a lineage of green algae and their closest protest relatives are the Charophytes. Both have cellulosic cell walls, form cell plates during cytokinesis, store carbon in the form of starch, have chlorophyll b as an accessory pigment, and share similar RNA and DNA sequences for particular genes. Charophytes are aquatic organisms, and it is highly likely that the earliest plants occupied transitional environments between the sea and the land. The transition to the terrestrial environment was advantageous for plants because there was direct access to sunlight and little to no herbivore activity. Early plants were ill-equipped for life out of the water, and desiccation was a major challenge to a land-based existence.</p>
<p>Adaptations to the terrestrial environment enabled generation after generation of plants to successfully live out of the water. The waxy cuticle and stomata are effective in reducing water loss and preventing desiccation. Vascular tissue further reduces the problem of desiccation because it allows transport of water and nutrients throughout the plant. Upright growth for improved access to sunlight is also an advantage conferred by vascular tissue because it also functions in internal support of the plant body. Protection of gametes and developing embryos is the role of jacketed gametangia, and later, the seed. More recently in plant history, adaptive features have been influenced by other organisms in the terrestrial environment; some plants produce specialized flower structures and fruits that attract insects and other animals that aid in pollination and seed dispersal.</p>
<p>The nonvascular plants (including mosses, liverworts and hornworts) are highly successful and can be found the world over. They are resistant to desiccation, but prefer a moist environment due to their lack of vascular tissue and motile gametes. Nonvascular plants, like other plants, are embryophytes, and their life cycles are based on alternation of generations. The prominent generation of nonvascular plants is the multicellular haploid gametophyte. The diploid sporophyte generation is completely dependent on the gametophyte for its survival. In the more derived plant lineages, the gametophyte is greatly reduced. You should also know that the nonvascular plants do not have vascular tissue or seeds, however, they do have a stomata, a protected embryo, and most have a waxy cuticle. Seedless vascular plants are more derived than nonvascular plants and are defined by their lack of seed production and presence of vascular tissue. The more derived lineages, nonflowering seed plants and flowering seed plants, both produce seeds, but only the flowering seed plants produce flowers and fruits. Life cycles and the major characteristics of the&nbsp;vascular plants will be covered in the next two&nbsp;tutorials.</p>
