<p>Previously, we considered the expression pattern of genes that are found on different chromosomes (therefore, they independently assort). However, what is the behavior of genes that are located a particular chromosome? What happens to traits that are found on the sex chromosomes?</p><p>In many sexually reproducing organisms, sex is determined by genes that are located on dissimilar chromosomes. These dissimilar chromosomes are termed sex chromosomes. Humans possess 23 pairs of chromosomes; 22 of these are similar (autosomes), whereas one pair (the X and Y chromosomes) is dissimilar and possesses the genes responsible for the transmission of character traits that determine sex. If an individual has the XX genotype, the individual is female, while the XY genotype results in males. There are two important facts to remember about sex chromosomes. First, the X chromosome is generally larger and has more genes than the Y chromosome. Second, genes that affect traits other than sex are also found on these chromosomes (for example, a gene that affects tooth enamel in humans is found on both the X and the Y).</p><p>With the above two facts in mind, consider the male genotype (XY). Because the X chromosome has more genes than the Y, not all alleles will be found in the heterozygous state. That is, the maternally derived alleles may be expressed as if they were in the homozygous state. (Remember that the male's X chromosome comes from the mother.) Traits that are disproportionately expressed in one gender (typically males) are termed sex-linked traits. That is, sex-linked traits tend to follow (are linked to) the gender from which they're derived.</p><p>In the following tutorial, we will examine the relationship of genes that are located on the same autosome.</p>
