<h2>Mitosis VoiceThread Transcript</h2>
<p>Slide 1<br>To understand the evolution of life on earth - we must gain an understanding of genetics.&nbsp; To understand genetics, we must understand cell division.</p>
<p>There are two types of cell division in eukaryotic organisms - mitosis and meiosis.&nbsp; We will start by discussing mitosis.&nbsp; Mitosis is cell division that is essentially a cloning process - during mitosis a cell divides and produces two cells that are genetically identical.&nbsp; Mitosis gives rise to two daughter cells that have the same ploidy number as the original parent cell.&nbsp; Ploidy number refers to the number of copies of each type of chromosome - haploid organisms have one copy of each chromosome, diploid organisms have two copies of each chromosome, and triploid organisms have three copies.&nbsp; Most of the organisms that we will be discussing during this course are diploid and have two copies of each chromosome.&nbsp; A diploid cell that goes through mitosis creates two daughter cells that are also diploid.</p>
<p>In single-celled organisms, mitosis is used for reproduction.&nbsp; However, we will mainly be looking at multi-cellular organisms and multicellular organisms use mitois for growth and repair of damaged tissues.</p>
<p>Slide 2<br>The division of a cell is an aspect of a cell's cycle.&nbsp; In general, the cell cycle is comprised of two main stages - interphase and M-phase.&nbsp; Interphase is the stage in which all of the cell activities other than division take place.&nbsp; The M-phase refers to either mitosis or meiosis and is the stage during which the cell divides.</p>
<p>Slide 3<br>For this course, you do not need to know details about mitosis other than the movement of the chromosomes</p>
<p>Chromosome movement during cell division is key to understanding genetics - our next topic</p>
<p>Slide 4<br>Mitosis is a continous process but we can divide the process into stages by looking at key landmarks during cell division. These landmarks are so obvious, they can be seen by using a simple light microscope and a cell stain, as seen in the microscope images at the top of this image.</p>
<p>Slide 5<br>Interphase is the longest stage in the cell cycle and it is the time when a cell makes the decision to divide.&nbsp; Once the decision to divide has been made, the cell prepares for division.&nbsp; During S-phase of interphase, the chromsomes are replicated.&nbsp; S stands for synthesis and refers to the process of DNA replication which we will learn more about later in the course.</p>
<p>Prior to chromosome replication, the chromosome is comprised of a single strand.&nbsp; After the chromosome is replicated, the chromosome is comprised of two strands known as sister chromatids.&nbsp; The sister chromatids are identical to each other and they are attached at a location known as a centromere.&nbsp; A replicated chromosome is still considered a single chromsome - but it is a chromosome comprised of two identical sister chromatids.</p>
<p>Slide 6<br>Remember, as we discuss mitosis we are only focusing on the movement and behavior of the chromosomes.&nbsp; You may have learned mitosis in a previous class and focused on other aspects of cell division such as the behavior of the nuclear envelope or formation of the mitotic spindle.&nbsp; We will not discuss these features during the course.&nbsp; So the one thing you need to know about prophase is that the chromosomes condense into distinct structures (during interphase the chromosomes are diffuse and cannot be observed as distinct structures - they need to condense for cell division to avoid damaging the chromosome).</p>
<p>Slide 7<br>During metaphase, the chromosomes line up along the equator of the cell - a region known as the metaphase plate.&nbsp; This is essentially an organizational stage - cell division is a well-orchestrated process and requires careful movement of the chromsomes. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Slide 8<br>During anaphase, the centromere regions of each replicated chromosome splits and each chromatid becomes a distinct chromosome.&nbsp; Remember, the sister chromatids are genetically identical to each other - so two genetically identical sets of chromosomes are separating from each other during this phase.&nbsp; The now-distinct chromosomes move to opposite pole regions of the cell.</p>
<p>Slide 9<br>During telophase, the last stage of mitosis, the cell prepares to become two new genetically identical cells.&nbsp; A nucleus forms at each pole of the cell.&nbsp; Remember, the chromosomes at each pole used to be sister chromatids and are genetically identical.</p>
<p>Slide 10<br>The process of mitosis is completed when cytokinesis takes place.&nbsp; Cytokinesis is the division of the cytoplasm to produce two new distinct cells.&nbsp; Prior to mitosis all of the cell organelles were also being replicted so each new cell has a complete set of organelles and is a complete cell.&nbsp; Mitosis is now complete and our original parent cell has given rise to two new genetically identical daughter cells.<br>&nbsp;</p>
