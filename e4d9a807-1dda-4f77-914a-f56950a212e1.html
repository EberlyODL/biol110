<p>Within a typical population, many characters show variation in the form of alternative traits. Some character traits vary continuously, from one extreme to another (e.g., height in a human population), and are referred to as quantitative characters. Other traits vary discretely (e.g., eye color).</p>
<p>Some of these character traits may provide the individuals that have them with an advantage not &nbsp;held by others in the population. If these individuals show greater differential reproductive success (i.e. they are more fit), then the allele(s) encoding the trait will increase in frequency and natural selection will have taken place.</p>
<p><strong>Fitness</strong>&nbsp;is a term that has a precise biological meaning - reproductive success. Fitness is typically referenced relatively. In simplest terms, an individual who produces four offspring is relatively more fit than one who produces three offspring (providing all offspring themselves survive to reproduce and are more fit themselves). The individual producing four fit offspring contributes 25% more of their genes to the next generation than the individual producing three fit offspring.</p>
<p>By this definition of fitness, individuals can die young and be fit, providing they produce more offspring than other members of their population. Conversely, individuals can be long-lived and unfit if they produce fewer offspring.</p>

<h2 id="Genetics,SelectionandSpeciation-TheSalmonExample">The Salmon Example</h2>
<p>An organism's success has little to do with its longevity, but rather, its ability to successfully reproduce. Many successful plants (e.g., annual wildflowers) grow for a season, reproduce, and then die. Many successful insects live for only twenty-four hours but still manage to reproduce and make their contribution to the gene pool.</p>
<p>In some cases, individuals contribute more to the next generation than simply their genes.</p>

<p>Salmon inhabit Pacific waters and spend most of their lives in seawater, but migrate to freshwater streams to breed. The salmon that live in the Pacific Ocean and reproduce in headwater streams (small streams found at higher altitudes where few nutrients exist) have life cycles of approximately 4-5 years. The salmon that survive this perilous journey (approximately 1 in 100) reproduce and then die in the streams where they were born. &nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a great adaptation for the next generation. By dying immediately after reproduction, adult salmon indirectly provide for their young.</p>
<p></p>
<p>How does this work? Most Pacific coast headwater streams lack abundant nutrients. The nutrients released from the dead adult salmon enrich the stream and feed algal blooms and invertebrates. In turn, these organisms are a key food source for the hatchling offspring.</p>
