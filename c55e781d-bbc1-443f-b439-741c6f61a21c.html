<p>A&nbsp;<strong>test cross</strong>&nbsp;is used to determine the genotype of an individual with a dominant trait. Because the trait is dominant, an individual &nbsp;with &nbsp;the trait could be homozygous or heterozygous for the trait. (This cannot always be determined by simply looking at the phenotype of the individual.) In a test cross, an individual with the dominant phenotype is crossed with a fully recessive individual. As shown in this figure, there are two possible outcomes (depending on the genotype of the parent). By examining the offspring of the cross, the unknown genotype of the dominant parent can be determined.&nbsp;</p>
