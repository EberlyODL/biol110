<p>Slide 1<br>This first question asks you to think about how an X-linked recessive trait is passed through generations.</p>
<p>Slide 2<br>The answer is B - the man's maternal grandfather.</p>
<p>Slide 3<br>To understand this answer - it is best to write out what you know about the genotype of the man and his parents.&nbsp; He has red-green colorblindness and we know his parents have normal vision - therefore his mother must be a carrier.</p>
<p>Slide 4<br>That means we can disregard the man's father's side of the family - the allele for colorblindness was passed to him from his mother.</p>
<p>The question asks which grandparent is most likely to have red-green colorblindness?&nbsp; We know that this condition is more common in males than females so the maternal grandfather is most likely to have the condition.</p>
<p>Slide 5<br>This question test your understanding of the role that the X and Y chromosome play in sex determination.</p>
<p>Slide 6<br>The answer is A - male.&nbsp; Any individual that inherits a functional Y chromosome will develop into a male.&nbsp; It is possible for someone with a Y chromosome to develop into a phenotypic female - if there is a problem with the Y chromosomes or key genes found on the chromosome.</p>
<p>Slide 7<br>Hopefully this was an easy question! &nbsp;</p>
<p>Slide 8<br>The answer is C - no!&nbsp; Remember, males only have one copy of the X chromosome so they cannot be carriers.&nbsp; They can only be hemizygous for X-linked traits (except in the rare case when a male has two X chromosomes).</p>
<p>Slide 9<br>This question is best answered by creating a Punnett square involving the two parents.</p>
<p>Slide 10<br>The answer is D - half her sons will have normal vision and half her sons will be colorblind.</p>
<p>Slide 11<br>A Punnett square let's us visualize why option D was the untrue statement.&nbsp; The female is red-green colorblind while the male is normal.&nbsp; A Punnett square shows that all the sons will be colorblind.&nbsp; So D was the untrue statement.</p>
