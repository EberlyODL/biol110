<p>[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=2861|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__left__lightboxed]Johann Gregor Mendel&nbsp;was born in 1822 and was raised on his parents small farm, in what is now the Czech Republic. After attending high school and the&nbsp;Olm√ºtz&nbsp;Philosophical Institute, Mendel became a friar at an Augustinian monastery in Brno in 1843 at the age of 21. After several years of theological study, Mendel failed his teacher's examination and was sent to the University of Vienna (Austria) for two years of study from 1851-1853.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He returned to the monastery and began his studies of inheritance with pea plants (<em>Pisum</em>) grown in the monastery's garden. He published his work in 1865; however, it went largely unnoticed until its rediscovery in 1900, sixteen years after his death. Mendel's experiments demonstrated many of the basic principles of genetics, and his studies are used to illustrate the fundamental principles of inheritance.</p>
<h2 id="MendelandModernGenetics-CharactersandTraits">Characters and Traits</h2>
<p>Mendel probably chose to work with pea plants because of the many variants that exist in their&nbsp;<strong>morphology</strong>&nbsp;(physical appearance). The color of the flowers, seeds, and pods can differ between individuals, as can the position of the flower on the stem, the length of the stem, and the shape of the seeds and pods.&nbsp;<em>Pisum</em>&nbsp;provided Mendel with a wide variety of characteristics with which to examine patterns of inheritance. At this point, we need to introduce the terms that Mendel referred to as a&nbsp;<strong>character</strong>&nbsp;and a&nbsp;<strong>trait</strong>.</p>
<p>Mendel defined a character as a heritable feature for which variants exist, and a trait as a particular variant for the character. For example, flower color is a character, whereas purple and white are traits. Other characters (and traits) that he studied included: seed color (yellow or green); seed shape (round or wrinkled); pod shape (inflated or restricted); flower position (terminal or axial); and plant height (tall or dwarf).&nbsp;</p>

<p>In addition to&nbsp;<em>Pisum's</em>&nbsp;variety of characters and traits with which to study patterns of inheritance, Mendel also probably chose to study peas because their reproduction can be easily manipulated, which gave him strict control over the mating of different individuals. Peas will often&nbsp;<strong>self-fertilize</strong>&nbsp;(also termed "selfing"), transferring pollen from the stamens to the carpel on the same flower.</p>
<p>The ease by which peas can be "selfed" played an important role in Mendel's studies. In some cases, Mendel wanted to cross plants with different traits. This required that he prevent selfing by removing the immature stamens before they produced pollen; he then brushed the carpel with pollen from another individual. This enabled him to control the fertilization process, and therefore the parentage of each individual. The pollinated carpel matured into a pod, and the seeds within the pod were planted to give rise to a new generation of adult plants. The mature plants (produced by the seeds) were then scored for these traits, and the process repeated again as desired. This manipulation made it possible for Mendel to keep track of the parents of each individual, and to examine how traits were transmitted through generations</p>

<p>Mendel tracked heritable characters for three generations. In the first generation, the&nbsp;<strong>P generation</strong>&nbsp;(parental generation), Mendel crossed two "<strong>true-breeding</strong>" parents with differing traits for one or more characters. "True-breeding" means that all of the offspring &nbsp;have the same trait as the parent when the offspring are produced by self-pollination. In this&nbsp;image, the individual with white flowers was true-breeding because all of the offspring produced from a self-pollination had white flowers. Similarly, the individual with purple flowers only produced offspring with purple flowers when self-pollinated.</p>
<p>The crossing of two true-breeding parents produced an&nbsp;<strong>F</strong><strong><sub>1</sub></strong>&nbsp;<strong>generation</strong>&nbsp;of hybrid individuals that exhibited only the trait found in one of the two parents. The trait that was expressed in the F<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;generation was termed a&nbsp;<strong>dominant trait</strong>. The F<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;generation hybrids were then each self-pollinated, producing an&nbsp;<strong>F</strong><strong><sub>2</sub></strong>&nbsp;<strong>generation</strong>. Although not present in the F<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;generation, the trait exhibited by the one parent reappeared in this generation, at approximately a 3:1 ratio of one parental trait to the other. The trait that reappeared in the F<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;generation was termed a&nbsp;<strong>recessive trait</strong>&nbsp;because it receded in the previous generation. Mendel counted large numbers (hundreds to thousands) of offspring in the F<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;generation, allowing him to analyze his results mathematically; using these data he determined the mode and manner of inheritance in this species.</p>
