<p>All of the cases that we have examined have had a single gene with two alleles. But what about genes that have three or more alleles? This is dealt with in the same way, but the determination of allele frequencies becomes a bit more involved.</p>
<p></p>
<p>You previously learned about the human ABO blood group system. This was used as an example of a gene with multiple alleles (I<sup>A</sup>, I<sup>B</sup>,&nbsp;<em>i</em>) and codominance because both alleles are expressed in AB heterozygous individuals. The O allele (designated as&nbsp;<em>i</em>) is recessive to the I<sup>A</sup>&nbsp;and I<sup>B</sup>&nbsp;alleles. Now weâ€™ll work a problem for a system with three alleles. In &nbsp;a human population, the I<sup>A</sup>&nbsp;allele has a frequency of 0.3 and the I<sup>B</sup>&nbsp;allele has a frequency of 0.1. Pull out a piece of paper and a pencil and write down these numbers.</p>
<p>First, calculate the frequency of the O allele. Remember, the allele frequencies for a particular gene must add up to one.&nbsp; Now that you have these three allele frequencies, determine the frequencies for all of the possible genotypes in the population.&nbsp; When you are finished, these should also add up to one.&nbsp; If it is helpful, the H-W equation that you would use for three alleles is p+q+r=1, and the equation for the genotypes is p<sup>2&nbsp;</sup>+ 2pq + q<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;+2pr +2qr&nbsp; + r<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;= 1.&nbsp;</p><object classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" height="480" id="myFlashContent" width="640"><object data="https://voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2107360" height="480" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="640"></object></object>

<h2 id="PopulationGeneticsandEvolution-UsingtheHardy-WeinbergEquationinEvolutionaryStudies">Using the Hardy-Weinberg Equation in Evolutionary Studies</h2>
<p>You should now appreciate how the Hardy-Weinberg equation can be used to study the genetic composition of a population. But how does this fit into evolution studies?</p>
<p>The answer is that changes in allele frequencies are the most fundamental indication that evolution is occurring in a population. If two populations of the same species have the same allele frequency for a given gene, it can be concluded &nbsp;that evolutionary forces are not operating on that gene (at least at that time). On the other hand, if the allele frequencies are different for a given gene, then evolutionary forces may be operating on that population.</p>
<p>If allele frequencies remain stable between generations, then the population is considered to be in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.</p>
