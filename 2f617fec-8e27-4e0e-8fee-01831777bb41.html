<p>This tutorial continued our discussion of the bilateria branch of the kingdom Animalia. When you think about this character (bilateral symmetry), keep in mind that it is observed in animals that actively move through their environment. Bilaterally symmetrical animals not only have a single plane of symmetry, but their sensory and cephalic areas are usually displaced toward the anterior end of the animal. There are two lineages of pseudocoelomates. The nematodes include free-living species as well as many species that are parasites of mammals, while the mostly free-living rotifers are an important part of the zooplankton.&nbsp; The mollucs are very diverse morphologically, ranging from the shell-less slugs to the bivalves with two large shells that are joined at a hinge. &nbsp;Some cephalopods show remarkable levels of intelligence for an invertebrate.&nbsp; The annelids show true segmentation, although their segments do not show extensive specialization.</p><p>Arthropods fall into one of five subphyla. Segmentation, and subsequent specialization, is one of the hallmarks of each of these five groups. Trilobites were a very successful group that became extinct about 250 million years ago. Although these animals were segmented, they had very little diversification in their segments.</p><p>The chelicerates include spiders. These animals have two major body segments: the cephalothorax and the abdomen. Their appendages are all clustered in the cephalothorax. Typically there are six pairs of appendages. These include the chelicerae, which are involved in feeding, and the pedipalps, which may have a feeding function. The remaining appendages are walking legs. The members of this group do not have antennae but do have simple eyes.</p><p>Crustaceans, the second largest extant subgroup, include mostly aquatic species, however, there are some terrestrial species. They have two pairs of sensory antennae, jaw-like mandibles, and compound eyes.</p><p>The millipedes and centipedes are myriapods. They have many unspecialized segments, and many pairs of legs. The usually have one pair of antennae and simple eyes.</p><p>The hexapods are the largest extant subgroup. They have jaw-like mandibles, compound eyes, one pair of sensory antennae, and unbranched (uniramous) appendages. This subgroup includes Class Insecta, which have distinct segments that may be highly specialized. Flight evolved in this group, and is in part responsible for its success and diversity.</p>
