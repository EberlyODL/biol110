<h2>Plants I Part 1 VoiceThread Transcript</h2><p>Slide 1<br>As we move through our survey of biodiversity, we are now going to begin talking about the plants.</p><p>There are four main categories of plants - however these groups are probably not monophyletic and just as we saw with the protists - the taxonomy of plants is being reconsidered.</p><p>However, we will still discuss the plants in a way that reflects our prior understanding of how these organisms evolved.</p><p>This diagram shows the four main groups of plants as well as the green algae ancestor that is most closely related to the true plants.</p><p><br>The four main groups of plants are the non-vascular plants, seedless vascular plants, non-flowering seed plants, and the flowering plants.</p><p>The true plants are thought to have evolved from a green algal ancestor known as a Charophyte.</p><p>Slide 2<br>The characteristics that are shared by plants and green algae are chlorophyll b (remember all photosynthetic organisms use chlorophyll a but only the plants and green algae use chlorophyll b), carboydrates stored as starch, a cell wall made of cellulose, and modern genetic analyses show similar DNA sequences in the two groups.</p><p><br>Slide 3<br>To understand the evolution of plants we need to understand what the earth looked like 500 million years ago.</p><p>At that time there was very little eukaryotic terrestrial life so the terrestrial environment was open for colonization.</p><p>However, UV radiation hitting the earth was too powerful - remember that UV radiation is a mutagen - it damages DNA and this damage was too much for most organisms to tolerate. &nbsp;So most life existed in the water where UV radiation cannot cause as much damage.&nbsp;</p><p>The evolution of photosynthesis was causing the accumulation of O2 that resulted in the production of the ozone layer. &nbsp;The ozone layer provides protection from UV radiation by blocking the amount of radiation that hits the surface of the earth.</p><p>The development of the ozone layer made life in a terrestrial environment more tenable.</p><p>The advantages of a terrestrial life for plants include that water attenuates light and reduces photosynthetic rates. &nbsp;Moving to land allows a great photosynthetic rate. &nbsp;There was also no herbivory on land because animals had not moved to land yet.</p><p>The disadvantages of terrestrial life include desiccation - particularly of water-sensitive gametes and embryos - and the loss of physical&nbsp;<br>support that water provides. &nbsp;Water is bouyant and gravity does not have as great an effect in water. &nbsp;<br>On land, organisms need some sort of physical support to deal with this loss of bouyancy and support.</p><p>Slide 4</p><p>The movement onto land most likely resulted when a green algal ancestor lived in shallow waters that were subject to periodic flooding and draining of the habitat.</p><p>Natural selection favored algae that could survive periods of drying out - and this set the stage for the move to land.</p><p>The colonization of land is known to have occured at least 450 mya but it may have occured earlier.</p><p>Once plants moved to land - they rapidly diversified because there was so much available habitat and very little competition from other organisms.</p><p>Slide 5<br>While we know quite a bit about plant evolution, the fossil record for some types of plants is limited because plants tend to have soft body parts. &nbsp;Generally it is organisms with hard body parts that fossilize.</p><p>However, we do have key plant fossils that have allowed us to understand the story of plant evolution.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p>
