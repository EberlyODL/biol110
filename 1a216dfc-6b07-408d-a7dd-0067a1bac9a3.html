<h2>Genetics Selection and Speciation Part 4 VoiceThread Transcript</h2><p>Slide 1<br>There are some basic steps that must take place for a speciation event to occur.</p><p>Step 1:† gene flow between two populations is interrupted&nbsp;<br>and populations become genetically isolated from each other<br>Step 2:† genetic differences gradually accumulate between the two populations &nbsp;and the populations diverge genetically<br>Step 3:† reproductive isolation evolves as a consequence of this divergence and a reproductive isolating mechanism evolves</p><p>Slide 2<br>This image from the tutorial illustrates the possible ways that populations can become reproductively isolated from each other. &nbsp;</p><p>In general, these mechanisms can be described as either pre-zygotic (occuring before a zygote forms) or post-zygotic (occuring after a zygote forms).</p><p>The prezygotic isolating mechanisms are habitat isolation, temporal isolation, behavioral isolation, mechanical isolation and gametic isolation.</p><p>Slide 3<br>An example of habitat or geographical isolation are stickleback fish species. &nbsp;</p><p>Pungitius pungitius is a brackish water form of the 9-spine stickleback (brackish water is water that is a mix of fresh water and salt water). &nbsp;These fish build their nests and reproduce in water with a salinity of 13.5% and an average temperature of 13.3 oC.</p><p>Pungitius tymensis is a freshwater form of a stickleback known as the Sakhalin stickleback. &nbsp;They overlap in range with the 9-spine stickleback but they build their nests and reproduce in water with a salinity of less than 1% and average temperature of 11.3 oC.</p><p>These reproductive preferences keep the two species separate.</p><p><br>Slide 4<br>An example of temporal isolation - or mating at different times - are the toad species Bufo americanus and Bufo fowleri. &nbsp;These toads overlap in geographic range and when in a laboratory they will mate and produce fertile offspring.</p><p>In the wild, however, Bufo americanus mates in the early summer while Bufo fowleri mates in late summer. &nbsp;</p><p>These differences in mating time keep the two species separate.</p><p><br>Slide 5<br>Behavioral differences between species can serve as reproductive isolating mechanisms. &nbsp;</p><p>Birds, fish, and mammals are well known for their elaborate courtship displays and mating calls. &nbsp;</p><p>Many organisms also release chemicals known as pheromones - these pheromones are very specific and the pheromones of one species do not attract individuals of a different species.</p><p>Slide 6<br>This series of pictures shows the mating dance of the male blue footed booby - apparently she liked his dance!</p><p><br>Slide 7<br>Mechanical isolation refers to males and females of different species being unable to mate because of mechanical incompatibility between their reproductive organs.&nbsp;</p><p>This is well documented in insects - insects have hard exoskeletons and their genitalia must fit together very precisely for mating to occur. &nbsp;Differences in genital structure serve as a reproductive isolating mechanism between species.</p><p>Slide 8<br>Gamete incompatibility refers to crosses where no offspring are produced because the gametes are incompatible and fertilization does not occur. &nbsp;This happens in many closely related species. &nbsp;</p><p>In some species, the female reproductive tract is inhospitable - this has been observed in crosses between different species of fruit flies.</p><p>Marine invertebrates, like coral for example, have external fertilization - they release their sperm and eggs into the seawater and the gametes need to find each other. &nbsp;They need to be compatible and of the same species for fertilization to take place.</p><p>This is also common in plants - the pollen from one species of plant cannot fertilize the ovules of a different species.</p>
