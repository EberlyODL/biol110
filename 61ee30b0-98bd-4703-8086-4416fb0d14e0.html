<p>As the chromosomes condense, the nuclear envelope begins to disassemble (in most eukaryotes). Dissolution of the nuclear envelope signifies further progress in mitosis, and this landmark is used to identify a cell that has successfully begun&nbsp;<strong>prometaphase</strong>.</p>
<p>The transition into&nbsp;<strong>metaphase</strong>&nbsp;represents an intricate cellular event whereby all of the chromosomes move into a line (the&nbsp;<strong>metaphase plate</strong>).</p>
<p>It is not understood how the cell "knows" when the chromosomes are precisely lined up. However, it is known that this is an important "checkpoint" and that the cell will not proceed to the next step until all of the chromosomes are properly positioned. The jostling of chromosomes can take a good deal of time. Therefore, this stage takes the longest time in most cells.</p>
