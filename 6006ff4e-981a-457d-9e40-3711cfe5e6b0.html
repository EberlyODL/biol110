<p>[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=2366|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__left__lightboxed]By now you should understand why bacteria dominate the globe. They divide rapidly, produce toxins, live just about anywhere, and are metabolically diverse. In addition, some bacteria can adopt an alternative form that allows them to survive extreme conditions. More specifically, many bacteria are able to form&nbsp;<strong>endospores</strong>&nbsp;(thickly coated, resistant cells) during harsh conditions (see image). Typically,&nbsp;<strong>sporulation</strong>&nbsp;(the formation of endospores) is triggered by a decline in key nutrients in the environment surrounding the bacteria. Some endospores can survive drying, freezing, or boiling. For this reason, it is not always sufficient to boil water to destroy all bacteria, necessitating the use of higher pressures and temperatures in an autoclave (a pressurized chamber used to sterilize laboratory equipment and other materials).</p>
