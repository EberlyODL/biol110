<h3 id="EnergyIII-CellularRespiration(KrebsCycleandElectronTransportChain)-IntroductionandLearningObjectives">Introduction and Learning Objectives</h3><p>The previous tutorial concentrated on the first stage of cellular respiration - glycolysis. You should know that glycolysis produces 2 molecules of pyruvate, 2 molecules of ATP, and 2 molecules of NADH. The pyruvate can be used in fermentation, but it can also be further metabolized in the presence of oxygen. There are many high-energy electrons left in pyruvate and thus it contains energy that can be utilized by the respiring cell. In this tutorial you will learn how cells complete cellular respiration by oxidizing pyruvate to carbon dioxide. You will also learn that these electrons are conveyed to an electron transport chain where they can participate in the synthesis of ATP. By the end of this tutorial you should have a basic understanding of:</p><ul><li>The Krebs cycle</li><li>The electron transport chain</li><li>Chemiosmosis</li><li>The energy balance of cellular respiration</li></ul><p>Performance Objectives:</p><ul><li>Illustrate the importance of redox reactions in cellular respiration</li><li>Discuss the role of electron carriers</li><li>List the Krebs Cycle inputs and outputs</li><li>Diagram the structure of the mitochondrial inner membrane</li><li>Illustrate the flow of electrons through the ETC</li><li>Demonstrate how the hydrogen ion gradient across the inner membrane is produced</li><li>Explain how ATP is produced through oxidative phosphorylation</li><li>Describe how other molecules can enter the pathways of cellular respiration at different points</li></ul><p></p>
