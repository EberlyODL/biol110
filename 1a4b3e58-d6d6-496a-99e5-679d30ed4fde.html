<p>Natural selection is one of the most important concepts in evolutionary biology because it explains how organisms can adapt to a contemporary environment, as well as to another environment at a later time. Keep in mind that natural selection is not a goal-oriented process, in the sense that organisms "know" their evolutionary trajectory. It does not lead to a "perfect organism," but it does explain how the most well-adapted organisms in a given &nbsp;environment will be more likely to have more of their alleles represented in the next generation.</p><p>Natural selection only works if variation exists in the population. Genetic mutation is one source of variation, however, a specific mutation does not arise on demand. Rather, variation is random, but selection is adaptive; beneficial, neutral and deleterious alleles arise spontaneously, but only the beneficial alleles will increase in frequency over successive generations through selection.</p><p>Does this mean that every allele is under selection? Not necessarily. Indeed, many alleles may be neither beneficial nor detrimental and so, their frequency may only change due to random events. Do not think that every alternative allele is always under selection; some may be neutral (although if conditions change, a neutral allele may become either beneficial or detrimental and subject to natural selection).</p><p>To end the course, we will consider what makes a group of organisms a species, and some current ideas about how to define species.</p>
