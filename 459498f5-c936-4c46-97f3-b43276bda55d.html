<h3 id="EnergyIV-Photosynthesis(Light-dependentReactions)-IntroductionandLearningObjectives">Introduction and Learning Objectives</h3>
<p>The majority of life on Earth could not exist without&nbsp;<strong>photosynthesis</strong>. Recall from the tutorial on Thermodynamics&nbsp;that during photosynthesis light energy is converted to chemical energy. Specifically, it is the process whereby plants, protists, and some bacteria use light, water, and carbon dioxide to make sugars. Photosynthesis is not the exact opposite of cellular respiration, but rather a separate process that just so happens to contain many similar features (e.g., an electron transport chain).</p>
<p><br>Photosynthesis can be divided into two parts: the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions (also referred to as the "dark" reactions). This tutorial will cover the light-dependenet reactions. These reactions transform light energy into chemical energy that can be used by cells. The next tutorial will cover the light-independent reactions which synthesize sugar.</p>
<p><br>By the end of this tutorial you should have an understanding of:</p>
<ul><li>Plants' requirements for photosynthesis and respiration</li><li>The light reactions of photosynthesis</li><li>Characteristics of light</li><li>Channeling of light energy</li><li>Electron transport chains and the Z-scheme</li><li>Generation of ATP.</li></ul>
