<h2>Phenotypes and Genotypes Probability Part 2 VoiceThread Transcript</h2>
<p>Slide 1<br>Phenotypes and Genotypes Probability Part 2 VoiceThread TranscriptSo, let's work through the solution to these practice problems.&nbsp; Assume you have an F1 generation that is heterozygous for 3 genes - genes A, B, and C.&nbsp; What is the probability of them having an offspring with genotype aabbcc?&nbsp; What is the probability of them having an offspring that is heterozygous for all three genes?</p>
<p>Slide 2<br>First, let's take time to determine how many gamete types each parent can make.</p>
<p>Each parent is heterozygous for three different genes.</p>
<p>Slide 3<br>Use the equation 2^n = # different gamete types, n=#heterozygous genes&nbsp;<br>In this example there are 3 heterozygous genes so each parent makes 8 different gamete types (2^3 = 8)<br>How big would the Punnett square be? &nbsp;</p>
<p>Slide 4<br>8 x 8 = 64 different squares - too big!&nbsp; So let's use probability theory.</p>
<p>Slide 5<br>So what is the probability of an offspring of genotype aabbcc?</p>
<p>Let�s look at it gene by gene:<br>Gene A:&nbsp; aa - there is a � probability of getting a from parent 1 and a � probability of getting a from parent 2 - so the overall probability is � x � = �<br>Gene B: bb - there is a � probability of getting b from parent 1 and a � probability of getting b from parent 2 - so the overall probability is � x � = �<br>Gene C: cc - there is a � probability of getting c from parent 1 and a � probability of getting c from parent 2 - so the overall probability is � x � = �</p>
<p>The overall probability is � x � x � = 1/64.&nbsp; Remember, the question is asking you what is the probability of getting genotype aa AND genotype bb AND genotype cc so you need to multiply the individual probabilities together.</p>
<p>Slide 6<br>So what is the probability of an offspring of genotype AaBbCc?</p>
<p>Let�s look at it gene by gene:<br>Gene A:&nbsp; Aa - there are two ways to be heterozygous - you can either get A from parent 1 and a from parent 2 (� x � = �) OR a from parent 1 and A from parent 2 (� x � = �) .&nbsp; You can use a Punnett square to visualize this idea.&nbsp; Notice - I am using a small 4 square Punnett square to help you visualize - not a 64 square Punnett square!</p>
<p>So the probability of an offspring having genotype Aa is 1/2 (� + � = �).&nbsp; We use both rules of probability in this example - the rule of multiplication to determine the probability of either Aa or aA and the rule of addition to calculate the overall probability of being heterozygous for A.</p>
<p>Slide 7<br>We use the same logic for genes B and C. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Gene B:&nbsp; Bb - there are two ways to be heterozygous - you can either get B from parent 1 and b from parent 2 (� x � = �) OR b from parent 1 and B from parent 2 (� x � = �) .<br>Gene C:&nbsp; Cc - there are two ways to be heterozygous - you can either get C from parent 1 and c from parent 2 (� x � = �) OR c from parent 1 and C from parent 2 (� x � = �) .&nbsp;</p>
<p>The overall probability is � x � x � = 1/8</p>
