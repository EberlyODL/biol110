<h3>Introduction and Learning Objectives</h3>
<p>All organisms - bacteria, tree frogs, fungi, people - grow and reproduce.&nbsp; For growth and reproduction to occur, cells must divide.&nbsp; In order for cells to give rise to new cells, all genetic information and cellular contents must be replicated. This tutorial and the next will focus on the cell division events that occur in eukaryotic cells - mitosis and meiosis. This tutorial will focus on mitosis and by the end of this tutorial you should have a basic working understanding of:</p>
<ul><li>The role of mitosis in the life cycle of single-celled and multicellular organisms</li><li>The phases of the cell cycle</li><li>The major chromosomal events of each stage of mitosis</li><li>Chromosome movement during the cell cycle</li></ul>
<p>Performance objectives:</p>
<ul><li>define diploid versus haploid cells</li><li>describe the stages of the cell cycle</li><li>summarize the role of mitosis in eukaryotes</li><li>be able to diagram and label the stages of mitosis</li><li>be able to explain why mitosis results in daughter cells that are genetically identical to the parent cell</li><li>explain the differences between karyokinesis and cytokinesis</li></ul>
