<p>Before we begin our study of the Calvin cycle, let's look at the energetics of sugar synthesis.</p><p>We have already studied the catabolism (breakdown) of glucose during cellular respiration. You know that the process is exergonic and releases about 686 kcal of energy. Thus, the Î”G for the overall reaction is -686 kcal/mole.</p><ul><li>glucose + O<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;--> CO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;+ H<sub>2</sub>O + ATP</li></ul><p>If 686 kcal of energy per mole are released in the process of respiration, then it follows that 686 kcal of energy (minimum) are required to produce one mole of glucose. (Remember the first law of thermodynamics?) The Calvin cycle is the process by which glucose is made, and it requires all of that energy. Where does the energy come from? The light reactions of photosynthesis produce ATP, which provides the Calvin cycle with the necessary energy. In addition, the NADPH produced by the light reactions provides the reducing power to put glucose together.</p><ul><li>sunlight + CO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;+ H<sub>2</sub>O --> O<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;+ glucose</li></ul>
