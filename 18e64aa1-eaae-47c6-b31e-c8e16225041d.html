<p>We now turn our attention to those animals that have true tissues and bilateral symmetry, the bilateria. Recall that the bilateria have a single plane of symmetry. In tandem with this single plane of symmetry is the development of advanced sensory material in the&nbsp;<strong>anterior</strong>&nbsp;(front) part of the body. The eyes of&nbsp;<strong>planaria,&nbsp;</strong>an acoelomate,&nbsp;lack the resolution of our own eyes, however, they do detect light. They are connected to a primitive brain (simple brains that contain a low number of neurons are sometimes referred to as ganglia.) The eyes are positioned to perceive new surroundings as the organism moves into new areas. This trend toward a concentration of sensory organs and nervous tissue at the anterior end of an animal&nbsp;is termed&nbsp;<strong>cephalization</strong>. Remember, the bilateria are triploblastic, possessing a third embryonic tissue layer (mesoderm).</p>
<p>Bilateria include acoelomates, pseudocoelomates, and coelomates. Acoelomates will be addressed in this tutorial, and the other two will be covered in&nbsp;the following&nbsp;tutorials.</p>

<p>The third major bifurcation of the animal phylogenetic tree distinguishes animals by whether or not they have a body cavity.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Coelomates</strong>&nbsp;have a body cavity, whereas&nbsp;<strong>acoelomates</strong>&nbsp;do not. Note, there is also a distinction made between&nbsp;<strong>pseudocoelomates</strong>&nbsp;and "true coelomates" (discussed in the next tutorial). A&nbsp;<strong>coelom</strong>&nbsp;is a fluid-lined space (body cavity) that separates the gut from the outer body wall. However, don't confuse "body cavity" with "gut" because they are not the same thing. For example, our intestines are suspended within our body cavities.</p>
<p>In an acoelomate gut, muscle contractions are not buffered by a fluid-filled body cavity; therefore, all forces generated during a contraction are transmitted throughout the animal and affect all internal organs. The coelom serves as a mechanical buffer in coelomates; it helps protect internal organs from shock. Fortunately for us, we can run and jump without bouncing our heart and lungs around too much.</p>

<p>The figure&nbsp;below illustrates the body plans of the bilateria. Note the acoelomate, pseudocoelomate and coelomate conditions. Remember, acoelomates do not have a fluid-filled body cavity, while both psuedocoelomates and coelomates have a body fluid-filled body cavity. What advantages does this cavity provide? Do you see that pseudocoelomates (e.g., nematodes) have a body cavity that is only partially lined by mesoderm-derived tissue? In contrast, the coelomates have a body cavity that is completely lined with mesoderm. Keep in mind that mesoderm gives rise to muscle (as well as other organs).</p>
