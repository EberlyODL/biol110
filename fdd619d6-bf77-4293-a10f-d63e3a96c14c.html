<h2>Protists I Part 2 VoiceThread Transcript</h2>
<p>Slide 1<br>Kingdom Euglenozoa is a monophyletic group of flagellated organisms.</p>
<p>The structure of these flagella is complex so to fill in the diversity chart on ANGEL - you just need to know that these organisms have flagella as their distinguishing characteristic.</p>
<p>Some of the euglenozoa are free living and photosynthetic and some are important parasites of humans.</p>
<p>There are two main groups of organisms in this kingdom.&nbsp; The euglenoids and the kinetoplastids.</p>
<p>Slide 2<br>The Eugleniods are mainly photosynthetic and live in freshwater. &nbsp;</p>
<p>These organisms are believed to have evolved from an ancestor that took up a green algae by a secondary endosymbiosis.&nbsp; Endosymbiosis, as we have previously learned, is a common theme in evolution.</p>
<p>Slide 3<br>The second group of Euglenzoa are the kinetoplastids.&nbsp; These organisms are distinguished by the presence of a kinetoplast, a DNA-containing granule located within the single mitochondrion associated with the base of the cell's flagella.</p>
<p>They are important human parasites and causes disease such as African sleeping sickness and Chagas disease.</p>
<p>Slide 4</p>
<p>Sleeping sickness occurs only in 36 sub-Saharan Africa countries where there are tsetse flies that can transmit the disease.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The people most exposed to the tsetse fly and therefore the disease are in rural populations dependent on agriculture, fishing, animal husbandry or hunting.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After continued control efforts, the number of cases reported in 2009 has dropped below 10,000 for first time in 50 years.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Diagnosis and treatment of the disease is complex and requires specifically skilled staff.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Slide 5<br>Chagas disease occurs mainly in rural Mexico, Central America, and South America</p>
<p>Transmitted by insects commonly referred to as "kissing bugs".</p>
<p>Affects 8-10 million people/year and ~20,000 people/year die</p>
<p>Treatment options exist but resistance to the drugs is evolving in the kinetoplastid organisms.</p>
