<p><em>Amorphophallus titanium</em>&nbsp;is a large flowering plant with a strange odor. Its nickname is “the corpse plant” and it has been described as smelling like “a rotting elephant corpse”.&nbsp; Its flower is 5-12 feet tall and it has been described as the most amazing flower on earth.&nbsp; The bloom only lasts 2-3 days and the strong odor is only produced during the first 8 hours of blooming. Male and female flowers are separate but are found on the same plant; they bloom at separate times to avoid self-fertilization.</p>
<p>It was once rumored that the large flower was pollinated by elephants; however, this is not true. When the flower is pollinated, it provides its pollinator with food. It was also rumored that this plant could eat humans – this is also not true.&nbsp; In late 2005, this plant bloomed at the U.S. Botanic Garden and thousands of people went to view it. You can see a time lapse video of that bloom at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.usbg.gov/return-titan" rel="nofollow">http://www.usbg.gov/return-titan</a></p>
