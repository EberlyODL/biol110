<p>To investigate the mutant white eye allele, Morgan mated the white-eyed male fly with a red-eyed (wild type) female. As shown in this figure, all of the F<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;offspring had red eyes, indicating that the allele for white eyes was recessive. When Morgan bred the F<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;generation flies to one another, he observed the classic 3:1 ratio of red:white eyes, however, only males had the mutant trait. All of the females and one-half of the males had the wild-type trait, which led Morgan to hypothesize that the gene that coded for eye color must be related to sex determination.</p>

<p>Like humans, female fruit flies have two&nbsp;<em>X</em>&nbsp;chromosomes (<em>XX</em>) and males have one&nbsp;<em>X</em>&nbsp;and one&nbsp;<em>Y</em>&nbsp;(<em>XY</em>). If the gene for eye color is located on the&nbsp;<em>X</em>chromosome, then this would explain why the trait rarely appears in females (i.e., a female would have to be homozygous for the recessive mutant). However, males would show the mutant trait if they have one copy of the allele because they have only one&nbsp;<em>X</em>&nbsp;chromosome and there is no corresponding gene for eye color on the&nbsp;<em>Y</em>&nbsp;chromosome. This study demonstrated that the gene for eye color in&nbsp;<em>D. melanogaster</em>&nbsp;was located on the&nbsp;<em>X</em>chromosome and provided further evidence for a chromosome theory of heredity. The X and Y chromosomes are called&nbsp;<strong>sex chromosomes</strong>&nbsp;because they determine the sex of an individual. Genes that are located on these chromosomes are called&nbsp;<strong>sex-linked genes</strong>. All other chromosomes in a cell (i.e., other than the sex chromosomes) are referred to as&nbsp;<strong>autosomes</strong>.</p>

<p>While there are several different systems for sex determination, for simplicity we will focus on the&nbsp;<strong>X-Y system</strong>&nbsp;of sex determination to examine sex-linked inheritance. During meiosis, the two&nbsp;<em>X</em>&nbsp;chromosomes (found in females) or the&nbsp;<em>X</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Y</em>&nbsp;chromosomes (found in males) pair together because they have a small region of homology, but undergo little crossing over. One of these chromosomes then goes to each gamete, so females produce gametes with only&nbsp;<em>X</em>&nbsp;chromosomes, whereas males produce equal numbers of gametes with either an&nbsp;<em>X</em>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<em>Y</em>&nbsp;chromosome. If two gametes with&nbsp;<em>X</em>chromosomes undergo fertilization, the resultant offspring will be female (<em>XX</em>). That is, if an ovum with an X chromosome and a sperm with an X chromosome combine, the resultant offspring will be female. However, if an ovum with an X chromosome and a sperm with a Y chromosome combine, the offspring will be male (<em>XY</em>). While it has long been known that the&nbsp;<em>X</em>&nbsp;chromosome contains a substantial number of genes, researchers have only recently found genes on the&nbsp;<em>Y</em>&nbsp;chromosome, most of which are associated with the development of male gonads, including the sex determining region of the Y chromosome (<strong>SRY</strong>) gene in mammals. Therefore, it appears that a gene (or genes) on the&nbsp;<em>Y</em>&nbsp;chromosome provides the biochemical signal that begins the development of male gonads in embryos.</p>

<h2 id="ChromosomeBehaviorandSexChromosomes-Sex-linkedInheritance">Sex-linked Inheritance</h2>
<p>Not only do sex chromosomes determine the sex of an individual, but the&nbsp;<em>X</em>&nbsp;chromosome also has genes that code for many characters that are not related to sex determination. Sex-linked alleles in an XY chromosome system follow the patterns of inheritance observed in Morgan's studies, in which fathers transmit these genes to their daughters, and mothers can transmit them to either sons or daughters. Females will only express recessive sex-linked traits that are homozygous, but males will express the trait coded for by their one&nbsp;<em>X</em>&nbsp;chromosome. As a result, sex-linked recessive traits are far more frequent in males than in females, although some females do exhibit sex-linked recessive traits. Since males have only one chromosomal location for sex-linked genes, the terms homozygous and heterozygous have little meaning. By convention, males are said to be&nbsp;<strong>hemizygous</strong>&nbsp;for sex-linked genes because they have half ("hemi") as many alleles as a female.</p>
<p>As with autosomal traits, you can utilize the Punnett square to study the transmission of sex-linked traits. When completing these crosses, the gametes identify the sex chromosomes only. The genes located on the&nbsp;<em>X</em>&nbsp;chromosome are indicated with superscript letters. (We will not examine any cases where we track a&nbsp;<em>Y</em>-linked gene.) As with Mendelian traits, a lowercase letter indicates a recessive allele, while an uppercase letter indicates a dominant allele. When discussing sex-linked traits, carriers (females who are heterozygous for a recessive trait) need to be considered.</p>
