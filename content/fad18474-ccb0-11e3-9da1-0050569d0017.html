<p>A VoiceThread is a collaborative, multimedia slide show that holds images, documents, and videos. It allows you to navigate pages and, most importantly, leave comments on any of the media within it. You have already viewed a VoiceThread in Lesson 3, and you will be seeing many more as small instructional pieces throughout the modules. Later on in the course you will get to create your own media and post comments on a VoiceThread of your own. In the meantime, we have <b>a required assessment in this module</b> where you will practice using VoiceThread.</p>
<p>The steps below will help you get started with VoiceThread so that you can complete the <strong>required assessment</strong> for Module 1.</p>
<h3>Step 1: Become familiar with VoiceThread</h3>
<p>Before you get started with VoiceThread, visit the <a class="ext" href="http://voicethread.psu.edu/" target="_blank">VoiceThread at Penn State</a> website. There are various resources to help get you started, including <a class="ext" href="http://voicethread.psu.edu/voicethread-at-psu-frequently-asked-questions.html" target="_blank">frequently asked questions</a> as well as a VoiceThread&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="http://psu.voicethread.com/support/forum/" target="_blank">forum</a> for tips.</p>
<h3>Step 2: Watch a VoiceThread and Leave a Comment</h3>
<p>Your first exercise in working with VoiceThread will be to leave a comment on one. To do this:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Follow this "<a class="ext" href="http://psu.voicethread.com/share/3151587/" target="_blank">VoiceThread Link</a>" to get everything set up for this course.</li>
	<li>After signing in, you should see a message that you have become a member of the group "Biology110_Summer2012_Section001" (your section number).</li>
	<li>Next, click the My Voice tab.</li>
	<li>Find the&nbsp;VoiceThread titled "<i>Bio110 Mod 1 Assignment -Section###"</i> and click on it.</li>
	<li>Click on the <b>Comment</b> button and then choose your method of leaving a comment.</li>
</ol>
<p>Listen to the instructor&#39;s comment and then comment with your name, major and any other information you would like to share.</p>
<h4>Step 3: Learn How to Create Your own VoiceThread</h4>
<p>Along with being able to make a comment on someone else&#39;s VoiceThread, you will also need to be able to create your own VoiceThread presentation. As part of the assessment for Module 01, you will be asked to:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Create your own VoiceThread,</li>
	<li>Upload an image,</li>
	<li>Make a comment and</li>
	<li>Share your VoiceThread with your TA</li>
</ul>
