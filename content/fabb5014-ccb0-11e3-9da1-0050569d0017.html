<p>Now that you have a better understanding of the calculation and use of means and standard deviations, lets explore a little about how they are used not only in science, but in popular media and advertising.</p>
<p>Because we live in a visual world, graphs are often used in newspapers, magazines, and sports statistics because they communicate information visually.</p>
<p>Scientists frequently use graphs to compare effects of variables, look at trends as they develop, and examine hypotheses. In a way, figures are a language through which scientists communicate. While the ability to interpret graphs and tables is a necessary skill in science, it also finds use in everyday life. In articles or textbooks you are likely to find graphs, yet understanding the message will often depend on being able to interpret the many different types of graphs that are presented (such as those appearing in this weeks Biol Daily Times in Lesson 03).</p>
<p>Graphs should be there to aid you, not scare you, so lets take an introductory look into the interpretation of data presented on graphs.</p>
<p>While graphs are used in all forms of media, there are a few fundamentals that you should be aware of when assessing a graph. Graphs should be &#39;stand alone&#39; items - i.e. they should not need any further explanation to make sense of them. Besides pie charts that have no axes, a reputable graph should have the following:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Graphs have a X- (horizontal) and a Y- (vertical) axis. Both the X- and the Y-axes need a label (name). This is important because the person reading the graph needs to know what they are looking at. If it just says 1, 2, 3--what do these numbers represent? It could be cats, drugs, money, fish, etc. A graph without labeled axes is meaningless.</li>
	<li>The X-axis usually holds the independent variable (normally the variable that you have control over), and the Y-axis usually holds the dependent variable (the value depends on the value of the independent variable).</li>
	<li>If the numbers used on either the X- or Y-axes contain some measurement unit (e.g. miles, pounds, dollar value, etc.), the unit measurements must accompany the axes label. Once again, the reader needs this information to be able to make sense of what they are looking at.</li>
	<li>Graphs need a title (figure legend). The figure legend provides a short explanation of what the graph represents. The figure legend ALWAYS should appear BELOW the graph. Figure legends should NEVER be placed ABOVE the graph.</li>
