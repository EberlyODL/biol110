<h3>Video: Global Swine Flu Cases Close to Pandemic</h3>
<p><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="480" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/Ea36hYuTrGA" width="640"></iframe></p>
<p>Flu (also known as influenza) spreads through populations on a yearly basis. The outbreak of H1N1 (otherwise referred to as &#39;swine&#39;) flu has been a major cause of concern globally. Despite the existence of scarier diseases caused by exotic viruses like Ebola, influenza still reigns as the number one infectious killer in modern times. Given the mobility and global nature of the modern world, the influenza virus is no doubt going to have an influence on all of our lives as we move into the future.</p>
<p>In much the same way as with climate change in Module 8, this module is totally assessment based. This module focuses on the recent H1N1 (&#39;swine&#39;) flu pandemic as a vehicle to not only broaden your knowledge on the subject of pandemics, but more importantly to put your scientific investigative skills to the test. Module 9 also serves as a "mini-version" of what is expected in your Group Projects (to be introduced in Module 10), and therefore provides you with a test run to cement your skills, to ask questions, and to get feedback before you head off into the Group Project next week.</p>
<h3>What is influenza?</h3>
<p>Although it is often confused with the common cold, influenza (commonly referred to as the flu) is a much more severe disease than the common cold and is caused by a different type of virus that affects both birds and mammals (<a class="ext" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza" target="_blank">additional information on influenza</a>). Influenza is typically transmitted through the air by coughs or sneezes, and the most common symptoms of the disease include chills, fever, sore throat, muscle pains, severe headache, coughing, weakness/fatigue, and general discomfort. In more serious cases, influenza causes pneumonia, which can be fatal, particularly for the young and the elderly. Influenza usually spreads around the world in seasonal epidemics, resulting in the deaths of between 250,000 and 500,000 people every year. However, the death toll can rise into the millions in pandemic years.</p>
<h3>What is a pandemic?</h3>
<p>The word pandemic originates from the Greek words &#39;pan&#39; (meaning &#39;all&#39;) and &#39;demos&#39; (meaning &#39;people&#39;) and is used to describe an epidemic that affects the whole population across every continent. An influenza pandemic occurs when:</p>
<ul>
	<li>a new subtype of influenza virus emerges in humans to which most people have not been previously exposed and are, therefore, highly susceptible.</li>
	<li>the virus causes serious disease in humans.</li>
	<li>the virus is easily and rapidly spread between humans, infecting large numbers of people worldwide and causing many deaths.</li>
</ul>
<p>Prior to the recent swine flu outbreak, there have been three major influenza pandemics that have had a significant impact on the world population:</p>
<ol>
	<li>The Spanish flu of 1918 has been the worst influenza pandemic to date, whereby 25% of the world&#39;s population was infected with the virus, resulting in an estimated death toll of 50 million people (exceeding the number of people killed during the entire duration of World War 1).&nbsp;</li>
	<li>The Asian flu in 1957 resulted in an estimated death toll of 2 million people.</li>
	<li>The Hong Kong flu in 1968 resulted in an estimated death toll of 1 million people.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<p>According to the World Health Organization, as of February 19, 2010, it is estimated that approximately 16,000 people worldwide have died from the recent H1N1 (&#39;swine&#39;) flu virus.&nbsp; While this may seem like a rather low number compared to the 1918, 1957, and 1968 pandemics, the rapid spread of the recent H1N1 (&#39;swine&#39;) flu virus across the world is a cause for alarm and the relatively low death rate to date is also likely to be a function of better health standards, improved communications, and global organizations monitoring and addressing the pandemic in real-time worldwide.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the threat of the swine flu is not yet over and there is no place for complacency at this stage. The recent H1N1 (&#39;swine&#39;) flu is just a modern tangible example of the threat of pandemics (<a class="ext" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandemic" target="_blank">additional information on pandemics</a>) -- the impacts of which go way beyond the direct health issues to having both global social and economic ramifications.</p>
<h3>Module 9 Assessment Notes</h3>
<p>The H1N1 (&#39;swine&#39;) flu virus has had a major impact on countries and people all around the world. Penn State is no different and this module requires your scientific logic and problem-solving abilities to be put to good use as a contracted consultant to address the very real H1N1 ramifications for Penn State. The Penn State administrators have compiled a list of resources and a research question, which are available in the Module 9 assessment in ANGEL. You are required to use the resources provided to address the research question and produce a scientific report.</p>
<h3>Module 9 Wrap Up</h3>
<p>If you have any questions, please email the instructor via ANGEL. Alternatively, if there is anything in this module that you would like to comment on, or add to, please visit the "Course Feedback" link in the top menu.</p>
