<p>If you have ever watched Animal Planet or Discovery Channel, you will be familiar with Sir David Attenborough. He is probably the best-known natural history filmmaker, whose career as a naturalist and broadcaster has spanned nearly five decades. There are very few places on this Earth that he has not visited.</p>

<p>The good news is that you do not need a science degree to be able to understand science. We as humans have a big brain that enables us to explain how things work by using methodical, objective, and rational observation and analysis--thereby setting us apart from other species such as those that appear in Sir David Attenborough&#39;s movies. &nbsp;However, curiosity and casual observation can only get us so far in today&#39;s fast paced world where there are a number of issues that require some understanding of science.</p>
<p>Lab Module 2 will cover a description of the scientific method.</p>
