<div>Scientific thinking is an important element in the study of a wide range of topics--from economics, through health, to the environment. We will focus on biology (or the study of living things), and using real‐world examples we will develop a new level of biological literacy.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Biological literacy is the ability to:<br />
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	<ul>
		<li>Use the method of scientific inquiry to think creatively about real‐world biological (e.g. health and environment) issues.</li>
		<li>Integrate these ideas into decision-making processes.</li>
	</ul>
</div>
<div>Biological issues such as obesity, stem cell research, genetically modified crops, swine flu, fossil fuel use, and global warming appear frequently in the news, and as such, they have become politically charged subjects. An enhanced biological literacy level should help you to make wiser, more informed decisions for yourself, and ultimately, for society at large.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Science is an integral part of technology, and where this course probably differs from other courses, is that we are using and integrating new web-based technologies to enhance the learning environment. In doing so, this course is:<br />
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	<ul>
		<li>Contemporary - integrates real-world issues into the course content.</li>
		<li>Flexible - it is online so you can manage your own time and decide when and where you want to learn.</li>
		<li>Multidisciplinary - while we are focusing on biology, many of the skills learned will be directly transferable to other disciplines (science or non-science).</li>
	</ul>
</div>
<p>In addition, you will be developing digital literacy skills that will be beneficial in your future post-university years.</p>
