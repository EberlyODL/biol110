<h2>"How do I know that it is true?"</h2>
<p>This is a question that you have no doubt asked yourself a hundred times before. It is also a very important question in today&#39;s world. Lets start by looking at a common example that we are faced with in everyday life.</p>

	<li>Pseudoscience - where people make scientific‐sounding claims that are not supported by valid scientific studies - e.g. 4 out of 5 doctors recommend drug X to cure backache.

These statements are often used to try and sell products.</li>
	<li>Anecdotal observations ‐ where people conclude that there is a link between things based on a single or very few observations - e.g. you hear of a cancer patient that beat the odds by drinking prune juice. It may seem harmless but they don&#39;t include large or representative observations, and can therefore lead people to make incorrect conclusions.</li>
