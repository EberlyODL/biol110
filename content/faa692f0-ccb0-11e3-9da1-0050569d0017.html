<h4>Interactive Exercise: Samples</h4>
<p>Using the following <a class="ext" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AqxezcRo0MfFdGRUWndDUlczN2xoUFdreDR3WjhIYVE#gid=0" target="_blank">Google Spreadsheet file</a>, practice using Google Spreadsheets to calculate the Mean and Standard Deviation for the 3 different sample sizes.</p>
<p>Once completed, think about how both the Mean and Standard Deviation change with increasing sample sizes.</p>
