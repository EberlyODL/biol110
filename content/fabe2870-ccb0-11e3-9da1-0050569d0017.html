<h2>Project Description</h2>
<p>During the course you have developed an enhanced knowledge of the scientific method, a better appreciation for how science works, as well as how science is reported in the media.&nbsp; Armed with these new skills, you are in a fortunate position to be able to think critically and ask educated and investigative questions.&nbsp; As part of your assessment for the course, you are required to complete a small project with the end result being a VoiceThread that answers a biological (health or environment) question of your choice.&nbsp; While the higher level of the project has formal constraints, you are highly encouraged to be as creative as possible in creating your VoiceThread presentations.</p>
<p>The old saying, "you can&#39;t believe everything you read" is very true and you are therefore required to do some scientific investigative journalism on a biological topic of your choice, whereby you use supporting evidence to back statements and claims.</p>

<h2>Module 10 Structure</h2>
<p>Module 10 will be completed over the next four weeks and is broken up into eight lessons to help you pace yourselves as you complete your project. Below is a brief description of each lesson.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Lesson 01: this lesson introduces you to the project and Module 10 as a whole.</li>
	<li>Lesson 02: goes over the project requirements.</li>
	<li>Lesson 03: describes the project timeline.</li>
	<li>Lessons 04-07: describes the project work.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Lesson 08: Module and Course Evaluation</li>

<h2>Need Help?</h2>
<p>We have created a page dedicated with helpful resources for your project. This page is accessible via the <b>Project Help Resources Tab</b> above. There you will find information about the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>whom to contact if you have questions about your research question</li>
	<li>whom to contact if you have technical issues with VoiceThread</li>
	<li>links to VoiceThread tutorials and instructions</li>
	<li>links to sources for images for your project</li>
	<li>links to resources on using references and project tips</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to the <b>Project Help Resources</b> page, we have also created an <span class="ext"><b>ANGEL Discussion Forum</b></span> dedicated to this project. There you can ask questions and see if other students are seeking the same information that you are. The answer to your question might already be there!</p>
