		<h2>Sometimes questions arise as to who to contact about a certain issue and where.&nbsp; Use the information below to guide you in seeking answers to your questions.</h2>
		<h4>For general questions about the course content and activities...</h4>
		<p>If you have any questions about the course content or activities, at any point in the course, please post them to our <em>Questions?</em> discussion forum (instead of using private e-mail), located under the <tt>Communicate</tt> tab in ANGEL. That way everyone can benefit from seeing the question and the answer! I will check that discussion forum at least once per day, Monday through Friday, to respond. While you are there, feel free to post your own responses if you, too, are able to help out a classmate!</p>
		<h4>For questions of a personal nature...</h4>
		<p>If you have a question that you would prefer not to share with the rest of the class, such as about your grade, you are welcome to contact me by email, via ANGEL, anytime. I usually am able to respond within 24 hours. Although e-mail correspondence is preferred, students may also contact me by telephone (see our syllabus for contact information) from 9.00 a.m. to 5.00 p.m. EST, Monday through Friday. You should expect that all messages will be received and answered within 24 hours, but in rare cases it may take me longer to get back to you.</p>
		<h4>For technical issues related to this website...</h4>
		<p>Please contact</p>
		<h4>For technical questions related to ANGEL...</h4>
		<p>If you experience technology problems of any kind (course Web site, ANGEL), please report them to ANGEL Support, preferably AT THE EXACT MOMENT that they occur.&nbsp; That way the <a class="ext" href="http://angelkb.ais.psu.edu/article.asp?article=1417&p=2" target="_blank">ANGEL Support</a> team will be able to validate glitches and fix system problems as they occur.</p>
		<p>It is in your own best interest to be as specific as you possibly can. Vague descriptions of a problem only delay assistance. Try to include information such as:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Indicate the specific course page, quiz question, etc. you were on, what you attempted to do when that failed, and <strong>the exact language of any error message</strong> displayed on your screen</li>
			<li>The date and time when your problem occurred</li>
			<li>Any other pertinent information (does the problem happen consistently and always in the same way, etc.)</li>
		</ul>
		<p>A member of ANGEL support will be in contact with you to assist you.</p>
