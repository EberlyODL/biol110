		<h6>Is this sufficient? Is this a form or plagiarism or academic dishonesty? Why or why not?</h6>
		<p><strong>Response 1: </strong><em>This is an example of sloppy work that could result in serious consequences. It is important to CORRECTLY cite all sources of information. "Internet" is not a correct citation. It is also dangerous to include information in a research paper that was found on the Web but that can&#39;t be verified. </em></p>
		<p><strong>Response 2:</strong><em> It is not plagiarism because he provides a citation, but he does need more information. Most scholars recommend an Internet citation include the specific URL, and the author of the site, and when the site was created. If no dates can be found, then putting down when the site was viewed is sufficient. </em></p>
		<p><strong>Response 3: </strong><em>This is a form of plagiarism. There are several correct ways to cite Internet sources. Students can find information at online sites, such as: <a class="ext" href="http://www.bedfordstmartins.com/online/citex.html" target="_blank">http://www.bedfordstmartins.com/online/citex.html</a>, or&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="http://www.apastyle.org/elecref.html" target="_blank">http://www.apastyle.org/elecref.html</a>. If Lee finds it necessary to use the material compiled by the woman who did not cite her resources, at the very least he should quote her directly and cite her as the primary source. I would avoid using her material, however, no matter how good it is. If she obtained it from different resources, chances are he could also search out the original resources she used and cite properly any material directly quoted.</em></p>
