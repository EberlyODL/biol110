<p>Hopefully by now the age old myth that science is boring and not relevant to your life is slowly disappearing, as science affects you from the time you wake up until the time you finally go to sleep. Your alarm clock, the weather report, the asphalt you drive on, the bus or car that you ride in, your cell phone, your mp3 player, the tablets that treat your headache (yes you know why), the clean water that comes from your faucet, and the light that you turn off at the end of the day have all been brought to you courtesy of science. While scientific knowledge improves your quality of life, an understanding of science is imperative in the modern world in guiding your decisions on issues such as energy, conservation, agriculture, health, transportation, communication, defense, and economics.</p>
<p>If you are not planning on becoming an active academic scientist, you probably will never get to set-up and do your own experiment, but it is useful to have a good understanding of the scientific method. While much of the scientific information that you will read will probably come from the popular media and/or books, most of this research will first have been published in scientific journals (primary literature). Hundreds of scientific articles are published each week covering disciplines from health to environmental sciences.</p>
<p>Unless you plan on becoming an active scientist, it is unlikely that you will ever read the primary scientific literature. However, much of the scientific information that you will read will probably come from the popular media, which often reports on research that was first published in the primary scientific literature. So lets just take a quick look at the scientific publication process.</p>
