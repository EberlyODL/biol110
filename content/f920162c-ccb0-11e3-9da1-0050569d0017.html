<p>Instructors are asked (<a class="ext" href="http://www.psu.edu/ufs/policies/47-00.html#49-20" target="_blank">Senate Rule 49-20</a>) to provide at the beginning of a course a statement to clarify the application of academic integrity criteria to that course. The Senate Rule includes the following:</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>Integrity is the pursuit of scholarly activity in an open, honest and responsible manner. Academic integrity is a basic guiding principle for all academic activity at The Pennsylvania State University, and all members of the University community are expected to act in accordance with this principle. Consistent with this expectation, the <a class="ext" href="http://studentaffairs.psu.edu/judicial/codeofconduct/" target="_blank">University&#39;s Code of Conduct</a> states that all students should act with personal integrity, respect other students&#39; dignity, rights and property, and help create and maintain an environment in which all can succeed through the fruits of their efforts.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Academic integrity includes a commitment by all members of the University community not to engage in or tolerate acts of falsification, misrepresentation or deception. Such acts of dishonesty violate the fundamental ethical principles of the University community and compromise the worth of work completed by others.</p>
<p>All <a class="ext" href="http://www.psu.edu/dept/oue/aappm/G-9.html" target="_blank">Penn State</a> and <a class="ext" href="http://www.science.psu.edu/academic/Integrity/Policy.html" target="_blank">Eberly College of Science</a> academic Integrity polices and procedures regarding ethics and honorable behavior apply to this course.
