<p>You now have a better understanding of the scientific method and how science works, so you should be in a better position to evaluate the constant information thrown at you via the Internet, television, radio, newspaper, magazine, or advertisement. Using your new-found knowledge in combination with this "science in the media checklist" should increase your scientific literacy significantly.</p>

<p>Using this simple checklist should help in separating the fact from the fiction. However, you may not be able to get answers to all the boxes, but the more marks in the green boxes should indicate a more trustworthy source than a list riddled with red box marks. Lets expand on this checklist and take a closer look behind the boxes.</p>
<h3>Interactive Exercise: Science in Media Checklist</h3>
<p>Try this interactive exercise to learn more details about each of the six elements of the science in media checklist.</p>

<p>Not all the necessary information will always be presented to tick all the boxes in the list. Clearly, the more boxes you can tick, the better your appraisal of the media report will be. A good source should provide much of the information needed to address all boxes, but if you are unsure or require additional information, you can always contact the scientist(s) directly or go back to the original scientific journal article, which not only contains the original information, but is free of media bias.</p>
<p>If you do not have the checklist, remember these few key questions to guide you:</p>
<ul>
	<li>What&#39;s the claim?</li>
	<li>Who is making the claim?</li>
	<li>What&#39;s the evidence?</li>
	<li>Does the data support the claim?</li>
	<li>Could there be another explanation?</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, keep in mind the hype factor. Big news sells, and science stories are easy prey for people looking to make mountains out of mole hills. Journalists often misquote or spin the quotes from scientists to support their story agenda. So NEVER take headlines or sound bites at face value, as there is undoubtedly more to the story. That said, reading the BBC or New York Times Science/Health/Environment news is a good first pass to obtain somewhat balanced reporting to keep up to date with the exciting scientific discoveries that are shaping our lives.</p>
