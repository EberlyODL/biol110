<p>Unless you plan on becoming an active scientist, it is unlikely that you will ever troll through and read the primary scientific literature every week. Instead, you will probably get your scientific information from secondary sources like the popular media. Even in these secondary sources you are constantly confronted with claims about household products, technology, medicine, and even politics--often steeped in the presumed authority of scientific research. These media representations of science and science-related policy are essential for quickly communicating scientific messages to the broad public, however, some important parts of the scientific message can easily get lost or garbled in translation. As such, 76% of US scientists believe that the news media does a poor job at educating the public and believe that a major problem for science is that news reports fail to distinguish between findings that are well-founded and those that are not.</p>
<h2>How can you as a non-scientist decide what to believe?</h2>

<p>An original piece of scientific research is often adapted into a simplified press release, which is picked up by reporters and translated again into a newspaper, magazine, or Internet article. Needless to say, details can very easily be lost in this chain. However, an understanding of the scientific method and the nature of science are useful skills to make you a better-informed consumer of these media messages and policies, and therefore separate science fact from science fiction.</p>
