<p>This tutorial&nbsp;began our exploration of vascular plants. In particular, we examined the significance of their vascular tissue. Vasculature provides plants with a means to transport materials and aids upright growth in the terrestrial environment. Ferns were used as a representative of seedless vascular plants to examine their life cycle. We learned that the sporophyte is the dominant generation and that this diploid condition can provide plants with an advantage against the damaging effects of the sun. While the &nbsp;sporophyte generation begins its life in the protection of the archegonium, the sporophyte and gametophyte live separately for part of the life cycle. During this time the gametophyte is either photosynthetic or has a symbiotic relationship with a fungus that provides its nutrition.</p>
<p>This tutorial also examined the evolution of the seed plants.&nbsp;&nbsp;The seed plants show adaptations to drier environments.&nbsp; First, we considered changes in the alternation of generations during land plant evolution. Then, we learned the importance of pollen and seeds in the development of land plants. We explored the diversity of extant members of the nonflowering seed plants (gymnosperms), as well as their evolutionary past.&nbsp; By looking at the life cycle of a pine, we compared and contrasted the life cycles of seedless plants and nonflowering seed plants</p>
