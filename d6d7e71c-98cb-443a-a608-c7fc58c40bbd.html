<h3>Introduction and Learning Objectives</h3>
<p>It has long been noted that offspring resemble their parents in many ways, and that traits are often passed from one generation to the next. This is evident in the physical similarities of siblings, and in offspring and their parents. Although there are definite similarities between parents and offspring (and between offspring), there is also variation. After all, children never look entirely like either of their parents because they have inherited traits from both parents. Variation between generations is an important feature of natural selection because it provides the genetic basis of differential reproductive success. This tutorial will examine how chromosomes are passed from parents to offspring, and how this process gives rise to genetic variation in offspring. By the end of this tutorial you should be familiar with:</p>
<ul><li>Asexual and sexual reproduction</li><li>Sexual life cycles</li><li>Meiosis</li><li>The two sources of genetic variation during meiosis</li></ul>
<p>Performance objectives:</p>
<ul><li>Discuss sexual versus asexual reproduction</li><li>Identify the major features of an animal life cycle</li><li>Describe the role of meiosis in eukaryotes, and its effect on chromosome number</li><li>Draw the major features of meiosis</li><li>Diagram the process of independent assortment and calculate the number of different chromosome combinations independent assortment can produce</li><li>Diagram crossing-over in a homologous pair of chromosomes</li><li>Demonstrate how events in meiosis affect heredity</li></ul>
