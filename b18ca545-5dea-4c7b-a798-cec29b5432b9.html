<p>A great deal of life on the planet depends on prokaryotes, either directly or indirectly. Many prokaryotes form intimate associations with other species. These symbiotic relationships can take on a variety of forms. At one extreme are the mutualistic relationships. In a mutualistic symbiosis, both species derive benefit from the association; the bacteria that live in our lower digestive tract provide us with a number of vitamins and, in turn, we provide them with a source of carbon from the food we do not digest ourselves. At the other extreme is a parasitic symbiosis, in which the symbiont benefits at the expense of the host. Such parasitic bacteria are usually termed pathogenic because they can cause serious diseases. Microbiologists have provided us with an appreciation for prokaryotes, and their discoveries have led to new opportunities for using prokaryotes to better humanity and to combat diseases caused by pathogenic bacteria.</p>
<p>Prokaryotes are an important component of ecosystems. The saprophytes degrade material from dead organic matter, and in doing so make nitrogen and carbon available to other life forms. Without them, nutrients would quickly be tied up in the carcasses of dead organisms and unavailable for other organisms in the ecosystem.</p>
<p>Nitrogen is necessary for the synthesis of amino acids. As with carbon, bacteria obtain their nitrogen from various sources. Some bacteria can convert ammonia into a more useful form of nitrogen (like nitrates and nitrites). Saprophytic bacteria obtain their nitrogen from decaying organic matter, whereas nitrogen-fixing bacteria obtain their nitrogen from molecular nitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>) found in the atmosphere.</p>
<p>Cyanobacteria not only fix their own nitrogen from the air, but they also synthesize their own sugars from carbon dioxide, using sunlight as an energy source. They may be the most efficient form of life on the planet. Indeed, the ancestors of blue-green algae played an important role in the history of the planet because their photosynthetic activity converted our planet's early anaerobic environment into one that is oxygen rich.</p>
<p>We also examined the relationships between oxygen and metabolism, and &nbsp;later in the course we will explore, in more detail, the relationship between energy and metabolic processes.</p>
