<p>The world is comprised of organic and inorganic compounds.&nbsp;<strong>Inorganic compounds</strong>&nbsp;include water and mineral rocks. An inorganic compound does not contain carbon (with the exception of CO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;and several other C-containing molecules which are classified as inorganic molecules). In contrast,<strong>organic compounds</strong>&nbsp;contain carbon and are prevalent in living systems. They provide us with colors, tastes, and odors, along with the abilities to perceive and respond to our environment. In other words, carbon compounds are essential to our existence. What is it about carbon that makes it so fundamental to life on Earth?&nbsp; Carbon has four&nbsp;<strong>electrons</strong>&nbsp;(a negatively charged part of an atom) in its outermost orbital. This&nbsp;<strong>valence</strong>&nbsp;of four allows each carbon atom to form stable associations with up to four other atoms, including other carbon atoms. Carbon can form single, double, or triple bonds. That is, it can share one, two, or three of its valence electrons with another atom. By convention, a single, double, or triple line is used to denote these different types of bonds. A single carbon atom bound to another carbon atom is the building block for a seemingly endless variety of chain- and ring-structured molecules. The images on this page represent a small portion of the thousands of organic compounds that exist.</p>

<p>In this tutorial we will address four classes of large organic compounds (<strong>macromolecules</strong>): carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids. Note that three of these (carbohydrates, proteins, and nucleic acids) are actually formed through the synthesis of many similar or identical building blocks. These building blocks (monomers) are linked to form polymers. The general process of joining monomers to form a polymer is termed&nbsp;<strong>anabolism</strong>, which can involve many steps. Conversely, a polymer can be broken down into its monomers by&nbsp;<strong>catabolism</strong>, which also can involve multiple steps.</p>
