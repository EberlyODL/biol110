<h2>Carbon and Life Part 2 VoiceThread Transcript&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Slide 1<br>Carbon has four electrons in its outermost orbital - but there is room for 8 electrons in this shell. This valence of four allows each carbon atom to form stable associations with up to four other atoms, including other carbon atoms.</p>
<p>Slide 2<br>Carbon can form single, double, or triple bonds. That is, it can share one, two, or three of its valence electrons with another atom.</p>
<p>This allows carbon to serve as the backbone for an almost endless array of organic molecules.</p>
<p>Slide 3<br>Long chains of carbon atoms are common. The chains may be branched or form rings.</p>
<p>Slide 4<br>Metabolism is the set of chemical reactions that happen in living organisms to maintain life.</p>
<p>These processes allow organisms to grow and reproduce, maintain their structures, and respond to their environments.</p>
<p>Anabolism uses energy to construct components of cells and<br>catabolism breaks down organic matter, for example to harvest energy.</p>
<p>Slide 5<br>The normal functioning of cells and organisms requires both anabolic and catabolic reactions. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Most macromolecules are polymers - long chains of repeating units.&nbsp; These polymers are built up during anabolic dehydration reactions (sometimes referred to as condensation reactions).&nbsp; During dehydration synthesis - a molecule of water is lost as covalent bond is formed between the exising polymer and a monomer.</p>
<p>Polymers are broken down during catabolic hydrolysis reactions.&nbsp; A hydrolysis reaction uses a molecule of water to break a covalent bond between two units in a polymer.</p>
<p>As we talk more about the activities inside a cell we will see that polymers are always being built up and broken down to maintain life.&nbsp;</p>
