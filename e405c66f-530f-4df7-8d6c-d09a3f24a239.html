<h2>Genetics Selection and Speciation Part 1 VoiceThread Transcript</h2><p>Slide 1<br>In this tutorial we are discussing the different modes of natural selection. &nbsp;Recall that natural selection is best defined as differential reproduction - which we now know means that those individuals with greater fitness pass on more copies of their genes to the next generation.</p><p>This results in an adaptive allele frequency change within the population.</p><p>Remember that natural selection requires variation in the population - the trait that is being selected for must be heritable and must contribute to an increase in fitness.</p><p><br>Slide 2<br>A classic example of natural selection in action is the pepper moth and industrial melanism. &nbsp;Melanin in the pigment that results in dark coloration in the moth and other organisms, &nbsp;</p><p>There are two forms of the moth: one mottled (light-colored) and one black. In natural conditions, the mottled phenotype is more common because it mimics lichen on trees and thus birds tend to prey on the black moth.&nbsp;</p><p>You can see on this image that in the light colored background the light colored moth is hard to see. &nbsp;In a dark colored background, the dark colored moth is difficult to see.</p><p><br>Slide 3<br>During the Industrial Revolution, soot from factories darkened the trees and poor air quality destroyed the lichen. This resulted in a shift of the phenotype frequency curve because the mottled phenotype became more visible to predators, and thus became the prey of choice for birds. &nbsp;The environment selected for dark colored moths.</p><p>This graphic shows what happened to the frequency of dark colored moths in the population after clean air regulations were enacted. &nbsp;Better air quality allowed the lichens to recolonize the tree trunks and the moths environment became predominantly light colored again. &nbsp;Once again, the environment favored light colored moths and the percentage of dark colored moths has decreased significantly.</p><p><br>Slide 4<br>Natural selection results in adpative change in populations. &nbsp;But how is this change noticed? &nbsp;By observing the changes that take place the distribution of the phenotype in the population.</p><p>We can describe the type of selection that is happening by observing these changes in the population.</p><p>The types of selection are: Stabilizing Selection,<br>Directional Selection, Diversifying Selection, Balancing Selection, and Sexual Selection.</p><p><br>Slide 5<br>To discuss this issue we will think about traits that are distributed around a median phenotype. &nbsp;In the original population the phenotype is distributed in a normal distribution or a bell curve. &nbsp;The different types of selectoin affect which part of the distribution is selected.</p><p>Slide 6<br>Stabilizing selection occurs in stable environments where there is very little change occuring in the environment. &nbsp;in this type of selection the mean phenotype is selected for while the extreme phenotypes are selected against. &nbsp;This culls out variants and results in a population with a more limited range of phenotypes.</p><p><br>Slide 7<br>A nice example of stabilizing selection is birth weight in humans. &nbsp;The birth weight of nearly 7000 human female babies were recorded in London.</p><p>After one month, survival of these babies was determined as a function of birth weight<br>Overall survival was 95.9%<br>-Babies less than 4.5 lb had 41.4% survival&nbsp;<br>-babies 7.5 -8.5 lb had 98.5 survival&nbsp;<br>-Babies greater than 10.0 lb had 90.5% survival</p><p>Babies that are born too small or too large are selected against and babies between 7.5 and 8.5 pounds are selected for. &nbsp;This is an example of stabilizing selection.</p><p>Slide 8<br>Directional selection is common in environments that are changing and an extreme phenotype is selected for. &nbsp;We have already learned about the Galapagose finches evolving a thicker, stronger beak in response to a drought and the peppered moth evolving to a darker color morph in response to a darkening of their environment. &nbsp;These are examples of directional selection.</p><p>Slide 9<br>In Diversifying (also referred to as disruptive) selection both extremes are selected for and the mean phenotype is selected against. &nbsp;This results in a bimodal distribution in the population.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Slide 10<br>An amusing example of disruptive selection can be seen in the Horned Dung beetles of Australia. &nbsp;In this species, male dung beetles have either large horns or no horns. &nbsp;</p><p>Males with large horns guard the tunnels in which female beetles lay eggs. &nbsp;Mate with females and keep other males away.</p><p>Males with no horns dig side tunnels to sneak into the female tunnels, bypass guarding males and mate with females</p><p>Males with intermediate horns would not be as good at guarding tunnels, and would not be as good at sneaking matings. &nbsp;The result is there are two male phenotypes - large horns or no horns.</p><p></p>
