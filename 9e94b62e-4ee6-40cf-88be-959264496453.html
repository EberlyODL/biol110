<p>Members of the kingdom Fungi produce spores. Although they are mostly nonmotile (some members of the Chytridiomycota produce flagellated spores), spores (produced by the thousands or millions) can be dispersed by water and/or wind great distances to another available substrate or host. Spores are an important taxonomic character and, as expected, come in an array of shapes and sizes. Spores can be mitotically or meiotically produced, affording the organism flexibility to reproduce and proliferate over a variety of environmental conditions where sexual recombination may not be feasible.</p>

<p>Fungi play many roles in the biosphere. As you have already learned, they are important decomposers as well as plant and human pathogens. They also engage in extremely important symbiotic relationships with plants and algae.&nbsp;<strong>Mycorrhizae</strong>&nbsp;are an intimate association (symbiosis) between plant roots and fungal hyphae. The vast majority are mutualistic, with the plant or tree benefiting with increased water and nutrient uptake and the fungus obtaining carbon from the roots. &nbsp;All of the members of the glomeromycetes are participants in a mycorrhizal relationship with a plant.Symbioses with lichens are also common. Specific fungal species (usually Ascomycetes) grow in concert with green algae, or occasionally a cyanobacterium. The fungus gains carbon from the photosynthetic partner, and in turn it provides moisture to its photosynthetic parnter. This is a unique relationship since lichens can grow in extremely harsh climates (e.g., the arctic tundra and bare rocks) in which the algae or bacteria might not normally survive individually.&nbsp;the&nbsp;<em>Cordyceps</em>&nbsp;genus of fungi exhibits a novel method of entomopathogenesis, hijacking the nervous systems of certain insects. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Another symbiotic relationship between fungi and other species are the <strong>lichens</strong>.&nbsp; Lichens are a composite organism comprised of three partners - an ascomycete fungus, a basidiomycete fungus (both discussed in the next tutorial) as well as a photosynthetic partner – either an algae or a cyanobacterium.&nbsp; For over 150 years, scientists thought that the lichens consisted of only two partners – an ascomycete and a photosynthetic partner.&nbsp; It is only since 2016 that scientists have had the molecular tools necessary to discover the third basidiomycete partner.</p>
<p>Lichens are considered “pioneer species” because they are usually the first organisms to colonize an area of bare rock in an environment that has been denuded by a disaster.&nbsp; Over time, lichens can degrade the rocks on which they are living; the degraded rocks are turned into soil which leads the way for the movement of plants and other species into the environment.&nbsp;</p>
