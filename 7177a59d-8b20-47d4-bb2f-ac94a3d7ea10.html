<p>Of the roughly 900 described species in the Zygomycota, most are terrestrial and exist as saprobes in soil, on decaying plant material or on animal dung.&nbsp; Many common bread molds (e.g.,&nbsp;<em>Rhizopus stolonifer</em>) are&nbsp;<strong>zygomycetes</strong>. Morphologically, they have coenocytic hyphae, with septa formed only in association with reproductive structures. The phylum gets it name from the production of the&nbsp;<strong>zygosporangium</strong>.

<p>The image below illustrates the events in the life cycle of a zygomycete. Concentrate on the top portion of the diagram. As you have learned, two different haploid mating types are often required for sexual reproduction in the fungi. First,gametangia begin to form on hyphae of different mating types, “+” and “-“ (step 1). The gametangia then fuse (step 2) to form the heterokaryotic state (step 3). The heterokaryotic zygosporangium then develops (step 4). The zygosporangium develops a rough and thickened cell wall, which renders it resistant to harsh "over-wintering" conditions. When conditions become favorable for&nbsp;<strong>zygospore</strong>&nbsp;germination, the nuclei fuse (karyogamy) and a diploid is briefly formed (step 5). Meiosis immediately follows and millions of haploid zygospores are formed in the sporangium by mitosis (step 6). The zygosporangium germinates and releases the spores and the cycle begins again (step 7). The asexual stage alternates between mycelial growth and asexual spore production (as shown in bottom part of figure).
