<h2>Prokaryotes III Part 1 VoiceThread Transcript</h2>
<p>Slide 1<br>Symbiotic relationships refer to long term associations between two different species.&nbsp; We classify symbiotic relationships according to how the two species are affected.</p>
<p>A mutualism is relationship in which both species benefit (we indicate this with a +,+).</p>
<p>A commensalism is a relationsip in which one species benefits and the other species is relatively unaffected (indicated with a + and 0).</p>
<p>Parasitism is a relationship in which the parasite benefits and the host organism is harmed (indicated with a + and -).</p>
<p>Slide 2</p>
<p>As an example of mutualism we can look at the pea aphid and its bacterial endosymbiont.&nbsp; An endosymbiont is an organism that lives inside its symbiotic partner.</p>
<p>The pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum, is an insect pest that sucks the juices from its host plant. However, plant sap is deficient in several essential amino acids.<br>The pea aphid thrives nonetheless thanks to specialized cells within its body that contain the gamma proteobacterium, Buchnera aphidicola, that can live nowhere else.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The genome of this endosymbiotic Gram-negative bacterium encodes a number of enzymes needed to complete the synthesis of the amino acids needed by its host.</p>
<p>In return, the aphid's genome encodes enzymes needed by Buchnera to synthesize its lipopolysaccharide cell wall and has lost genes that might otherwise repel infection by Gram-negative bacteria.</p>
<p>Slide 3<br>As an example of commensalism we can think about all of the different bacteria that live in us and on us.&nbsp; Some of these are mutualists that help us synthesize vitamins and avoid infection by nasty bacteria.&nbsp; Some are these nasty parasite bacteria that can make us sick.&nbsp; But many are commensalistic - at least as far as we know.&nbsp; They live in us and on us and we are relatively unaffected.</p>
<p>In fact, the human intestine has an insane number of bacteria - somewhere in the number of 100 trillion.&nbsp; Some biologists have suggested that the human intestine has the highest cell density on earth!</p>
<p>It is important to remember that symbiotic relationships can change when the environment changes.&nbsp; For example, it is very dangerous to experience a stomach wound - all of these bacteria that live in our intestines and cause no problems - can become quite dangerous if the stomach wall is breached and the bacteria get into our blood stream. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Slide 4<br>A dramatic example of parasitism is the gram negative bacterium Yersinia pestis - which is responsible for the disease known as the plague or the black death.</p>
<p>This disease is spread by fleas or through direct contact with a sick person. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Fleas are common inhabitants of the fur of rats so outbreaks of the plague have been correlated with peaks in rat populations.&nbsp; In the 6th century the plague ravaged the world for about 50 years and caused 100 million deaths.</p>
<p>This nasty disease visited Europe again in the 14th century and killed 25 million people which was about 25% of the total European population.</p>
<p>Slide 5<br>Today we can treat Yersinia pestis with antibiotics but it still exists and makes people sick - even in the US where there are about 10 cases per year.</p>
<p>Slide 6<br>Discussions about bacteria in the popular press are usually focused on the bad things that bacteria do like make us sick. &nbsp;</p>
<p>However, most bacteria either do not affect us directly or are beneficial.&nbsp; We rely on bacteria to help us synthesize vitamins, maintain a healthy digestive tract, and develop our immune systems.&nbsp; Bacteria play an essential role as recyclers of organic material in the environment and help keep soils fertile so plants can continue to grow.</p>
<p>We have also learned to use bacteria in beneficial ways - we now use bacteria to make human medicines - for example, we use bacteria to make insulin for the treatment of people with diabetes.</p>
<p>We also have learned to use bacteria to help us clean our environment - bioremediation is the process of using biological organisms like bacteria to clean up the environment.&nbsp; We can use bacteria to eat oil spills and chemical spills - this is, of course, due to the fact that prokaryotes have such diverse metabolic modes.</p>
