<h2>Fungi I Part 2 VoiceThread Transcript</h2>
<p>Slide 1</p>
<p>Phylum Chytridiomycota - or the chytrids are sometimes classified as protists but we now know that they belong in the fungi. This is not a monophyletic group so we know they will be reorganized. &nbsp;</p>
<p>These organisms are mostly aquatic - fungi evolved in the water so this is considered a primitive trait in this group.</p>
<p>Members of this group are both saprobes and parasites.</p>
<p>Some have flagellated spores (only motile cells in kingdom) and this is the distinguishing characteristic of this group.</p>
<p>While some sources classify these organisms as a protist group - they do have a cell wall made of chitin which places them in the fungi.</p>
<p>Slide 2</p>
<p>Today, a major threat to frogs is the chytrid fungus. This fungus feeds on keratin, a component of skin that makes it sturdy and tough. Tadpoles have only a little keratin around their mouths. But as frogs grow, their skin thickens on the soles of their feet and anywhere else their bodies repeatedly come in contact with the ground, such as the lower abdomen. So while the fungus doesn't usually affect tadpoles, it can kill adult frogs.<br>Researchers aren't yet sure of exactly how the fungus kills the frogs. The two prevailing theories are that the fungus produces lethal toxins or that its presence interferes with the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide through the skin.</p>
<p>At present, scientists believe that this fungus came from African clawed frogs. The fungus does not affect them but does affect frogs that are not adapted to the fungus' presence.&nbsp; As the African clawed frog has been released into new habitats, the infection has spread.</p>
<p>Currently there is no treatment for the infection and it is esimated that as many as 1/3 of all frog species are in danger of extinction from this chytrid infection.</p>
<p>Slide 3</p>
<p>The microsporidians are a recent addition to the fungal kingdom and this is based on molecular data - particularly DNA sequence data that indicates that the microsporidians are more closely related to fungi than to any other group. &nbsp;</p>
<p>This group lacks functional mitochondria - instead they have mitosomes - structures similar to the mitosomes seen in some of the other organisms that we have looked at that used to be classified as "Archaezoa" that we learned about in our study of the protists. When we first learned about these organisms we originally classified them into these protist groups - however, we now know that they are members of the fungi.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is an important group of organisms mainly because they are all intracellular parasites - mainly of invertebrate animals but a few species infect humans - particularly humans with compromised immune systems and this compromization of the immune system occurs when people develop diseases such as AIDS or have existing genetic conditions which compromise their immune health. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some of these organisms, however, may be beneficial to human health because we may be able to use them to kill other pest species.&nbsp; For example, their is a group of microsporidians that specialize in infecting mosquitoes.&nbsp; Mosquitos are a vector for the human disease malaria.&nbsp; Malaria is the number one cause of infectious disease world-wide and kills almost 1 million people per year - mostly children.</p>
<p>Slide 4<br>Phylum zygomycota is comprised mainly of individuals that are terrestrial saprobes - bread mold is probably the most familiar representative of this group.</p>
<p>This is not a monophyletic group and most reproduction in this group is asexual.</p>
<p>When they do reproduce sexually, they produce a heterokaryotic structure known as a Zygosporangium - which is the distinguising feature of this group.</p>
<p>They are an ecologically important group because many of them are Mycorrhizae - the fungi that live symbiotically with plant roots.&nbsp; In fact, about 90% of all plant species are known to have mycorrhizal fungi living with them.<br>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Slide 5</p>
<p>The life cycle of the zygomycota shows the processes of plasmogamy, karyogamy, and the formation of the dikaryon.</p>
<p>Two individuals of opposite mating type fuse together during plasmogamy to form the dikaryon - in this group it is a zygosporangium.</p>
<p>Within the zygosporangium, karyogamy takes place to produce the diploid stage.</p>
<p>The diploid cells undergo meiosis to produce haploid spores which are released from the parent fungus to produce more individuals.</p>
<p>Slide 6</p>
<p>Members of the Zygomycota are used to produce some important products such as anesthetics, birth control pills, meat tenderizers,cortisones, pigments, tempeh,and soy sauce.</p>
<p>Slide 7</p>
<p>Phylum Glomeromycota is comprised of fungi that are arbuscular (shrub-like) mycorrhize that grow into the cells of plant roots.&nbsp; These fungi help plants capture nutrients such as phosphorous, sulfur, nitrogen, and micronutrients - all from the soil.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is believed that the development of the arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis played a crucial role in the initial colonization of land by plants and in the evolution of the vascular plants.</p>
<p>Most land plants have mycorrhizal symbionts and studies have shown that when these symbionts are taken away - the plants do not grow as well.</p>
<p>Our knowledge of mycorrhizae is relatively new and it is beginning to influence our undertanding of agriculture and plant ecology.&nbsp; For plants to grow well we need to care not only for them but for their fungal symbionts as well.&nbsp; So remember, unhappy fungi means unhappy plants and that can mean less for us to eat.</p>
