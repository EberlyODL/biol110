<h3 id="ProkaryotesIII-EvolutionandEarlyMetabolism-IntroductionandLearningObjectives">Introduction and Learning Objectives</h3>
<p>The last two tutorials discussed the diversity of prokaryotes, their structure, and their diverse metabolisms. Prokaryotes can use a variety of nitrogen and carbon sources, and in doing so they are important members of the biosphere. Prokaryotes also are involved in important relationships with many other types of organisms. After working through this tutorial you should understand:</p>
<ul><li>How bacteria can be beneficial</li><li>Symbiotic relationships between prokaryotes and other life forms</li><li>Nitrogen use and the prokaryote</li><li>Oxygen and metabolic relationships</li><li>Origins of metabolic processes</li></ul>
<p>Performance Objectives:</p>
<ul><li>Categorize the different types of relationships seen among organisms and be able to cite examples of each type in the bacteria</li><li>Describe the impact of prokaryotes on the environment of the early Earth</li></ul>
