<p><strong>Proteins</strong>&nbsp;are polymers that are functionally and structurally diverse. The digestive enzymes that break apart your food are proteins. The pigment that affects skin color, melanin, is a protein. Silk is a protein. Proteins move your muscles, attack invading bacteria and viruses, and transport oxygen to all of the cells in your body. The main biological functions of proteins include structural and mechanical roles (e.g, actin and myosin in muscle cells), and their roles as enzymes (e.g., amylase â€“ a digestive enzyme).</p>
<p>The basic monomer of proteins is the&nbsp;<strong>amino acid</strong>. The general structure of an amino acid is shown here. Note, this basic structure contains an "R" group that is variable in chemical composition. Typically there are twenty different R-groups, and hence the same number of commonly seen amino acids.These figures show the twenty different amino acids and their R-groups. Note that the amino acids are classified as nonpolar, polar, or charged based on the chemical characteristics of the R-groups.&nbsp; How will these different R-groups behave in water?</p>

<p><strong>Polypeptides</strong>&nbsp;are a polymer (chain) of amino acids. Proteins consist of one or more polypeptide chains arranged in a specific conformation. The order of amino acids in a particular polypeptide chain is determined by the specific gene for that chain. In other words, every polypeptide chain has a corresponding gene.</p>
<p>The animation shown here illustrates the formation of a polypeptide. Do not simply think of proteins as linear strings of amino acids. In reality, they fold into a three-dimensional structure and take on complex shapes (basic protein structure is discussed in the Real Life Example on the next page).</p><peptide-formation-element></peptide-formation-element><p></p>
