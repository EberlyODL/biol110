<p>Slide 1 We have arrived at our last group of animals - the chordates. The chordates fall within the deuterostomes.</p>
<p>Slide 2 The characteristics of Phylum Chordata are a hollow, dorsal nerve cord, a notochord, pharyngeal gill slits, and a post anal tail.</p>
<p>Slide 3 This diagram shows the characteristics of the chordates - all chordates have these characteristics at some point in their development.</p>

<p>Slide 4 There are three subphyla within the chordates - the Urochordata, the Cephalochordata, and the group that we are in - the Vertebrata. Slide 5 The Urochordates are commonly referred to as the Tunicates or Seasquirts. The larvae of this group have all of the 4 chordate characteristics. The adults lose the notochord, nerve cord, and post-anal tail but retain the pharyngeal gill slits. The adults are sessile organisms that live in the shallow regions oceans attached to rocks and other stationary structures.</p>
<p>Slide 6 This image shows both adult and larval individuals- the larvae have all 4 chordate characteristics while the adults only have pharyngeal gill slits.</p>
<p>Slide 7 Subphylum Cephalochordata are commonly referred to as lancelets or amphioxus. They are another marine group and the adults have all 4 chordate characteristics. These organisms bury themselves in the sediment in shallow sandy beach regions and filter feed the food particles that float by. They only emerge to reproduce and they lead a very exciting life.</p>
