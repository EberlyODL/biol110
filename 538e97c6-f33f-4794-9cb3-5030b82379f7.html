<p>This tutorial will cover the vast and variable Kingdom Fungi, and its &nbsp;impact on the environment.&nbsp;<strong>Fungi</strong>&nbsp;(fungus, sing.), like bacteria, are most commonly decomposers, assisting in the essential task of recycling nutrients in ecosystems. The majority of all plant species depend on symbiotic fungi for enhanced water and nutrient absorption. Other species have been exploited by humans for centuries for the production of bread, beer, wine, cheese, and edible fruiting bodies (mushrooms). Antibiotic-producing fungi (e.g.,&nbsp;<em>Pennicillium chysogenum</em>) have changed the face of modern medicine, saving millions of lives. Conversely, other species cause economically important and often devastating diseases to plants and animals (humans included). Fungal-induced plant disease epidemics have had dramatic historical influences, resulting in starvation, war, and human migration. Fungi are also responsible for the rots that damage timber, agricultural products, and human-made structures. Some fungi produce conspicuous fruiting bodies in a variety of shapes and sizes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>By the end of this tutorial you should have a fundamental understanding of:</p>
<ul><li>The roles and importance of fungi in the biosphere</li><li>Basic fungal nutrition</li><li>Basic morphological diversity within the kingdom</li><li>Basic reproductive features of fungi</li></ul>
<p>Performance Objectives(these are the same for both the Fungi I and Fungi II tutorials):</p>
<ul><li>Identify the general characteristics of the fungi</li><li>Explain how the “body” of the fungus is adapted for its mode of nutrition</li><li>Diagram the general fungal life cycle and describe the difference between plasmogamy and karyogamy</li><li>Summarize the basic classification of fungi</li><li>Describe the different types of symbiotic relationships that fungi participate in</li><li>For each taxonomic group of fungi, identify the major characteristic(s) of that group and be able to discuss representatives that demonstrate the diversity of the group</li><li>Explain different ways in which fungi impact humans, either directly or indirectly</li></ul>
