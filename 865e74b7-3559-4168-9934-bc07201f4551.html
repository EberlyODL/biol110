<h2>Mendel and Modern Genetics Part 1 VoiceThread Transcript</h2>
<p>Slide 1<br>We are now beginning to learn about genetics.&nbsp; To introduce the topic of genetics - we will start at the beginning with the father of genetics - Gregor Mendel.&nbsp; Mendel was an Austrian monk and scientist who lived and worked in a monastary during the mid-1800s.&nbsp; He is famous for his work on the inheritance of traits in garden peas.&nbsp; Mendel showed that the inheritance of these traits follows particular laws, which were later named after him. The significance of Mendel's work was not recognized until the turn of the 20th century and the rediscovery of these laws form the foundation of the modern science of genetics.</p>
<p>Slide 2<br>Mendel's work was very methodical.&nbsp; The characters he chose to analyze were what we call "either-or" characters.&nbsp; For example, in pea plants the flowers are either purple or white - they are the only two colors.&nbsp; This image shows an example of a typical Mendelian cross - he would cross two individuals of opposite character - in this example purple crossed with white.&nbsp; This first generation cross is known as the p-generation and the individuals in this cross are always true-breeding.&nbsp; This means that if you cross a true-breeding purple flowered plant with itself (this is possible in plants) - it will only produce purple flowered offspring - it breeds true for purple flower color.&nbsp; The same with the white flowered plant - cross it withitself and it produces white flowered offspring only.</p>
<p>The generation that resulted from this cross is called the F1 generation.&nbsp; In this particular cross - all the F1 individuals are purple flowered.</p>
<p>A cross of individuals from the F1 results in the F2 generation - and in this particular cross the F2 is comprised of a mix of purple and white flowered individuals in a 3 purple : 1 white ratio.</p>
<p>Slide 3<br>The characters that Mendel followed are genetic traits - they are due to the action of genes.&nbsp; A gene is essentially a piece of DNA&nbsp; (the material that chromosomes are made of) that codes for a specific character in an organism.&nbsp; So for example, there is a gene that determines flower color in pea plants.</p>
<p>Slide 4<br>An allele is a variant of a gene - alleles are repsonsible for the genetic variation within a population.&nbsp; In our example of flower color, there are two alleles - purple and white that determine whether a flower is purple or white.</p>
<p>Slide 5<br>The alleles that an individual has determines its genotype.&nbsp; So, for example, a pea plant with white flowers has two copies of the white allele.&nbsp; Remember, most of the the organisms that we will discuss in this course are diploid - they have two copies of each chromosome and thus two copies of each gene found on those chromosomes.</p>
<p>An organisms phenotype refers to its physical characteristics.&nbsp; So an organism with two white alleles (its genotype) has the phenotype of white flowers.</p>
<p>Slide 6<br>Here we see a visual example of genotype and phenotype.&nbsp; In pea plants, the purple allele (which is indicated with an upper case P) is dominant.&nbsp; That means that it gets expressed in any individual who inherits it.&nbsp; So an organism that has two copies of the capital P allele or a single copy will have purple flowers.&nbsp; When an organism has two alleles that are the same (for example, PP) we say they are homozygous for that gene.&nbsp; When an organism has two alleles that are different (for example, Pp) we say that organism is heterozygous for that gene.&nbsp; In this example, a homozygous individual can either be homozygous dominant (PP) or homozygous recessive (pp). &nbsp;</p>
<p>The white allele is recessive.&nbsp; This means that only individuals who have two copies of the white allele will have white flowers.</p>
