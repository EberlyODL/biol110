<p>Sexually reproducing eukaryotes undergo a series of events that can be depicted as a life cycle. There are some differences in the details of various life cycles, but the life cycle describes how the genetic composition of the cells involved in reproduction alternates between a haploid (1n) and diploid (2n) state. At some point in the life cycle, two haploid gametes fuse resulting in a diploid (2n) organism.&nbsp; Later in the life cycle, one or more cells in this 2n organism undergo meiosis, giving rise to haploid gametes that can form the next generation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All eukaryotic organisms have the majority of their DNA arranged in a set of linear chromosomes found within the nucleus. Humans have 46 chromosomes (2n). Our gametes have 23 chromosomes (1n). Each of us received half of our chromosomes from each parent. However, the combination of 23 chromosomes received from each of our parents was not the same complement that our siblings received (which explains why most siblings look similar but nonidentical).</p>
<p>Each of our 23 haploid chromosomes has a similar but nonidentical partner, a homolog. It is essential to remember that homologs are&nbsp;<strong>NOT</strong>&nbsp;identical. Therefore, humans have 23 pairs of homologous chromosomes. During meiosis, these homologs will be segregated into four progeny cells, each of which will have a haploid chromosome complement. The cellular process by which these similar, yet nonidentical, chromosomes are physically moved during meiosis results in a random distribution of the 23 chromosomes into the haploid cells. Because this process occurs randomly, we can use statistics to predict the number of possible outcomes.</p>
<p>In metaphase I of meiosis, the replicated chromosomes appear situated in a row with the homologs lined up opposite one another. Importantly, how they pair is random. For example, the paternal homolog of chromosome 1 may line up on one side, whereas the paternal homolog of chromosome 2 may line up on the other side (remember, then the maternal pair would be on opposite sides as well). The odds that the paternal member of a given homologous pair lines up on one side is equal to 50% (or 0.5 or 1:1); i.e., it goes either on one side or the other. The odds that the paternal members of two chromosomes line up on the same side is then a product of their individual probabilities; i.e., 0.5 x 0.5 = 0.25 (or 1:4). What would be the odds of all 23 paternal chromosomes lining up on one side? The solution is 2<sup>23</sup>&nbsp;or 1 in 8 million. This is also the odds of any other specific combination occurring during metaphase I. In metaphase II, the segregated homologs will separate. There is only one way this will occur, so the probabilities outlined for the events at metaphase I can be extended to the entire process of meiosis.</p>
<p>Let's put together the events occurring during meiosis for both parents. If the combination for a specific arrangement of chromosomes in each parent is 8 million, what are the odds of a specific diploid arrangement occurring? (Fertilization is somewhat random and therefore can be described statistically.) Again, the probability is a product of their independent probabilities, which is 8 million x 8 million = 64 trillion.</p>
