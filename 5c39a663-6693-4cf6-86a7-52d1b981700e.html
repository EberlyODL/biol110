<blockquote>"It is difficult for us to appreciate exactly how far back life has existed on Earth. One way to look at it is to imagine that all 4.5 billion years of geologic time is compressed into one 24-hour day. During the first second past midnight, earth forms. The origin of life would have occurred around 4:00 am. The oldest fossils known would have been deposited at 5:30 in the morning, just when the sun is coming up. The age of microscopic life starts then and continues all the way past noon, past 3:00, past 6:00, and in fact, it isn't until 9:00 at night that larger organisms appear. All of that evolution that you normally learn about in textbooks, from trilobites to fish to amphibians to reptiles to birds and mammals, all takes place in the last 3 hours of the day. Humans don't appear until just a scant few seconds before midnight." &nbsp;</blockquote>

<p></p>The Earth has been a living planet for about 4 billion years. During that time, life has evolved and diversified into the approximately 1.8 million species that have been described so far, with the possibility of between 10 and 100 million species living on the planet today. All life on Earth appears to have arisen from a single common ancestor based on the evidence that all organisms studied so far use virtually the same genetic code to transform the information in their DNA into proteins. Life has diversified into three major domains, the<strong> Bacteria</strong>, <strong>Archaea</strong>, and <strong>Eukarya</strong>. The Bacteria and Archaea have more simple cells (<strong>prokaryotes</strong>), while member of the Eukarya have complex cells with a nucleus and an array of organelles that perform different functions within the cell (<strong>eukaryotes</strong>). The figure below shows the relationships among these groups.
