<p id="ProtistsI-ProtistswithModifiedMitochondria,KingdomsEuglenozoaandAlveolata-ProtistswithModifiedMitochondria">Two groups of protists - the&nbsp;<strong>diplomonads</strong> and the&nbsp;<strong>parabasalids</strong> have modified mitochondria. The evidence suggests that each group is monophyletic but what is less clear is how closely related these two groups are to each other.

<h3 id="ProtistsI-ProtistswithModifiedMitochondria,KingdomsEuglenozoaandAlveolata-TheDiplomonads">The Diplomonads
</h3>
<p>The diplomonads have modified mitochondria (called mitosomes) that lack functional electron transport chains and thus are unable to perform cellular respiration so they derive their energy from pathways such as glycolysis (you will learn more about cellular respiration in a future tutorial). They always have flagella - but keep in mind that the structure of eukaryote flagella is distinct from the structure of prokaryotic flagella.&nbsp;These organisms are found in anaerobic environments and are often parasites.
</p>
<p>The diplomonad&nbsp;<em>Giardia</em>, is an intestinal parasite responsible for the disease giardiasis or "beaver fever," which is generally transmitted via contaminated drinking water. Giardia attaches to the intestinal epithelium, or lining, in humans and other mammals (e.g., dogs, cats, bears, and beavers), creating severe diarrhea and intestinal cramps. Unlike bacterial infections, in which a large number of organisms must be ingested to cause illness, a few&nbsp;<em>Giardia</em>&nbsp;individuals can cause a severe case of giardiasis. The parasite is endemic to many wilderness areas; infection can be prevented by treating the water either with a biofilter or with chemicals such as bleach. While it is a decidedly unpleasant disease to have, giardiasis is fairly easily treated with drugs.

<h3 id="ProtistsI-ProtistswithModifiedMitochondria,KingdomsEuglenozoaandAlveolata-TheParabasalids">The Parabasalids
</h3>
<p>[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=2447|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__right__lightboxed]The parabasalids are anaerobes that lack functional mitochondria but some species contain a structure known as a hydrogenosome that may be a degenerate mitochondrion. They also have flagella.&nbsp;Perhaps the best known parabasalids are in the genus&nbsp;<em>Trychomonas</em>&nbsp;(for example,&nbsp;<em>T. vaginalis</em> is a sexually transmitted parasite that infects millions of people a year) and are parasites of animals. However, another important group of parabasalids are endosymbionts of insects and live in these animalsâ€™ guts. For example, members of the genus&nbsp;<em>Trychonympha</em>&nbsp;are important symbionts in termite guts; the&nbsp;<em>Trychonympha</em>&nbsp;contain endosymbiotic bacteria that help them break down cellulose in the termite gut. This allows termites to consume wood (which can be a problem if they choose to eat your wooden house).
