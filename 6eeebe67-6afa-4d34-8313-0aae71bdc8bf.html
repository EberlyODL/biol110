<h2>Carbon and Life Part 1 VoiceThread Transcript</h2>
<p>Slide 1<br>Water is essential to life as we know it.&nbsp; It is a strange substance with special properties that allow it to be found normally on earth in all three states of matter: solid, liquid, and gas.</p>
<p>Water is so integral to our understanding of life that when we look for life on other planets - we look for signs of water.&nbsp; Launched in August 2007, the Phoenix Mars Mission was designed to study the history of water and habitability potential in the Martian arctic's ice-rich soil.&nbsp; In May of 2010 the Phoenix Mars Lander ended operations due to excessive ice damage to the lander.</p>
<p>Slide 2<br>The molecular formula of water is H20 - two hydrogen atoms covalently bonded to an oxygen atom. Oxygen is highly electronegative - this means that it tends to attract electrons and thus the oxygen end of the water molecule has a slight negative charge.&nbsp; The hydrogen end of the molecule has a slight positive charge.&nbsp; This distribution of charge across the molecule makes water a polar molecule. &nbsp;</p>
<p>This distribution of charge also results in the formation of hydrogen bonds between the positively charged hydrogen end of a water molecule and the negatively charged oxygen end of neighboring water molecules.</p>
<p>Slide 3<br>The hydrogen bonds that form between water molecules make the water molecules stick together.&nbsp; This contributes to some of the unique properties of water that make life possible.</p>
<p>For example, water has cohesion - which means that the water molecules stick together.&nbsp; The result is that there is surface tension at the surface of water (whether a pond, a glass of water, or a drop of water).&nbsp; This surface tension can be used by some organisms as a walking surface - such as water striders that can walk on water.</p>
<p>Water also has adhesion - which means that the water molecules will stick to another surface - such as the surface of a leaf or inside the vascular tissue of a plant.&nbsp; This adhesion allows plants to transport water (using capillary action) from the soil all the way to the leaves so photosynthesis can take place.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Slide 4<br>Water also has high specific heat and a high heat of vaporization.&nbsp; The specific heat is the amount of heat per unit mass required to raise the temperature by one degree Celsius.&nbsp; The specific heat of water is 1 calorie/gram which is higher than any other common substance. As a result, water plays a very important role in temperature regulation.&nbsp; This is particularly important near large bodies of water like the oceans - the oceans play an important role and regulating the global temperature.</p>
<p>The heat of vaporization is the amount of heat required to convert unit mass of a liquid into the vapor without a change in temperature.&nbsp; The heat of vaporization of water is higher than other common substances - this helps us to cool ourselves during hot weather.&nbsp; When we sweat, our skin becomes covered with water.&nbsp; If humidity is low, this water evaporates easily.&nbsp; The heat energy needed for this evaporation comes from our bodies - so sweating and evaporative cooling cools our bodies.&nbsp; The higher the humidity - the more water there is in the air - and the less evaporation takes place.&nbsp; This is why it is hard to cool down on hot, humid days.</p>
<p>Solid water is less dense than liquid water - this is also an usual property for matter to have.&nbsp; The result is that ice floats and organisms can live under the ice.&nbsp; If ice sank - bodies of water would tend to freeze solid in the winter and organisms could not survive.</p>
<p>Slide 5<br>Water is also an excellent solvent - which means that many things dissolve in water.&nbsp; For example, when you put crystalized salt and sugar in water - it dissolves.</p>
<p>However, water is not a perfect solvent - which is basically a good thing but can sometimes have negative consequences.&nbsp; It is a good thing because we would not want our skin and bones to dissolve in water - life would not be possible.</p>
<p>But it is a bad thing when nonsoluble hydrocarbons (these are nonpolar chains of carbon and hydrogen) get released into the water.&nbsp; This is what happens in an oil spill - oils are hydrocarbons and all hydrocarbons behave hydrophobically - they do not interact with water.&nbsp; When organisms become coated in oil - that oil cannot wash off because it does not interact with the water.&nbsp; The result is that the animal can become weighted down by the oil and drown, or the oil can disrupt the natural coating on an animal such as a bird and leave the bird suseptible to becoming too cold or too hot.&nbsp; Some animals will ingest the oil in an effort to clean themselves - the oil is toxic and can cause death.</p>
