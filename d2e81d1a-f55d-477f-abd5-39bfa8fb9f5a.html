<p>Glycolysis generates ATP without using oxygen as an electron acceptor. Therefore, glycolysis can occur whether oxygen is present or not and whether conditions are aerobic or anaerobic. Pyruvate has two general fates: it can be further oxidized (in which case, more energy is obtained) or it can be further reduced (and discarded as waste).
</p>
<p>The process by which glucose is partially broken down and NAD+ is regenerated is&nbsp;<strong>fermentation</strong>. The many types of fermentation differ in the waste products that are formed when pyruvate is broken down. Fermentation can occur in the presence or absence of oxygen. Many bacteria only carry out fermentation in the absence of oxygen, whereas yeast will ferment in the presence or absence of oxygen. Two common types of fermentation are&nbsp;<strong>alcohol fermentation</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>lactic acid fermentation</strong>. In alcohol fermentation, pyruvate gives off carbon dioxide and is converted to ethyl alcohol (ethanol) in a two-step process. In lactic acid fermentation, pyruvate is converted to lactate (lactic acid). This figure&nbsp;shows both types of fermentation.

</p>
<p>Humans capitalize on both of these fermentation processes. Yeast undergo alcohol fermentation in the production of beer and wine. Certain bacteria and fungi undergo lactic acid fermentation, and are used to make cheese and yogurt. There are many facultative anaerobes that can switch between fermentation and complete cellular respiration, depending on their environment.

<h2>A Real Life Example:&nbsp; Microorganisms and Fermentation - not just for making beer!
</h2>
<p>The method for making naturally brewed soy sauce has been in use for over 500 years. It takes place in two stages and there are different types of microorganisms involved in the process.
  <br>The first stage is aerobic and involves mixing steamed soy beans and toasted crushed wheat with two species of&nbsp;<em>Aspergillus</em>&nbsp;fungi. The fungi break down the polysaccharides (and other macromolecules) into glucose and other monomers. This is the koji stage of production.
  <br>The second, or moroni, stage is anaerobic. In this stage, salt, water and yeast are added to the koji to form a mash. This mash is then put into airtight containers where it ferments for at least 6 months. During fermentation the mix is kept warm to increase the growth of microorganisms. The mash is then squeezed to get the liquid soy sauce.
</p>
<ul><li>Is the koji stage anabolic or catabolic? During fungal digestion, glucose is formed. Is this a condensation or hydrolysis reaction?</li>
</ul>
<ul><li>In some countries, the import and production of naturally brewed soy sauce is regulated because it has an alcohol content of 2-10%. Be able to explain how this is possible (in your explanation, include the starting substrate(s) and end-product(s) of the metabolic pathway).</li>
