<p>The microsporidians are another recent addition to the Kingdom Fungi.&nbsp; They are all intracellular parasites of animals or protists, mainly affecting invertebrates. They do not have mitochondria, but they do have mitosomes. &nbsp;The presence of mitosomes, along with other fungal characteristics, distinguishes this group. &nbsp;What group do you think they were previously classified in (hint: think back to the Protists)? Microsporidians have no means of locomotion, and are able to form spores that can live outside of the host cell for long periods of time.&nbsp; Human microsporidiosis usually affects only people with compromised immune systems.&nbsp; There is research under way to see if a mosquito-specific microsporidian could be used as a way to control malaria.</p>
