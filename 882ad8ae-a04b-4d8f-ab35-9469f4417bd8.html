<p>All eukaryotes have linear chromosomes, and partitioning the chromosomes equally into daughter cells is a carefully orchestrated process.</p>
<p>Mitosis insures that each sister chromatid goes into one daughter cell as the cell divides. During this continuous process, there are landmarks that mark the progression of mitosis. These landmarks are the so-called "stages" of mitosis (prophase, prometaphase, metaphase, anaphase and telophase). Be sure you know the major criteria that demarcate one stage from the other.</p>
