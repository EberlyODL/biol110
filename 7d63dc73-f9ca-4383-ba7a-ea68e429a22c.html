<h2>Expression of Multiple Alleles Pedigrees Part 1 VoiceThread Transcript</h2>
<p>Slide 1<br>The examples we have looked at thus far, have only included genes with two alleles.</p>
<p>Many genes, however, have more than two alleles in the population - a situation referred to as multiple alleles.&nbsp; Note - each diploid individual in the population is diploid can only have at most two different alleles - but in the entire population there can be more than two alleles. &nbsp;</p>
<p>A fairly straightforward example of this is the human ABO blood group.&nbsp; There are 3 alleles - the A allele (indicated with a capital I superscript A), the B allele (indicated with a capital I and a superscript B), and the O allele indicated with a lower case i.&nbsp; Within this group there are two different dominance relationships.&nbsp; We have already discussed how allele A and allele B are codominant to each other.&nbsp; Both of these alleles (A and B), are completely dominant to allele O.&nbsp; An individual who is heterozygous for A and O has blood type A.&nbsp; Similarly for an individual who is heterozygous for B and O has blood type B.<br><br>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Slide 2<br>Sometimes a gene can have an effect on more than one aspect of an organism's phenotype.&nbsp; This situation is referred to as pleiotropy. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Slide 3<br>An example of pleiotropy is the frizzle gene in chickens.&nbsp; This gene is referred to as "frizzle" because it results in frizzy looking feathers.&nbsp; The gene that causes this phenotype also causes the chicken to have abnormal body temperature, higher metabolic and blood flow rates, and greater digestive capacity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is a single gene, we will call it gene X, that has an impact on all of these aspects of the chicken's phenotype.</p>
<p>Slide 4<br>Epistasis refers to a relationship between at least two different genes and one gene affects expression of another gene (or genes).&nbsp; A common example of epistasis is coat color in mammals. The example we are looking at here is coat color in horses.&nbsp; There are two different genes that play a role in determining coat color.&nbsp; Gene B codes for pigment - with the dominant B allele coding for black coat color and the recessive b allele coding for a lighter brown coat color.&nbsp; Gene C is epistatic on gene B (epistasis literally means "standing upon") - it determines whether or not gene B gets expressed.&nbsp; The dominant C allele allows the pigment to be deposited - so a horse that has at least one copy of the C allele will be either black or brown.&nbsp; The recessive c allele, on the other hand, blocks pigment deposition - any horse that has two copies of the c allele (is homozygous recessive for c) - will be a whitish color.&nbsp; This is because gene C is epistatic on gene B and controls whether or not it is expressed.</p>
<p>Slide 5<br>Epistasis and pleiotropy are often confused with each other but they are quite different.&nbsp; One important difference is the number of genes involved.&nbsp; Epistasis involves at least two genes but only one aspect of the phenotype is affected.&nbsp; Coat color in horses is an example - two genes but only one character - coat color.</p>
<p>Pleiotropy involves a singe gene - but the gene impacts several aspects of the phenotype - like frizzled chickens with their different body temperature and metabolism.&nbsp; A single gene caused all of these changes to the phenotype.</p>
<p>Slide 6<br>Most genetic traits are not determined by a single gene - most traits are polygenic (the prefix poly means many).&nbsp; Skin color in humans, for example, is a polygenic trait.&nbsp; Here at Penn State, Dr. Mark Shriver in the department of anthropology is attempting to work out the exact number of genes that are responsible for skin color in humans.</p>
<p>The model organism that he uses to learn more about our pigment genes is actually a small species of fish known as a zebrafish (zebrfish are common lab organisms).&nbsp; The gene that he is currently looking at is known as SLC24A5 - catch huh?&nbsp; This gene plays a role in pigment production in both zebrafish and humans.&nbsp; We know that there are other genes involved in skin color and other research groups around the world are looking at these genes.&nbsp; Some day we may know all of the genes that are responsible for skin color in humans.</p>
