<h2>Prokaryotes II Part 2 VoiceThread Transcript</h2>
<p>Slide 1<br>While prokaryotes are structurally more simple than eukaryotes - metabolically they are more diverse and capable of a much wider array of metabolic modes.</p>
<p>There are four basic metabolic modes - photoautotrophy, chemoautotrophy, photoheterotrophy, and chemoheterotrophy.</p>
<p>Slide 2<br>Eukaryotic organisms are only capable of two of these metabolic modes - photoautrophy as we see in the form of photosynthesis in the plants and chemoheterotrophy as we see in animals.</p>
<p>Slide 3<br>Metabolic modes are based on where an organism gets its energy and where it gets its carbon.&nbsp; Energy can either come from sunlight or energy-rich molecules.&nbsp; Carbon can either come from carbon dioxide or organic molecules.</p>
<p>Plants use sunlight for energy and carbon dioxide for carbon and are classified as photoautotrophs.&nbsp; Animals use organic molecules as both a carbon source and an energy source and are classified as chemoheterotrophs. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Bacteria can use photoautotrophy and chemoheterotrophy but they can also be photoheterotrophs and chemoautotrophs.</p>
<p>Slide 4<br>These diverse metabolic modes allow prokaryotes to live in diverse environments that in general do not support eukaryotic life such as hot springs, hydrothermal vents, and salt ponds.&nbsp; There are even bacteria that can survive inside nuclear reactors.</p>
